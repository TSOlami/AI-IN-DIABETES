Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals, through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback. 
We provided 27 sedentary diabetes type 2 patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent SMS messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm which optimized messages to improve each participant's compliance with the activity regimen. The RL algorithm was compared to a static policy for sending messages and to weekly reminders. 
Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the RL algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, while the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the RL algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) compared to control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise. 
Our results suggest that a mobile phone application coupled with a learning algorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. As a learning algorithm is automated, and delivers personalized messages, it could be used in large populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control. Our results can be expanded to other areas where computer-led health coaching of humans may have a positive impact.","In this paper, the authors used reinforcement learning (RL) to encourage diabetic patients to participate in physical activity, and found that participants who received messages generated by the RL algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking while the control group patients did not."

Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.","This paper uses three forecasting machines, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts."

CHO counting is very challenging but also crucial, since an error of 20 grams can substantially impair postprandial control. Method: The GoCARB system is a smartphone application designed to support T1D patients with CHO counting of nonpacked foods. In a typical scenario, the user places a reference card next to the dish and acquires 2 images with his/her smartphone. From these images, the plate is detected and the different food items on the plate are automatically segmented and recognized, while their 3D shape is reconstructed. Finally, the food volumes are calculated and the CHO content is estimated by combining the previous results and using the USDA nutritional database. Results: To evaluate the proposed system, a set of 24 multi-food dishes was used. For each dish, 3 pairs of images were taken and for each pair, the system was applied 4 times. The mean absolute percentage error in CHO estimation was 10 ± 12%, which led to a mean absolute error of 6 ± 8 CHO grams for normal-sized dishes. Conclusion: The laboratory experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the GoCARB prototype system since the error was below the initial goal of 20 grams. However, further improvements and evaluation are needed prior launching a system able to meet the inter- and intracultural eating habits.","The laboratory experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the GoCARB prototype system since the error was below the initial goal of 20 grams, however, further improvements and evaluation are needed prior launching a system able to meet the inter- and intracultural eating habits."

An artificial pancreas for automated treatment could boost quality of glucose control and patients' independence. The components required for an artificial pancreas are: i) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), ii) smart controllers and iii) insulin pumps delivering the optimal amount of insulin. In recent years, medical devices for CGM and insulin administration have undergone rapid progression and are now commercially available. Yet, clinically available devices still require regular patients' or caregivers' attention as they operate in open-loop control with frequent user intervention. Dosage-calculating algorithms are currently being studied in intensive care patients [1] , for short overnight control to supplement conventional insulin delivery [2] , and for short periods where patients rest and follow a prescribed food regime [3] . Fully automated algorithms that can respond to the varying activity levels seen in outpatients, with unpredictable and unreported food intake, and which provide the necessary personalized control for individuals is currently beyond the state-of-the-art.

Various complications are associated with type 2 diabetes, with diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of renal failure among diabetics. Often, when patients are diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, their renal functions have already been significantly damaged. Therefore, a risk prediction tool may be beneficial for the implementation of early treatment and prevention. In the present study, we developed a decision tree-based model integrating genetic and clinical features in a gender-specific classification for the identification of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 diabetic patients. Clinical and genotyping data were obtained from a previous genetic association study involving 345 type 2 diabetic patients (185 with diabetic nephropathy and 160 without diabetic nephropathy). Using a five-fold cross-validation approach, the performance of using clinical or genetic features alone in various classifiers (decision tree, random forest, Naive Bayes, and support vector machine) was compared with that of utilizing a combination of attributes. The inclusion of genetic features and the implementation of an additional gender-based rule yielded better classification results. The current model supports the notion that genes and gender are contributing factors of diabetic nephropathy. Further refinement of the proposed approach has the potential to facilitate the early identification of diabetic nephropathy and the development of more efficient treatment in a clinical setting.","A decision tree-based model integrating genetic and clinical features in a gender-specific classification for the identification of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 diabetic patients supports the notion that genes and gender are contributing factors of diabetic neutropathy."

This can be achieved by using a multivariable AP approach where biometric variables are measured and reported to the AP at high frequency. We developed a classification system that identifies, in real time, the exercise intensity and its reliance on aerobic or anaerobic metabolism and tested this approach using clinical data collected from 5 persons with T1D and 3 individuals without T1D in a controlled laboratory setting using a variety of common types of physical activity. The classifier had an average sensitivity of 98.7% for physiological data collected over a range of exercise modalities and intensities in these subjects.

To date, CGM devices are employed for both retrospective and online applications. Their use allows to better describe the patients' pathology as well as to achieve a better control of patients' level of glycemia. The analysis of CGM sensor data makes possible to observe a wide range of metrics, such as the glycemic variability during the day or the amount of time spent below or above certain glycemic thresholds. However, due to the high variability of the glycemic signals among sensors and individuals, CGM data analysis is a non-trivial task. Standard signal filtering solutions fall short when an appropriate model personalization is not applied. State-of-the-art data-driven strategies for online CGM forecasting rely upon the use of recursive filters. Each time a new sample is collected, such models need to adjust their parameters in order to predict the next glycemic level. In this paper we aim at demonstrating that the problem of online CGM forecasting can be successfully tackled by personalized machine learning models, that do not need to recursively update their parameters.","This paper aims at demonstrating that the problem of online CGM forecasting can be successfully tackled by personalized machine learning models, that do not need to recursively update their parameters."

Mobile devices informing patients about their future blood glucose levels could enable them to take counter-measures to prevent hypo or hyper periods. Previous work addressed this challenge by predicting the blood glucose levels using regression models. However, these approaches required a physiological model, representing the human body's response to insulin and glucose intake, or are not directly applicable to mobile platforms (smart phones, tablets). In this paper, we propose an algorithm for mobile platforms to predict blood glucose levels without the need for a physiological model. Using an online software simulator program, we trained a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and exported the parameter settings to our mobile platform. The prediction accuracy of our mobile platform was evaluated with pre-recorded data of a type 1 diabetes patient. The blood glucose level was predicted with an error of 19 % compared to the true value. Considering the permitted error of commercially used devices of 15 %, our algorithm is the basis for further development of mobile prediction algorithms.","An algorithm for mobile platforms to predict blood glucose levels without the need for a physiological model is proposed, and is the basis for further development of mobile prediction algorithms."

This is necessary as it is important to maintain glucose levels at appropriate values to avoid not only short-term, but also long-term complications of the illness. Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning techniques in particular have already lead to promising results in modeling and predicting glucose concentrations. In this work, several machine learning techniques are used for the modeling and prediction of glucose concentrations using as inputs the values measured by a continuous monitoring glucose system as well as also previous and estimated future carbohydrate intakes and insulin injections. In particular, we use the following four techniques: genetic programming, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and grammatical evolution. We propose two new enhanced modeling algorithms for glucose prediction, namely (i) a variant of grammatical evolution which uses an optimized grammar, and (ii) a variant of tree-based genetic programming which uses a three-compartment model for carbohydrate and insulin dynamics. The predictors were trained and tested using data of ten patients from a public hospital in Spain. We analyze our experimental results using the Clarke error grid metric and see that 90% of the forecasts are correct (i.e., Clarke error categories A and B), but still even the best methods produce 5 to 10% of serious errors (category D) and approximately 0.5% of very serious errors (category E). We also propose an enhanced genetic programming algorithm that incorporates a three-compartment model into symbolic regression models to create smoothed time series of the original carbohydrate and insulin time series.","An enhanced genetic programming algorithm is proposed that incorporates a three-compartment model into symbolic regression models to create smoothed time series of the original carbohydrate and insulin time series."

In this study, the s.c. glucose prediction is treated as a multivariate regression problem, which is addressed using support vector regression (SVR). The proposed method is based on variables concerning: 1) the s.c. glucose profile; 2) the plasma insulin concentration; 3) the appearance of meal-derived glucose in the systemic circulation; and 4) the energy expenditure during physical activities. Six cases corresponding to different combinations of the aforementioned variables are used to investigate the influence of the input on the daily glucose prediction. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset of 27 patients in free-living conditions. Tenfold cross validation is applied to each dataset individually to both optimize and test the SVR model. In the case, where all the input variables are considered, the average prediction errors are 5.21, 6.03, 7.14, and 7.62 mg/dl for 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min prediction horizons, respectively.

For example, in the therapy of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), in which, for patient safety, glucose concentration in the blood should be maintained in a defined normoglycemic range, the ability to forecast glucose concentration in the short-term (with a prediction horizon of around 30 min) might be sufficient to reduce the incidence of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events. Neural Network (NN) approaches are suitable for prediction purposes because of their ability to model nonlinear dynamics and handle in their inputs signals coming from different domains. In this chapter we illustrate the design of a jump NN glucose prediction algorithm that exploits past glucose concentration data, measured in real-time by a minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, and information on ingested carbohydrates, supplied by the patient himself or herself. The methodology is assessed by tuning the NN on data of ten T1D individuals and then testing it on a dataset of ten different subjects. Results with a prediction horizon of 30 min show that prediction of glucose concentration in T1D via NN is feasible and sufficiently accurate. The average time anticipation obtained is compatible with the generation of preventive hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic alerts and the improvement of artificial pancreas performance.","Results with a prediction horizon of 30 min show that prediction of glucose concentration in T1D via NN is feasible and sufficiently accurate and the average time anticipation obtained is compatible with the generation of preventive hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic alerts and the improvement of artificial pancreas performance."

The proposed system, which runs on a smartphone, keeps the simplicity of a standard bolus calculator while enhancing its performance by providing more adaptability and flexibility. This is achieved by means of applying a retrospective optimization of the insulin bolus therapy using a novel combination of run-to-run (R2R) that uses intermittent continuous glucose monitoring data, and case-based reasoning (CBR). The validity of the proposed approach has been proven by in-silico studies using the FDA-accepted UVa-Padova type 1 diabetes simulator. Tests under more realistic in-silico scenarios are achieved by updating the simulator to emulate intrasubject insulin sensitivity variations and uncertainty in the capillarity measurements and carbohydrate intake. The CBR(R2R) algorithm performed well in simulations by significantly reducing the mean blood glucose, increasing the time in euglycemia and completely eliminating hypoglycaemia. Finally, compared to an R2R stand-alone version of the algorithm, the CBR(R2R) algorithm performed better in both adults and adolescent populations, proving the benefit of the utilization of CBR. In particular, the mean blood glucose improved from $166\pm 39$ to $150\pm 16$ in the adult populations ( $p=0.03$ ) and from $167\pm 25$ to $162\pm 23$ in the adolescent population ( $p=0.06$ ). In addition, CBR(R2R) was able to completely eliminate hypoglycaemia, while the R2R alone was not able to do it in the adolescent population.","The proposed system, which runs on a smartphone, keeps the simplicity of a standard bolus calculator while enhancing its performance by providing more adaptability and flexibility and the CBR(R2R) algorithm performed better in both adults and adolescent populations, proving the benefit of the utilization of CBR."

The recent availability of mobile phones with enhanced capabilities, together with the advances in computer vision, have permitted the development of image analysis apps for the automated assessment of meals. GoCARB is a mobile phone-based system designed to support individuals with type 1 diabetes during daily carbohydrate estimation. In a typical scenario, the user places a reference card next to the dish and acquires two images using a mobile phone. A series of computer vision modules detect the plate and automatically segment and recognize the different food items, while their 3D shape is reconstructed. Finally, the carbohydrate content is calculated by combining the volume of each food item with the nutritional information provided by the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of the GoCARB prototype when used by individuals with type 1 diabetes and to compare it to their own performance in carbohydrate counting. In addition, the user experience and usability of the system is evaluated by questionnaires. Methods: The study was conducted at the Bern University Hospital, “Inselspital” (Bern, Switzerland) and involved 19 adult volunteers with type 1 diabetes, each participating once. Each study day, a total of six meals of broad diversity were taken from the hospital’s restaurant and presented to the participants. The food items were weighed on a standard balance and the true amount of carbohydrate was calculated from the USDA nutrient database. Participants were asked to count the carbohydrate content of each meal independently and then by using GoCARB. At the end of each session, a questionnaire was completed to assess the user’s experience with GoCARB. Results: The mean absolute error was 27.89 (SD 38.20) grams of carbohydrate for the estimation of participants, whereas the corresponding value for the GoCARB system was 12.28 (SD 9.56) grams of carbohydrate, which was a significantly better performance (P=.001). In 75.4% (86/114) of the meals, the GoCARB automatic segmentation was successful and 85.1% (291/342) of individual food items were successfully recognized. Most participants found GoCARB easy to use. Conclusions: This study indicates that the system is able to estimate, on average, the carbohydrate content of meals with higher accuracy than individuals with type 1 diabetes can. The participants thought the app was useful and easy to use. GoCARB seems to be a well-accepted supportive mHealth tool for the assessment of served-on-a-plate meals.

A real-time patient monitoring and feedback system is one of the solutions to help patients with diabetes and their healthcare professionals monitor health-related measurements and provide dynamic feedback. However, data-driven methods to dynamically prioritize and generate tasks are not well investigated in the domain of remote health monitoring. This paper presents a wireless health project (WANDA) that leverages sensor technology and wireless communication to monitor the health status of patients with diabetes. The WANDA dynamic task management function applies data analytics in real-time to discretize continuous features, applying data clustering and association rule mining techniques to manage a sliding window size dynamically and to prioritize required user tasks. The developed algorithm minimizes the number of daily action items required by patients with diabetes using association rules that satisfy a minimum support, confidence and conditional probability thresholds. Each of these tasks maximizes information gain, thereby improving the overall level of patient adherence and satisfaction.

Many approaches based on artificial network and machine learning algorithms have been developed and tested against diabetes datasets, which were mostly related to individuals of Pima Indian origin. Yet, despite high accuracies of up to 99% in predicting the correct diabetes diagnosis, none of these approaches have reached clinical application so far. One reason for this failure may be that diabetologists or clinical investigators are sparsely informed about, or trained in the use of, computational diagnosis tools. Therefore, this article aims at sketching out an outline of the wide range of options, recent developments, and potentials in machine learning algorithms as diabetes diagnosis tools. One focus is on supervised and unsupervised methods, which have made significant impacts in the detection and diagnosis of diabetes at primary and advanced stages. Particular attention is paid to algorithms that show promise in improving diabetes diagnosis. A key advance has been the development of a more in-depth understanding and theoretical analysis of critical issues related to algorithmic construction and learning theory. These include trade-offs for maximizing generalization performance, use of physically realistic constraints, and incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty. The review presents and explains the most accurate algorithms, and discusses advantages and pitfalls of methodologies. This should provide a good resource for researchers from all backgrounds interested in computational intelligence-based diabetes diagnosis methods, and allows them to extend their knowledge into this kind of research.","An outline of the wide range of options, recent developments, and potentials in machine learning algorithms as diabetes diagnosis tools is sketches out, which includes supervised and unsupervised methods, which have made significant impacts in the detection and diagnosis of diabetes at primary and advanced stages."

Nevertheless, most of the people who have diabetes lead a sedentary lifestyle. Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback. Objective: The aim of this study was to help type 2 diabetes patients increase the level of their physical activity. Methods: We provided 27 sedentary type 2 diabetes patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent short message service messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning algorithm so as to improve each participant’s compliance with the activity regimen. The algorithm was compared with a static policy for sending messages and weekly reminders. Results: Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the learning algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, whereas the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the learning algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) compared with control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise. Conclusions: Mobile phone apps coupled with a learning algorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. This algorithm can be used in large populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control.

Glucose levels are generally stable in healthy people; however, they are quite variable in patients with diabetes. This glycemic variability in patients with diabetes involves interprandial hypoglycemia and periods of post-prandial and acute hyperglycemia.

SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits.

The predictor combines a neural network (NN) model and a first-order polynomial extrapolation algorithm, used in parallel to describe, respectively, the nonlinear and the linear components of glucose dynamics. Information on the glucose rate of appearance after a meal is described by a previously published physiological model.

Professional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which produces a glucose reading every 5 min, is a powerful tool for retrospective identification of unrecognized hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, CGM devices tend to be inaccurate, especially in the hypoglycemic range, which limits their applicability for hypoglycemia detection. The objective of this study was to develop an automated pattern recognition algorithm to detect hypoglycemic events in retrospective, professional CGM. Method: Continuous glucose monitoring and plasma glucose (PG) readings were obtained from 17 data sets of 10 type 1 diabetes patients undergoing insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The CGM readings were automatically classified into a hypoglycemic group and a nonhypoglycemic group on the basis of different features from CGM readings and insulin injection. The classification was evaluated by comparing the automated classification with PG using sample-based and event-based sensitivity and specificity measures. Results: With an event-based sensitivity of 100%, the algorithm produced only one false hypoglycemia detection. The sample-based sensitivity and specificity levels were 78% and 96%, respectively. Conclusions: The automated pattern recognition algorithm provides a new approach for detecting unrecognized hypoglycemic events in professional CGM data. The tool may assist physicians and diabetologists in conducting a more thorough evaluation of the diabetes patient’s glycemic control and in initiating necessary measures for improving glycemic control.","The automated pattern recognition algorithm provides a new approach for detecting unrecognized hypoglycemic events in professional CGM data that may assist physicians and diabetologists in conducting a more thorough evaluation of the diabetes patient's glycemic control and in initiating necessary measures for improving glycemic Control."

The aim of this study is to design and evaluate a hypoglycemia / hyperglycemia early warning system (EWS) for T1DM patients under sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy.

Methods: The EWS is based on the combination of data-driven online adaptive prediction models and a warning algorithm. Three modeling approaches have been investigated: (i) autoregressive (ARX) models, (ii) auto-regressive with an output correction module (cARX) models, and (iii) recurrent neural network (RNN) models. The warning algorithm performs postprocessing of the models′ outputs and issues alerts if upcoming hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events are detected. Fusion of the cARX and RNN models, due to their complementary prediction performances, resulted in the hybrid autoregressive with an output correction module/recurrent neural network (cARN)-based EWS.

Results: The EWS was evaluated on 23 T1DM patients under SAP therapy. The ARX-based system achieved hypoglycemic (hyperglycemic) event prediction with median values of accuracy of 100.0% (100.0%), detection time of 10.0 (8.0) min, and daily false alarms of 0.7 (0.5). The respective values for the cARX-based system were 100.0% (100.0%), 17.5 (14.8) min, and 1.5 (1.3) and, for the RNN-based system, were 100.0% (92.0%), 8.4 (7.0) min, and 0.1 (0.2). The hybrid cARN-based EWS presented outperforming results with 100.0% (100.0%) prediction accuracy, detection 16.7 (14.7) min in advance, and 0.8 (0.8) daily false alarms.

Conclusion: Combined use of cARX and RNN models for the development of an EWS outperformed the single use of each model, achieving accurate and prompt event prediction with few false alarms, thus providing increased safety and comfort.","Combined use of cARX and RNN models for the development of an EWS outperformed the single use of each model, achieving accurate and prompt event prediction with few false alarms, thus providing increased safety and comfort."

Low blood glucose, also known as hypoglycemia, can be a dangerous and can result in unconsciousness, seizures and even death. In recent studies, heart rate (HR) and correct QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal are found as the most common physiological parameters to be effected from hypoglycemic reaction. In this paper, a state-of-the-art intelligent technology namely deep belief network (DBN) is developed as an intelligent diagnostics system to recognize the onset of hypoglycemia. The proposed DBN provides a superior classification performance with feature transformation on either processed or un-processed data. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hypoglycemia detection system, 15 children with Type 1 diabetes were volunteered overnight.

However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques. To realize high-accuracy, low-cost and continuous glucose monitoring, we have developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller. This method is based on the combination of the conservation-of-energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples. Thus, this system demonstrates a great potential to reliably detect BG values in a non-invasive setting.","This work has developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller, based on the combination of the conservation-of-energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation, blood flow velocity and heart rate."

Physiological models are very precise but they are typically complex and specific physiological knowledge is required. In contrast, data-based models allow the incorporation of additional inputs and accurately capture the relationship between these inputs and the outcome, but at the cost of losing the physiological meaning of the model. In this work, we designed a hybrid approach comprising physiological models for insulin and grammatical evolution, taking into account the clinical harm caused by deviations from the target blood glucose by using a penalizing fitness function based on the Clarke error grid. The prediction models were built using data obtained over 14 days for 100 virtual patients generated by the UVA/Padova T1D simulator. Midterm blood glucose was predicted for the 100 virtual patients using personalized models and different scenarios. The results obtained were promising; an average of 98.31% of the predictions fell in zones A and B of the Clarke error grid. Midterm predictions using personalized models are feasible when the configuration of grammatical evolution explored in this study is used. The study of new alternative models is important to move forward in the development of alarm-and-control applications for the management of type 1 diabetes and the customization of the patient's treatments.

In some cases, patients with type 2 diabetes not only behave differently from other patients, but the severity of a given health problem varies even for an individual patient. We focus on understanding how and when patients differ from other patients. In addition, we also look at the diversity that exists within an individual patient especially over time-periods throughout the day. Our aim is to identify such time intervals when a patient may need more targeted care. Thus, for type 2 Diabetes we identify which time-periods exhibit a mismatch in terms of the blood glucose readings and the insulin doses. For instance, if the blood glucose readings fluctuate and the insulin doses are fixed it may indicate a poor management of the insulin doses and therefore a poor management of Diabetes. Based on such findings a number of factors can be taken into consideration when drawing out a care plan for example diet, lifestyle, and type of treatment, among others. Our study uses a data mining approach, particularly clustering to study the measurements in blood glucose and doses of regular insulin for a selected number of patients.

As the starting point, an inclusive list of (k) diabetes complications and (n) their correlated predisposing factors are derived from the existing endocrinology text books. A type of data meta-analysis has been done to extract and combine the numeric value of the relationships between these two. The whole n (risk factors) - k (complications) model was broken down into k different (n-1) relationships and these (n-1) dependencies were broken into n (1-1) models. Applying regression analysis (seven patterns) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we created models to show the (1-1) correspondence between factors and complications. Then all 1-1 models related to an individual complication were integrated using the naive Bayes theorem. Finally, a Bayesian belief network was developed to show the influence of all risk factors and complications on each other. We assessed the predictive power of the 1-1 models by R2, F-ratio and adjusted R2 equations; sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the final model using real patient data.

Simulations of meals with varied fat content demonstrably replicated published data. Subsequently, an insulin profile library with optimized delivery regimens under open and closed loop for various meal compositions was constructed using particle swarm optimization. Calculations showed that the optimal basal bolus insulin profiles for low-fat meals comprise a normal bolus or a short wave. The preferred delivery for high-fat meals is typically biphasic, but can extend to multiple phases depending on meal characteristics. Results also revealed that patients that are highly sensitive to insulin could benefit from biphasic deliveries.

Inputs to the NNM included CGM values, insulin dosages, metered glucose values, nutritional intake, lifestyle, and emotional factors. Performance of the NNM was assessed in 10 patients not included in the model training set. Results: The NNM had a root mean squared error of 43.9 mg/dL and a mean absolute difference percentage of 22.1. The NNM routinely overestimates hypoglycemic extremes, which can be attributed to the limited number of hypoglycemic reactions in ...","Real-time prediction of glucose via the proposed feed-forward neural network model (NNM) may provide a means of intelligent therapeutic guidance and direction."

Machine learning algorithms have been embedded into data mining pipelines, which can combine them with classical statistical strategies, to extract knowledge from data. Within the EU-funded MOSAIC project, a data mining pipeline has been used to derive a set of predictive models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications based on electronic health record data of nearly one thousand patients. Such pipeline comprises clinical center profiling, predictive model targeting, predictive model construction and model validation. After having dealt with missing data by means of random forest (RF) and having applied suitable strategies to handle class imbalance, we have used Logistic Regression with stepwise feature selection to predict the onset of retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy, at different time scenarios, at 3, 5, and 7 years from the first visit at the Hospital Center for Diabetes (not from the diagnosis). Considered variables are gender, age, time from diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and smoking habit. Final models, tailored in accordance with the complications, provided an accuracy up to 0.838. Different variables were selected for each complication and time scenario, leading to specialized models easy to translate to the clinical practice.","Logistic Regression with stepwise feature selection is used to predict the onset of retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy, at different time scenarios, at 3, 5, and 7 years from the first visit at the Hospital Center for Diabetes."

In particular, hypo and hyperglycemia can be promptly detected when glucose exceeds the normal range thresholds, and even avoided through the use of on-line glucose prediction algorithms. Several algorithms with prediction horizon (PH) of 15–30–45 min have been proposed in the literature, e.g. including AR/ARMA time-series modeling and neural networks. Most of them are fed by CGM signals only. The purpose of this work is to develop a new short-term glucose prediction algorithm based on a neural network that, in addition to past CGM readings, also exploits information on carbohydrates intakes quantitatively described through a physiological model. Results on simulated data quantitatively show that the new method outperforms other published algorithms.

The four models are based on a feedforward neural network (FNN), a self-organizing map (SOM), a neuro-fuzzy network with wavelets as activation functions (WFNN), and a linear regression model (LRM), respectively. For the development and evaluation of the models, data from 10 patients with T1DM for a 6-day observation period have been used. The models’ predictive performance is evaluated considering a 30-, 60- and 120-min prediction horizon, using both mathematical and clinical criteria. Furthermore, the addition of input data from sensors monitoring physical activity is considered and its effect on the models’ predictive performance is investigated. The continuous glucose-error grid analysis indicates that the models’ predictive performance benefits mainly in the hypoglycemic range when additional information related to physical activity is fed into the models. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of SOM over FNN, WFNN, and LRM with SOM leading to better predictive performance in terms of both mathematical and clinical evaluation criteria.","Comparing assessment of four glucose prediction models for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using data from sensors monitoring blood glucose concentration demonstrates the superiority of SOM over FNN, WFNN, and LRM with SOM leading to better predictive performance in terms of both mathematical and clinical evaluation criteria."

Yet tighter glycemic control increases the risk of developing hypoglycemia, a sudden drop in patients' blood glucose levels that causes coma and possibly death if proper action is not taken immediately. In this paper, we propose a hypoglycemia prediction model, using recent history of subcutaneous glucose measurements collected via Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors. The model is able to predict hypoglycemia events within a prediction horizon of thirty minutes accurately (sensitivity= 86.47%, specificity= 96.22, accuracy= 95.97%) using only the last two glucose measurements and the difference between them. More remarkably, this study shows the ability to develop a generalized prediction model suitable for predicting hypoglycemia events for the group of patients participating in the study.","This paper proposes a hypoglycemia prediction model, using recent history of subcutaneous glucose measurements collected via Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors, and shows the ability to develop a generalized prediction model suitable for predicting hypoglyCEmia events for the group of patients participating in the study."

Methods: Realistic type 1 diabetes (T1D) models from the literature were combined into a composite system. Using a mixture of “black box” simulations and actual data from diabetic medical histories, realistic sets of diabetic time series were constructed for blood glucose (BG), interstitial fluid glucose, infused insulin, meal estimates, and sometimes plasma insulin assays. The problem of underdetermined parameters was side stepped by applying a variant of a genetic algorithm to partial information, whereby multiple candidate-personalized models were constructed and then rigorously tested using further data. These formed a “dynamic envelope” of trajectories in state space, where each trajectory was generated by a hypothesis on the hidden T1D system dynamics. This dynamic envelope was then culled to a reduced form to cover observed dynamic behavior. A machineintelligent autonomous algorithm then implemented game theory to construct real-time insulin infusion strategies, based on the flow of these trajectories through state space and their interactions with hypoglycemic or near-hyperglycemic states. Results: This technique was tested on 2 simulated participants over a total of fifty-five 24-hour days, with no hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events, despite significant uncertainties from using actual diabetic meal histories with 10-minute warnings. In the main case studies, BG was steered within the desired target set for 99.8% of a 16-hour daily assessment period. Tests confirmed algorithm robustness for ±25% carbohydrate error. For over 99% of the overall 55-day simulation period, either formal controller stability was achieved to the desired target or else the trajectory was within the desired target. Conclusions: These results suggest that this is a stable, high-confidence way to generate closed-loop insulin infusion strategies.","This study demonstrated the novel application of a “machine-intelligent” mathematical structure, combining differential game theory and Lyapunov-based control theory, to the artificial pancreas to handle dynamic uncertainties and suggests that this is a stable, high-confidence way to generate closed-loop insulin infusion strategies."

Time series prediction can be a very useful tool in the field of insulin-dependent diabetes to forecast and to study the behavior of key process parameters in time. Blood glucose (BG) levels prediction provides the possibility to issue early warnings related to ineffective or poor treatments. Consequently, the appropriate responses would allow us to avoid hyper and hypoglycemic events which will improve overall health, safety, and the quality of life of T1D patients. This work concerns with the time series prediction based on grammatical evolution methodologies (GE). The grammar-based feature generation allows to build complex empirical models using a basic knowledge of T1D dynamics. Final solutions involve model adjustment by training with patient specific data. The generated models are able to forecast blood glucose levels and could be used to anticipate hyper or hypoglycemic events 60 minutes in advance.","The grammar-based feature generation allows to build complex empirical models using a basic knowledge of T1D dynamics that are able to forecast blood glucose levels and could be used to anticipate hyper or hypoglycemic events 60 minutes in advance."
