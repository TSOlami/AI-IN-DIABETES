The move from handwritten medical notes to electronic health records and a huge number of digital data commenced in the era of big data in medicine. AI can improve physician performance and help better clinical decision making which is called augmented intelligence. The methods applied in the research of AI and endocrinology include machine learning, artificial neural networks, and natural language processing. Current research in AI technology is making major efforts to improve decision support systems for patient use. One of the best-known applications of AI in endocrinology was seen in diabetes management, which includes prediction, diagnosis of diabetes complications (measuring microalbuminuria, retinopathy), and glycemic control. AI-related technologies are being found to assist in the diagnosis of other endocrine diseases such as thyroid cancer and osteoporosis. This review attempts to provide insight for the development of prospective for AI with a focus on endocrinology. ","In this paper , a review of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis, prediction, and management of diseases in endocrinology is presented, which includes prediction, diagnosis of diabetes complications, and glycemic control."

Even if nations achieve their collective goals, the economic load on the world would not lessen [1]. AI such as machine learning (ML) or deep learning is growing dramatically in many subjects of life and increasing speedily in medical aspects and especially in discovering diseases and medical equipment in diabetes such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with sensors [2]. Noncompliance with suggested treatment has delayed the onset of long-term problems, which can take years. As a result, diabetes management is complex, and therapeutic decisions must consider various medical aspects as well as lifestyle-related activities that must be adjusted to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly expanding area, and its applications to diabetes research are expanding even faster [3]. Diabetes does not affect just the patient but all families as need multidisciplinary care and need health education and follow-up with health-care providers to update the health condition and follow-up from complications so using the ML model will help with health education and suspect complications [4]. Using CGMs helps diabetics patients with type I diabetes to improve control and avoid hypoglycemia occurrence and avoid the frequent bricking of the skin, AI in large diabetic databases that integrate different data sources are rapidly necessitating the use of AI approaches for the creation of applications for therapy personalization and complication prevention [5]. The most challenge in diabetes management and during aerobic exercises is the occurrence of hypoglycemia so the use of AI can be giving promising role in the prevention of hypoglycemia a study by Vehí et al. introduced the patient safety system, an AI-based decision support system for the prediction and prevention of hypoglycemia events and the classification of glycemic control profiles [6]. Time in the range is very important and is considered an eye on controlling blood glucose all day. It collects blood sugar measurements from the CGM every 5 min and analyzes them in real-time using AI algorithms. Incorporating AI into future products successfully will help Medtronic fulfill its aim of employing biomedical engineering to restore health and minimize the management load for individuals with diabetes. Moreover, widen the use of time in the range using AI in CGM devices[5]. Nowadays and after more, many drugs are growing dramatically and will see hundreds of medicines and many anti-diabetic groups and many updated guidelines, and many insulin in the next year’s many groups of medications for diabetes so choosing the best suitable type of patient need more concentration and attention from doctors. Finally, AI may play a very important role in the next years to help doctors to speed up the decision for choosing the right medicines for patients using ML such as the medical history, drug history, contraindications, updated guidelines, A1C, laboratory investigations, type of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia, drug interactions, alarming when blood glucose drop and warning signals, and helping doctors at giving correct decision for fasting for patients at Ramadan and much helpful information. Furthermore, AI helps doctors at the decision at choosing the right type of insulin. Policy-makers must move quickly to equip health and social security institutions to deal with the effects of diabetes, fasten the use of AI in health education and control of diabetes, and improve outcomes using many learning machine models.

Early identification of patients at risk of these microvascular complications using predictive models through machine learning (ML) can be helpful in T1D management. The objective of current review was to systematically identify and summarize published predictive models that used ML to assess the risk of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy in T1D patients.
 Methods: A targeted review of English literature was undertaken in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) from January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. Eligible articles were also identified from cross-references. Following concepts were used in combination to conduct the search queries: diabetes, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, microvascular complication, risk/predictive model, and ML/artificial intelligence/data mining.
 Results: A total of 3,769 hits were found from all sources combined, duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were screened, 61 studies underwent full-text review and a total of six studies met the eligibility criteria. Among them, four studies had developed risk models using data obtained from T1D patients alone, whereas two used data from both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. There was only one study that evaluated all three types of microvascular complications while the other five focused on one individual complication, i.e., either diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. Only two studies evaluated time to developing a complication. The other four studies assessed complications as either binary (yes/no) or categorical (multiple levels). Prediction models were built using cross-sectional data from survey questionnaire (n=1, Iran) and longitudinal data (n=5) which were further classified as sources of electronic medical records (EMR) (n=3, US: 1, Europe: 2), clinical trial (n=1, US) and prospective study (n=1, Europe). Common predictors across studies as well as across types of microvascular complications included age, gender, diabetes duration, BMI, blood pressure, lipid level, and mean or a single HbA1C value. Commonly used ML algorithms included classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF) (CART/RF, n=3), support vector machines (SVMs, n=2), logistic regression (LR, n=2) and neural networks (NNs, n=1). Model performance was evaluated using area under curve (AUC, n=4) and accuracy (n=2). Only half (n=3) of the included studies tested their developed models in an external dataset of patients with T1D. Conclusions: Overall, very few studies reported predictive models for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy using ML specifically for T1D patients. Future research that utilizes contemporary clinical data from T1D patients to predict the three types of microvascular complications is needed.","Overall, very few studies reported predictive models for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy using ML specifically for T1D patients, and future research that utilizes contemporary clinical data from T2D patients to predict the three types of microvascular complications is needed."

An AUC >0.75 indicates clearly useful discrimination performance, while a positive mean relative AUC difference indicates better comparative model performance. Results Of 13 606 articles screened, 32 studies comprising 87 ML models were included. Neural networks (n = 15) were the most frequently utilized. Age, duration of diabetes, and body mass index were common predictors in ML models. Across predicted outcomes, 36% of the models demonstrated clearly useful discrimination. Most ML models reported positive mean relative AUC compared with non-ML methods, with random forest showing the best overall performance for microvascular and macrovascular outcomes. Majority (n = 31) of studies had high risk of bias. Conclusions Random forest was found to have the overall best prediction performance.

This has led to increased interest in using RL to address complex issues in diabetes management. Using RL, a decision maker (or agent) observes decision-making factors (or state) from the dynamic operating environment, selects actions, and subsequently receives delayed rewards. The agent adapts its actions to changes in the operating environment to maximize its cumulative reward and improve system performance. This paper presents how various variants of RL have been used to improve diabetes management, such as a higher time in range during which the blood glucose level is within the normal range and a higher similarity between RL and physician’s policies. Key highlights focus on the application of RL in diabetes management, including a taxonomy of the attributes of RL (e.g., roles and advantages), essential elements for training (e.g., data and simulators), representations of diabetes attributes in RL models, and variants of RL algorithms.

Deep learning algorithms provide a promising avenue for extending simulator capabilities; however, these algorithms are limited in that they do not necessarily learn physiologically correct glucose dynamics and can learn incorrect and potentially dangerous relationships from confounders in training data. This is likely to be more important in real-world scenarios, as data is not collected under strict research protocol. This work explores the implications of using deep learning algorithms trained on real-world data to model glucose dynamics. Free-living data was processed from the OpenAPS Data Commons and supplemented with patient-reported tags of challenging diabetes events, constituting one of the most detailed real-world T1D datasets. This dataset was used to train and evaluate state-of-the-art glucose simulators, comparing their prediction error across safety critical scenarios and assessing the physiological appropriateness of the learned dynamics using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). While deep learning prediction accuracy surpassed the widely-used mathematical simulator approach, the model deteriorated in safety critical scenarios and struggled to leverage self-reported meal and exercise information. SHAP value analysis also indicated the model had fundamentally confused the roles of insulin and carbohydrates, which is one of the most basic T1D management principles. This work highlights the importance of considering physiological appropriateness when using deep learning to model real-world systems in T1D and healthcare more broadly, and provides recommendations for building models that are robust to real-world data constraints.","While deep learning prediction accuracy surpassed the widely-used mathematical simulator approach, the model deteriorated in safety critical scenarios and struggled to leverage self-reported meal and exercise information, and provides recommendations for building models that are robust to real-world data constraints."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health concern among children with the widespread adoption of advanced technologies. However, concerns are growing about the transparency, replicability, biasedness, and overall validity of artificial intelligence studies in medicine.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to systematically review the reporting quality of machine learning (ML) studies of pediatric DM using the Minimum Information About Clinical Artificial Intelligence Modelling (MI-CLAIM) checklist, a general reporting guideline for medical artificial intelligence studies.


METHODS
We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from 2016 to 2020. Studies were included if the use of ML was reported in children with DM aged 2 to 18 years, including studies on complications, screening studies, and in silico samples. In studies following the ML workflow of training, validation, and testing of results, reporting quality was assessed via MI-CLAIM by consensus judgments of independent reviewer pairs. Positive answers to the 17 binary items regarding sufficient reporting were qualitatively summarized and counted as a proxy measure of reporting quality. The synthesis of results included testing the association of reporting quality with publication and data type, participants (human or in silico), research goals, level of code sharing, and the scientific field of publication (medical or engineering), as well as with expert judgments of clinical impact and reproducibility.


RESULTS
After screening 1043 records, 28 studies were included. The sample size of the training cohort ranged from 5 to 561. Six studies featured only in silico patients. The reporting quality was low, with great variation among the 21 studies assessed using MI-CLAIM. The number of items with sufficient reporting ranged from 4 to 12 (mean 7.43, SD 2.62). The items on research questions and data characterization were reported adequately most often, whereas items on patient characteristics and model examination were reported adequately least often. The representativeness of the training and test cohorts to real-world settings and the adequacy of model performance evaluation were the most difficult to judge. Reporting quality improved over time (r=0.50; P=.02); it was higher than average in prognostic biomarker and risk factor studies (P=.04) and lower in noninvasive hypoglycemia detection studies (P=.006), higher in studies published in medical versus engineering journals (P=.004), and higher in studies sharing any code of the ML pipeline versus not sharing (P=.003). The association between expert judgments and MI-CLAIM ratings was not significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The reporting quality of ML studies in the pediatric population with DM was generally low. Important details for clinicians, such as patient characteristics; comparison with the state-of-the-art solution; and model examination for valid, unbiased, and robust results, were often the weak points of reporting. To assess their clinical utility, the reporting standards of ML studies must evolve, and algorithms for this challenging population must become more transparent and replicable.","The reporting quality of ML studies in the pediatric population with DM was generally low, with great variation among the 21 studies assessed using MI-CLAIM, a general reporting guideline for medical artificial intelligence studies."

Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL ( p &lt; 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support.

DM impacted 463 million individuals worldwide in 2019, with over four million fatalities documented. Blood glucose levels (BGL) are usually measured, as standard protocols, through invasive procedures. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques have demonstrated the potential to estimate BGL using data collected by non-invasive Wearable Devices (WDs), thereby, facilitating monitoring and management of diabetics. One of the key aspects of WDs with machine learning (ML) algorithms is to find specific data signatures, called Digital biomarkers, that can be used in classification or gaging the extent of the underlying condition. The use of such biomarkers to monitor glycemic events represents a major shift in technology for self-monitoring and developing digital biomarkers using non-invasive WDs. To do this, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between characteristics acquired from non-invasive WDs and indicators of glycemic health; furthermore, much work is needed to validate accuracy. The study aimed to investigate performance of AI models in estimating BGL among diabetic patients using non-invasive wearable devices data An open-source dataset was used which provided BGL readings, diabetic status (Diabetic or non-diabetic), heart rate, Blood oxygen level (SPO2), Diastolic Blood pressure, Systolic Blood Pressure, Body temperature, Sweating, and Shivering for 13 participants by age group taken from WDs. Our experimental design included Data Collection, Feature Engineering, ML model selection/development, and reporting evaluation of metrics. We were able to estimate with high accuracy (RMSE range: 0.099 to 0.197) the relationship between glycemic metrics and features that can be derived from non-invasive WDs when utilizing AI models. We provide further evidence of the feasibility of using commercially available WDs for the purpose of BGL estimation amongst diabetics.

Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020. Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners—which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions—frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and “deep learning” can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons.

Here, to bridge the gaps, we developed an integrated image–language system (DeepDR-LLM), combining a large language model (LLM module) and image-based deep learning (DeepDR-Transformer), to provide individualized diabetes management recommendations to PCPs. In a retrospective evaluation, the LLM module demonstrated comparable performance to PCPs and endocrinology residents when tested in English and outperformed PCPs and had comparable performance to endocrinology residents in Chinese. For identifying referable DR, the average PCP’s accuracy was 81.0% unassisted and 92.3% assisted by DeepDR-Transformer. Furthermore, we performed a single-center real-world prospective study, deploying DeepDR-LLM. We compared diabetes management adherence of patients under the unassisted PCP arm ( n = 397) with those under the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm ( n = 372). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm showed better self-management behaviors throughout follow-up ( P &lt; 0.05). For patients with referral DR, those in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm were more likely to adhere to DR referrals ( P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, DeepDR-LLM deployment improved the quality and empathy level of management recommendations. Given its multifaceted performance, DeepDR-LLM holds promise as a digital solution for enhancing primary diabetes care and DR screening.

Digital health takes into account the ever-increasing synergy between advanced medical technologies, innovation, and digital communication. Thanks to machine learning, we are not limited anymore to a descriptive analysis of the data, as we can obtain greater value by identifying and predicting patterns resulting from inductive reasoning. Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for ""what-if"" models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability. In this context, new digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are certainly a great opportunity. Herein, we report the results of a careful analysis of the current literature and represent the vision of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD) on this controversial topic that, if well used, may be the key for a great scientific innovation. AMD believes that the use of artificial intelligence will enable the conversion of data (descriptive) into knowledge of the factors that ""affect"" the behavior and correlations (predictive), thereby identifying the key aspects that may establish an improvement of the expected results (prescriptive). Artificial intelligence can therefore become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine. This, in turn, will allow for comprehensive therapies to be built in accordance with the evidence criteria that should always be the ground for any therapeutic choice.","Artificial intelligence can become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine."

Artificial intelligence (AI), a swiftly expanding discipline, holds substantial potential to transform current practices in diabetes diagnosis and management. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of contemporary research investigating drug responses in patient subgroups, stratified via either supervised or unsupervised machine learning approaches. The prevalent algorithmic workflow for investigating drug responses using machine learning involves cohort selection, data processing, predictor selection, development and validation of machine learning methods, subgroup allocation, and subsequent analysis of drug response. Despite the promising feature, current research does not yet provide sufficient evidence to implement machine learning algorithms into routine clinical practice, due to a lack of simplicity, validation, or demonstrated efficacy. Nevertheless, we anticipate that the evolving evidence base will increasingly substantiate the role of machine learning in molding precision pharmacotherapy for diabetes.

This exploratory study uses machine learning on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to identify factors influencing DR and predict high-risk individuals for timely intervention. Methods: Between June 2018 and March 2022, adults with T1D with incident DR or no retinopathy (control) were identified. The CGM data were collected retrospectively for up to seven years before the date of defining incident DR or no retinopathy. A mixture of three machine learning algorithms was trained and evaluated in two different scenarios, using different glycemic features extracted from CGM traces (scenario 1), and the two principal components (two PCs; exposure to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia risk) of those features (scenario 2). Classifiers were evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC) to select the best classification model. Results: The CGM data of 30 adults with incident DR (mean±SD age of 21.2±9.4 years, glycated hemoglobin [HbA 1c ] of 8.6%±1.0%, and body mass index [BMI] of 24.5±4.8 kg/m 2 ) and 30 adults without DR (age of 41.8±14.7 years, HbA 1c of 7.0%±0.9%, and BMI of 26.2±3.6 kg/m 2 ) were included in this analysis. In scenario 2, classifiers outperformed scenario 1, resulting in an average AUC-ROC increase to 0.92 for two of three models, indicating that the two PCs captured vital classification data, representing the most discriminative aspects and enhancing model performance. Conclusion: Machine learning approaches using CGM data may have potential to aid in identifying adults with T1D at risk of DR.

AI applications have the potential to revolutionize diabetic care by assisting millions of people with diabetes in achieving better blood glucose management, reducing hyperglycemic episodes, and lowering diabetic morbidity and complications. We can see the evolution of closed-loop insulin delivery systems with inbuilt AI algorithms to safeguard both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in Type 1 diabetes, which have been relatively few attempts in management techniques for diabetes excursions. The medication you choose and how much you take depend on a variety of factors, including your body mass index, which influences beta-cell activity and insulin resistance, among other things.

Poorly managed diabetes can lead to serious and life-threatening health complications. A person’s glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C or A1C) measures the average blood glucose for the past 2–3 months by measuring how much glucose is bound to the hemoglobin cells in the blood. The HbA1C is used both to diagnose diabetes and assess the effectiveness of a person’s management plan. Developing a model that can accurately predict a person’s future HbA1C 2–3 months in advance holds immense potential for preventative and tailored medical care. With the new era of artificial intelligence (AI) it becomes increasing evident that some of unanswered health issues can be unlocked by leveraging on advanced AI and machine learning algorithms. In addition, sudden plummeted or elevated blood glucose levels also pose serious and life-threating consequences to diabetic people. The development of a detection and prediction model capable of detecting or predicting instances of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia using new CGM technology is critical. This chapter discusses the consequences of poorly managed diabetes and how a more personalized treatment plan for diabetes may lie in the detection of hyper/hypoglycemic events and the prediction of a person’s HbA1C using their current blood glucose values.","The consequences of poorly managed diabetes are discussed and how a more personalized treatment plan for diabetes may lie in the detection of hyper/hypoglycemic events and the prediction of a person’s HbA1C using their current blood glucose values."

The six technologies which have the potential to transform diabetes care are (i) telehealth, (ii) incorporation of diabetes digital data into the electronic health record, (iii) qualitative hypoglycemia alarms, (iv) artificial intelligence, (v) cybersecurity of diabetes devices, and (vi) diabetes registries. To be successful, a new digital health technology must be accessible and affordable. Furthermore, the people and communities that would most likely benefit from the technology must be willing to use the innovation in their management of diabetes.","In this article, the authors highlight six areas of innovation that have the potential to reduce the burden of diabetes for individuals living with the condition and their families as well as provide measurable benefits for all stakeholders involved in diabetes care."

Ole K. Hejlesen","10.1177/1932296815611680","","Diabetes is one of the top priorities in medical science and health care management, and an abundance of data and information is available on these patients. Whether data stem from statistical models or complex pattern recognition models, they may be fused into predictive models that combine patient information and prognostic outcome results. Such knowledge could be used in clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and public health management to improve patient care. Our aim was to review the literature and give an introduction to predictive models in screening for and the management of prevalent short- and long-term complications in diabetes. Predictive models have been developed for management of diabetes and its complications, and the number of publications on such models has been growing over the past decade. Often multiple logistic or a similar linear regression is used for prediction model development, possibly owing to its transparent functionality. Ultimately, for prediction models to prove useful, they must demonstrate impact, namely, their use must generate better patient outcomes. Although extensive effort has been put in to building these predictive models, there is a remarkable scarcity of impact studies.","The aim was to review the literature and give an introduction to predictive models in screening for and the management of prevalent short- and long-term complications in diabetes."

One small study suggested that a deep learning model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network had better performance in hypoglycemia prediction than traditional machine learning algorithms in European patients with type 1 diabetes. However, given that many well-recognized deep learning models perform poorly outside the training setting, it remains unclear whether the LSTM model could be generalized to different populations or patients with other diabetes subtypes. ","Generalization of a deep learning model for continuous glucose monitoring–Based hypoglycemia prediction is needed to assess its applicability to different populations and patients with other diabetes subtypes."

Georgiou","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181448","","Deep learning models have achieved the state of the art in blood glucose (BG) prediction, which has been shown to improve type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. However, most existing models can only provide single-horizon prediction and face a variety of real-world challenges, such as lacking hardware implementation and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a new deep learning framework, the edge-based temporal fusion Transformer (E-TFT), for multi-horizon BG prediction, and implement the trained model on a customized wristband with a system on a chip (Nordic nRF52832) for edge computing. E-TFT employs a self-attention mechanism to extract long-term temporal dependencies and enables post-hoc explanation for feature selection. On a clinical dataset with 12 T1D subjects, it achieved a mean root mean square error of 19.09 ± 2.47 mg/dL and 32.31 ± 3.79 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, and outperformed all the considered baseline methods, such as N-BEATS and N-HiTS. The proposed model is effective for multi-horizon BG prediction and can be deployed on wearable devices to enhance T1D management in clinical settings.","Wang et al. as mentioned in this paper proposed an edge-based temporal fusion transformer (E-TFT), which employs a self-attention mechanism to extract long-term temporal dependencies and enables post-hoc explanation for feature selection."

There is a need to understand the variation in treatment response to these drugs to be able to predict people who will respond well or poorly to a drug. Electronic health records, clinical trials, and observational studies provide a huge amount of data to explore predictors of drug response. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, has the capacity to improve the prediction of treatment response in patients. AI can assist in the analysis of vast datasets to identify patterns and may provide valuable information on selecting an effective drug. Predicting an individual’s response to a drug can aid in treatment selection, optimizing therapy, exploring new therapeutic options, and personalised medicine. This review reveals a consensus on the potential of AI-based methods to predict drug response with accuracy. Furthermore, the methods highlight a trend toward using ensemble methods as preferred models in drug response prediction studies. </sec> ","This preprint explores the application of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to predict individual responses to glucose-lowering drugs for Type 2 Diabetes, leveraging electronic health records and clinical data for personalized treatment selection."

D. Shanmuga Priyaa","","","Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder where the body fails to produce the digestive hormone insulin, or the body’s ability to respond to insulin is limited. This situation leads to abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated blood sugar level. Type-1 diabetes (T1DM) is a condition arises mainly due to auto immunity disorder in which the immunity cells of the body mistakenly destroy the beta cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin. T1DM patients require to have proper control of their blood glucose level through proper medication, physical activities and continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels. A wide range of advanced wellbeing innovations, particularly computerized applications, have been growing quickly to assist individuals with dealing with their diabetes. Artificial Intelligence is a rapidly growing field, and its applications to diabetes research are becoming significantly more quickly. This paper is a review of six studies of existing neural network-based models for the prediction of future blood glucose level in T1DM patients and describes some challenges to predict future blood glucose with the available data. These models include prediction of blood glucose level using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN) Feedforward Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, Bidirectional LSTM, Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks","This paper is a review of six studies of existing neural network-based models for the prediction of future blood glucose level in T1DM patients and describes some challenges to predict futureBlood glucose with the available data."
