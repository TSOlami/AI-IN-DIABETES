 there will be 134 Million diabetics in India by 2045 as per IDF. Also, the disease
 burden is increasing to the young population between ages 25-40 as more of them are
 diagnosed positive according to JAMA recently. Moreover, there are only 4.8 Doctors per
 10,000 population, and in villages, the ratio is the lowest possible in this country,
 according to the Indian Journal of Public Health. Therefore, screening & predicting
 Diabetes at an early stage remains a priority for clinicians. It reduces the risk of
 major complications and improves patients' quality of life with diabetes, and builds
 resilience and well-being amongst other citizens. With the advancement of Computer
 Science & Artificial Intelligence, it is now possible to predict diabetes and other
 such diseases through applying deep learning algorithms in high-quality data sets. This
 helps in a more accurate and faster diagnosis of Pre-diabetes, Diabetes &
 diabetes-related progressive eye diseases. In this study, a systematic review of the
 Pubmed repository for current practices to diagnose Diabetes based on AI intervention in
 the Indian context is carried out. Also, a critical analysis was done on various
 pioneered companies currently offering AI-based Diabetes diagnostic services in India.
 The study represents different concepts of AI tools used to predict the diseases
 currently available in India. Although most of the studies were carried out on Diabetic
 Retinopathy screening, future opportunities can be in several other areas such as
 Clinical Decision Support, Predictive Population Risk Stratification and Patient
 Self-Management Tools.","limited. The rapid extension of medical expertise compounds the complexities of real-time information on diabetes treatment. Rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI) offer the promise of making accessible for the treatment of PWDs both real-time structured and unstructured health data. Background:
 The Turing Archive defines AI for the History of Computing as "" the science of making computers do things that require intelligence when done by humans."" AI covers a wide range of approaches to simulating human intelligence and performing different tasks of reasoning, such as visual perception, recognition of speech, analytics, decision-making, and language translation. The scope of AI methods is used by cognitive systems to expand and scale human awareness and expertise by allowing humans to easily exploit large sources of knowledge to solve problems. Today, in order to meet customer demand in every sector, including health care, AI uses vast quantities of vital information. Background:
 A 2017 study found that 68 percent of developers and publishers of mobile health apps agree that diabetes continues to be the single most significant area of health care with the greatest business potential for digital health solutions in the near future and that 61 percent see AI as the most disruptive technology shaping the digital health sector. This paper aims to better understand what important AI developments can be applicable to PWDs, their primary care clinicians today. Method:
 The study team conducted a predefined, online PubMed search of publicly available sources of information using the search terms ''diabetes'' and ''artificial intelligence (AI).'' To identify articles with clinically relevant, high-impact diabetes AI applications, the team excluded manuscripts with publication dates before 2010 and those whose purpose was primarily technical in nature (e.g., focused solely on AI algorithm development). The first-pass search identified a total of 20 clinically relevant abstracts. The additional review excluded 9 as duplicative or primarily technical. The second-pass review yielded a total of 11 unique, clinically relevant articles researching the direct application of AI in diabetes prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The information was then collated and classified. The research was conducted between Dec 2020 and Feb of 2021. Results:
 A total of 11 clinically important and high-impact articles published related to the field of applied AI in diabetes care were obtained from the PubMed search. The goal of the AI applications was to enhance a wide range of diabetes care, from diabetes screening and diagnosis to monitoring and treatment, including applications, devices, and systems to support patients, clinicians, and health systems. The published papers included in this search were of high clinical impact in that they aimed to establish and evaluate AI approaches that could have a major impact on diabetes treatment in the areas of access, precision, quality, affordability, speed, and patient, clinician, and caregiver satisfaction. An analysis of the high-impact papers indicates that AI applications seek to turn diabetes treatment into four main areas: automated retinal screening, support for clinical decision-making, stratification of predictive population risk, and tools for patient self-management, as outlined in Table . In these studies, a diverse and complex collection of AI methods and cognitive computing systems were employed. The more popular AI approaches mentioned in the research are specified in Table , and their clinical applications in diabetes care are listed."

The alarming increase in diabetes calls for the need to take precautionary measures to avoid/predict the occurrence of diabetes. This paper proposes HealthEdge, a machine learning-based smart healthcare framework for type 2 diabetes prediction in an integrated IoT-edge-cloud computing system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out between the two most used machine learning algorithms in the literature, Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR), using two real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that RF predicts diabetes with 6% more accuracy on average compared to LR. ","Section 5 concludes the paper with future research directions. summarizes the works on machine learning-based stand-alone diabetes prediction. None of these works propose a framework for diabetes prediction in an integrated IoT-edge-cloud computing system. In this paper, we address this gap. HealthEdge: Machine Learning-based Smart Healthcare Framework for Predicting Type 2 Diabetes in an Integrated IoT-Edge-Cloud Computing System:
 Fig.  shows our proposed HealthEdge system in an integrated IoT-edge-cloud computing system. The IoT devices and sensors are used to collect diabetes risk factors data for the user. Different sensors and medical devices are used to measure the values of heart rate, hypertension, obesity, sleep duration, glucose, cholesterol level, physical activity, and serum uric acid. Considering the limited computing capabilities of these low -powered IoT devices, the collected data is sent to the edge servers for transformation via a mobile application. Edge servers transform the data into a proper structure consisting of time stamps, patient/user ID, and risk factors values. The transformed data is sent to the cloud  for machine learning model development. The data is first preprocessed to remove missing values using Algorithm 1. The preprocessed data is used for hyperparameter tuning (Algorithm 2) to find the optimal parameters and train a machine learning model. These values are then used to create a prediction model. Algorithm 3 presents the pseudocode for model building and validation. The developed model is then used by edge servers for predicting type 2 diabetes. Fig.  shows the test setup for HealthEdge."

Providers must integrate these codes into revenue cycle operations. Training clinical staff (nurses and mid-level providers) to check incoming data from patients and escalate decision making to a physician, as needed, is another important step. Diabetes management:
 Wearable continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and lash glucose monitoring devices (a wearable sensor and smartphone/reader to scan the sensor), including the DEXCOM G5/G6 and the Freestyle Libre Sensor, promise to revolutionize diabetes management. These devices enable tight glycemic control while minimizing hyperand hypoglycemic episodes, which can result in improved HbA1c and ""time in-control"" for patients with both type I and type II diabetes . Patients using approved CGMs can self-adjust insulin doses without con irming results with capillary glucose ( ingerstick) readings . The FDA evaluated data from 2 clinical studies including 324 adults and children in which DEXCOM G6 readings were compared against laboratory measurements of blood glucose, and found no serious adverse events . Several landmark trials have demonstrated the ef icacy of CGM technology in patients requiring multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) , continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) , and in patients with hypoglycemic unawareness . In the future, we expect machine learning and robust arti icial intelligence (AI) will assist with this type of analysis. One emerging example is the ""applied health signals engine"" from Livongo . CGM systems are now being deployed in closed-loop con igurations with CSII; the Medtronic Minimed 670G system approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on the market . Others are likely to soon follow. mHealth technologies will enable providers to partner with patients with diabetes, such as adjusting treatment regimens via the patient's mobile device. AI software can ef iciently evaluate patient-generated health data from mHealth tools, along with lab results (e.g., glucose levels, renal function, HbA1c, and lipid pro iles) and eye exam to continuously monitor patients' progress. Patients needing more intensive intervention can meet with a certi ied diabetes educator or have a scheduled clinic visit. These technologies allow for implementation of population health goals, and makes patient management truly time-and place-independent. Diabetes management:
 Recommendations for practice readiness, similar to those for weight management, include additional emphasis on integrating home glucose monitoring data into sections of the electronic record where clinicians can easily view patients' relevant lab data. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) management:
 This chronic condition consumes signi icant healthcare resources and is associated with repeated ER visits and hospitalizations, and high rates of readmission. In the United States, CHF is one of the Medicare readmission penalty diseases; the average cost of a single hospitalization for a Medicare recipient is $14,631, with a median length-of-stay of ive days . Data demonstrate that 40.2% of Medicare patients with CHF are readmitted within 90 days of a prior hospital discharge ."

Data sources included (1) observations during app testing and (2) survey responses on desired app features. Guided by the SDT, coding categories included app functions that could address psychological needs for motivation in self-management: competence, autonomy, and connectivity. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Patients described design features that addressed needs for &lt;i&gt;competence, autonomy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;connectivity&lt;/i&gt;. To promote &lt;i&gt;competence&lt;/i&gt;, electronic data recording and analysis should help patients track and understand blood glucose (BG) results necessary for planning behavior changes. To promote &lt;i&gt;autonomy&lt;/i&gt;, BG trend analysis should empower patients to set safe and practical personalized behavioral goals based on time and the day of the week. To promote &lt;i&gt;connectivity&lt;/i&gt;, app email or messaging function could share data reports and communicate with others on self-management advice. Additional themes that emerged are the top general app designs to promote positive user experience: patient-friendly; automatic features of data upload; voice recognition to eliminate typing data; alert or reminder on self-management activities; and app interactivity of a sound, message, or emoji change in response to keeping or not keeping BG in the target range. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> The application of the SDT was useful in identifying motivational app designs that address the psychological needs of &lt;i&gt;competence&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;autonomy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;connectivity&lt;/i&gt;. User-centered design concepts, such as being patient-friendly, differ from the SDT because patients need a positive user experience (ie, a technology need). Patients want engaging diabetes apps that go beyond data input and output. Apps should be easy to use, provide personalized analysis reports, be interactive to affirm positive behaviors, facilitate data sharing, and support patient-clinician communication. </sec> ","such as being patient-friendly and requiring minimal user effort, are also important. Continued efforts are needed to understand long-term adoption of diabetes apps to support self-management by patients, as well as the integration of diabetes apps in the telehealth setting for clinicians.

It refers to systems that demonstrate intelligent behavior, such as the ability to analyze their environment to take action that is typically displayed by humans and animals.  AI-embedded devices possess the ability to learn through example scenarios and past data presented to the system. The word AI was first introduced to the research community in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College in the United States [1].  With time, the AI industry expanded from data to information, then to knowledge, and ultimately to intelligence. Due to the depth and breadth of learning capacity associated with AI technologies, today it has become one of the hottest research areas, finding applications in but not limited to computer vision, marketing, industrial automation, big data, and the Internet of things (IOT).","platforms can be used at remote or low-resource locations to act in place of human experts, if one is not readily available. For instance, in Nigeria, mobile phone recordings of an infant's cry are used successfully to predict possible birth asphyxia . Challenges and Risks:
 As mentioned earlier, AI in healthcare utilises an artificial narrow intelligence approach. Hence for successful implementation of AI techniques in healthcare, it is essential to clearly identify a specific problem with a specific solution. Further, up-to-date field data is an essential component when it comes to AI systems. Data collection, privacy preservation, data interpretation, and model updating at regular intervals play a key role in the successful deployment of these AI technologies. For instance, the effectiveness of AI-based scheduling applications depends highly on an updated accurate large quantity of data. If the data is outdated, the predicted outcome and the planned schedules, would not carry any meaningful information. Another key challenge faced by AI technology at deployment is the maintenance of trust with the clients. Accuracy tracking mechanisms of these expert systems may assist to build the trust between clinicians and patients when it comes to the exactness of the system output. IT infrastructure of the developing nations and the IT literacy of the health sector employers also affect the deployment of these technologies. In some instances, new facilities need to be built, and officers need to be trained to manage and maintain the expert systems. AI-based healthcare, unfortunately, comes with a risk as well. System error or algorithmic error can outperform the advantages. Hence it is essential to have regular, maintenance checks. Moreover, for the safer side, it is better to have AI-based health care as a complementary system that works hand in hand with the human expert. Challenges and Risks:
 In conclusion, AI holds a remarkable potential to transform healthcare sectors in the developing world. The difficulties faced by developing countries due to a lack of specialised services, and resource limitations can be tackled using AI-enabled tools. Routine preventive service planning, scheduling, and execution can be effectively managed by coherently analysing past data and predicting patterns. Successful expert systems can be carefully designed using readily available electronic devices, such as mobile phones with access to cloud processing to strengthen disease detection and prevention in resource-poor settings. However, effective deployment of these services would require a good understanding of the social, economic, and political context of the local community. Further research into AI in resource-poor environments, would facilitate an archive of sustainable development in healthcare sectors in developing countries."

It is the most prevalent disease that significantly impacts the population. Although there are numerous possible causes of diabetes, age, excessive body fat, frailty, fast weight loss, and many other conditions are the ones that occur most often. Diabetes patients are more susceptible to developing a number of diseases, including heart disease, kidney issues, damaged nerves, damaged blood vessels, and blindness. It is challenging to diagnose the ailment, and it is both costly and difficult to anticipate how it will develop. Machine learning (ML) offers tremendous potential to develop useful applications for earlier detection, diagnosis, and therapy, as well as the treatment of many disorders, which is why medical experts are particularly interested in it. This study aims to develop a model that can reliably and precisely identify diabetes. Following that, association rule mining was employed to find the common indications of diabetic symptoms. This study also presents a useful model for diabetes prediction that makes use of various machine-learning approaches to improve diabetes categorization and increase the precision of diabetes prediction. Machine learning methods utilized in the early stage diabetes prediction include Gaussian Naive Bayes, ExtraTreesClassifier, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The choice of the dataset's major attribute was then made after considering a total of six different ways. Then, a total of 10 alternative models utilized for early-stage diabetes prediction were applied to the previously selected and highlighted dataset. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure are some of the metrics used to evaluate the various performance levels of these models. The performance matrices show that the ExtraTreesClassifier performed at the maximum level possible, earning a perfect score in each area with accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score of 100%. Therefore, we can assert that the performance of our ExtraTreesClassifier model is superior to that of the already available work.

 Hyperglycemia is a hallmark of the clinical illness known as diabetes mellitus, which has multiple etiologies (mellitus being Latin for sweet). About 90% of those with diabetes have type 2, with the rest having type 1. Diabetes affects more than 422 million people globally, most of whom live in low-and middle-income countries. By keeping a healthy weight and managing blood sugar levels, diabetes can be avoided. An estimated 1.5 million individuals die from diabetes directly each year throughout the world. Throughout the recent past, there has been a continuous rise in both the overall prevalence of diabetes and the number of instances of the condition. . Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body burns food for energy. Your body converts the bulk of the food you consume into sugar (glucose), which is subsequently absorbed into your circulation. In reaction to a rise in blood sugar levels, the pancreas secretes insulin. In the presence of insulin, blood sugar can enter cells and be utilized as a source of energy. Insufficient or improper insulin usage by the body can result in diabetes. When there is insufficient insulin or when cells stop responding to insulin, quite so much blood sugar is left in the circulation. It may be followed by serious health problems like heart disease, kidney failure, and vision loss. More people are served by global health systems. Many deadly diseases impact people worldwide. Diabetes causes heart attacks, kidney failure, blindness, and other major health issues. Every hospital tracks illnesses. IT has transformed health care. Each machine-learning algorithm enhances disease prediction and healthcare automation. Hadoop, built on computer clusters, efficiently analyzes and stores massive datasets in the cloud. This work  suggests forecasting diabetes with Hadoop-based machine learning. The results imply machine-learning algorithms can accurately forecast diabetes. The effectiveness of the algorithm is investigated using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Disorders. A cutting-edge computing healthcare system is one of the most investigated topics in healthcare research. Computing and healthcare researchers collaborate to advance such systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) found an increase in diabetic patients and deaths. Diabetes can have long-term effects. Medical research is expanding. Technological advances and continual monitoring are needed to collect, preserve, study, and forecast such individuals' health. India's rising diabetic population is worrying. A system that records, analyzes, and searches for diabetic risks using technology is essential. Researchers are developing early detection and analysis methods.

"Networking Architecture and Key Supporting Technologies for Human
  Digital Twin in Personalized Healthcare: A Comprehensive Survey","https://scispace.com/paper/networking-architecture-and-key-supporting-technologies-for-3rkjt921","2023","Posted Content","","","10.48550/arxiv.2301.03930","https://scispace.com/pdf/networking-architecture-and-key-supporting-technologies-for-3rkjt921.pdf","Digital twin (DT), refers to a promising technique to digitally and accurately represent actual physical entities. One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system's detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict future behaviour, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT.

Background and Motivation:
 T HE inherent shortage of healthcare resources has caused ongoing challenges to the traditional healthcare system. For example, COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2023 has resulted in surges of demands for medical facilities, such as ventilators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and testing machines, which exceeds the capacity of the traditional system, leading to tens of millions of people infected and died . Meanwhile, the cost burden on the traditional healthcare system is rapidly growing in most worldwide regions. For instance, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predicts that U.S. healthcare spending will grow at a rate 1.1% faster than that of the annual gross domestic product (GDP) and is expected to increase from 17.7% of the GDP in 2018 to .7% (reach to $6.2 trillion) by 2028 . Despite healthcare expenditures being projected to increase at such a substantial rate, the traditional healthcare system produces no better (and indeed sometimes worse) outcomes. A recent analysis estimated that about one-quarter of total healthcare spending in the U.S. (between $760 billion and $935 billion annually) is wasteful, mainly attributed to ineffective and inefficient treatments . A. Background and Motivation:
 To this end, the relentless proliferation of disruptive information technologies, such as 5G, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), have open rich opportunities for the realization of highly efficient personalized healthcare (PH) services. PH is an innovative way that seeks to offer preventive care and targeted treatments for each individual patient through his/her unique medical records, genes and values. In other words, PH can provide a more precise treatment approach, onesize-fits-one approach, eliminating unnecessary side effects and high cost of one-size-fits-all approach widely adopted in the traditional healthcare system. Furthermore, PH can also help medical personnel make better decisions and facilitate breakthroughs for many difficult-to-treat rare diseases given the individualized data-driven information, thereby improve the quality of life of people around the world . A. Background and Motivation:
 Unsurprisingly, AI plays a prominent role in the implementation of PH. As one of the most popular research hotspots, AI has penetrated in all aspects of people's lives with strong muscle in data analysis. AI can fuel the progress of digitization and intelligence of all industries, particularly for healthcare, where AI emulates human cognition in the analysis of compli-cated medical data using complex algorithms and software. To guarantee superior PH services, AI requires accurate learning and construction of many high-performance and personalized feature models for individuals, based on massive high-quality individual training datasets . Nevertheless, this process of acquiring individual datasets from a single person (particularly for supervised learning which needs to manually label these datasets) is significantly costly, error-prone and timeconsuming. Furthermore, the existing AI-driven efforts mostly provide solutions through regression-based and classificationbased approaches for real-valued and discrete-valued attributes predictions respectively, and thereby, such solutions are limited in scope to specific diseases, diagnosis or a small subset of the population ."

Even though there are millions of medical facilities worldwide, it is challenging to attend to each and every patient, primarily those with diseases like Covid-19 and Hepatitis B. It is practically impossible to monitor the conditions of those patients due to a concern of infection. Without quality monitoring, it is impossible to keep track of patients' conditions. To improve patient care, the present invention discloses the design and development of a reliable and consistent patient monitoring system that allows medical professionals to monitor their patients while they are either in a hospital or at home.","real time glucose level and due to that there can be delay in treatment of diseases like hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in patients. : It also consumes energy and thus it also needs to be charged after a certain period. E. Comprehensive Explanation of Project:
 The main goal of the system's initial testing was to verify that the system could perform autonomously to the patient's bedside, capture the patient's body vitals and save that information in its cloud server, and then report to the doctor with the information. The mobile health monitoring system will be given a number of upgrades, though. The system will have wireless capability so that patient data can be wirelessly transferred to the doctor's PC without the doctor having to remove the SD card in order to access the data. When urgent health care is required, this might speed up the doctor's response time. In order to improve communication between the system and patients and to ensure accurate readings, the system will also be given some speech capabilities. System-patient interaction should be the same as that between a doctor and patient because the ultimate goal is to have a system with human abilities that can help medical staff in a hospital setting. More sensors and other devices will be added in order to gather more thorough medical data on the patient. The mobile health monitoring system can currently only detect and measure common vitals. In order to provide a visual inspection of the patient, a video camera will also be integrated into the system. The automated health monitoring system will undergo additional testing inside of a hospital since that is where it is intended to be used. The information and timing columns also include information about the patient and data timing. The data collected is then saved on the cloud server. Thus, a complete record of each patient's medical history is kept, which can be used for better remote healthcare and diagnosis. IV. CONCLUSION:
 IoT has many uses in a wide range of fields. Any remote tracking system, -in particular those utilized in the field of health monitoring systems, may benefit from the use of the Internet of Things. Besides that, it gives an overview, analysis, and methods for the Health Monitoring system using IOT process, as well as numerous software and hardware components. These applications produce a significant amount of sensor data that must be effectively monitored and handled. The distinct framework offered can be used to manage patient-specific network and cloud device data. IoT has the potential to improve the healthcare system. Regardless of the numerous obstacles to IoT in healthcare, there is always a way to navigate around them."

Large scale data efforts are increasingly being undertaken in response to the advent of Personalized and Precision Medicine and in association with both the “omics revolution” and the Electronic Health Records centrality. big data have demonstrated that their complex characteristics bring both strength factors and bottlenecks to research problems widely identified, analyzed and reviewed across many sectors of medicine and public health. As the most significant feature of big data is “variety”, and this implies heterogeneity, our knowledge in complex disease contexts may substantially benefit from the fusion of different data types when a major role is assigned to harmonization and interoperability strategies. We discuss of an example, diabetes.","learning to assign statistical significance to data processed by machine learning techniques (say, blockchains in health, considering that more than 40% of healthcare organizations believe that interoperability of EHR will accelerate blockchain implementation, according to an Hyperledger's survey). Use case: big data standardization:
 We recall    . By promoting EHR interoperability, ONC identified 4 areas causing variation in measurement standards: (I) architecture, say cloud vs. client-based for instance (II) development level, say granularity depth regarding measurement (III) data access (end user friendly) and (IV) variability in the way a standard is used. Use case: diabetes:
 Below, a short list of prioritized aspects relevant to developments and advances in this field. Diabetes registries:
 Encourage establishment of minimum standards for each center to create a diabetes patient registry such that deidentified data can be collected for existing or new registries. EHR:
 Facilitate effective and efficient use in diabetes and ordering systems by sharing creative solutions, protocols, and order sets among members to make best use of currently-existing EHR systems. Provide representation as a single voice to request specific EHR improvements that impact diabetes care. Standards:
 Agreement on how to capture important clinical characteristics affecting diabetes management, with examples including: diet, exercise, progression of symptoms, hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia awareness-thus making some good use of the data, by exploiting common features and improving the level of governance. Data governance:
 Effective diabetes data governance requires more accurate geo-localization and intercommunication between data sources. Profile descriptors and assessment standards need to be refined in view of emerging risk factors and clinically relevant variables. Patient engagement:
 A new model of data participation and share is required. Clinician-patient engagement is only one example within a web populated by other subjects. It must become clear what the influential connecting nodes are and what roles they play. The data flow from multiple sources need to be reconciled and harmonized. Many EHR do not have practical functionality to enable panel management. Relevance to the design of patient histories is needed on the basis of their disease and comorbidity trajectories. Patient education/empowerment is rudimentary in foundation builds-EHRs should better support patient communication and use of multimedia. Development of clinical decision support systems:
 User interfaces in EHR tools are often overwhelmingly busy, and relevant data lie hidden within such systems. The salient features should be easily identified to drive the user across diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A convergence to complex diabetes population maps is expected at the end of an integration process inspired by personalized view (bottom up). The traditional way of dictation has now been replaced by typing, but many face problems with data input, diminishing the quality of data entry. Also, current EHR make it difficult to access data, and even ""holding the data hostage"" practices are present, counter to medical practice standards where clinicians and administrators are increasingly tasked with population management."

Worldwide in 2018, there were 318,000 mobile apps and 200 new ones per day . These numbers have grown exponentially ever since. Introduction:
 A huge challenge for leaders in dealing with Digital Health is to figure out which technological tools to select. They have to decide if a device or application can perform as advertised. It is essential to determine if it will have an impact on the quality of care and outcomes. Affordability is always a concern too. Also, consideration must be given to legacy applications -are they worth keeping and integrating with the new? Or should they just be retired? While the first step is to find a reliable and reproducible way to identify Digital Health solutions of high quality and value, a framework for implementation is essential. Introduction:
 The myriad of stakeholders may share a high sense of urgency about Digital Health, but each has distinctive priorities that make all of this difficult to put into practice. We need to try to move Digital Health hopes systematically from ""smoke and mirrors"" to impactful reality if we are to create a truly better healthcare experience and system for all. In this chapter, let us look at the challenges of the initial selection of technological solutions. Then we will introduce a scorecard as a good starting point for evaluating the technology's quality. Next, a methodology is presented to measure outcomes. Finally, we will offer barriers to implementation, then some suggestions for a strategic framework. The challenge:
 Dr. Eric Topol, who many consider being the father of modern Digital Health, presents Artificial Intelligence as a solution to make Healthcare human again. In his book Deep Medicine, he describes how technology can do this but warns that it will be a ""marathon without a finish line."" He points out that this is mostly due to inadequacies of AI technology, both functionally and from the lack of evidencebased clinical outcomes . This scarcity of proof is the main reason why healthcare decision-makers are reluctant to invest in the resources to evaluate and use new Digital Health technologies. Lim and colleagues did a survey of CEOs from startups regarding slow healthcare adopters to digital technology. All agreed that this was due to the asymmetric impact of regulatory pressures; that is, even if a Digital Health product met regulatory requirements, healthcare providers were reluctant to accept risk as there was no evidence to support outcomes. Another reason was the need for multidisciplinary buy-in from other stakeholders . The challenge:
 Cost issues due to prior investment and ongoing maintenance of existing technological applications likely play a role. Most organizations have not done reliable cost analysis studies. When we have looked at this informally within our national organization, retiring legacy applications that were not needed or not useful lead to substantial overall one-time and annual cost savings even with the added expense of new solutions."

My central hypothesis is that presence of specific anaerobic bacteria will increase dATP in FGT. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: De-identified HIV-negative cervical tissues from women undergoing gynecological surgeries will be procured and a punch biopsy will be used to create explants. TFVdp/dATP concentrations were both tested in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions after a 24-hour incubation in tenofovir (TFV) to determine any changes between conditions. TFVdp/dATP in cervical tissue was be measured using LC-MS. Next, media and explants were collected at baseline to characterize donor microbiome for 6 donors. 16S microbiome sequencing was performed on extracted DNA to obtain the relative abundances of each bacteria species present. To test changes in dATP/TFVdp due to the microbiome, explants will be incubated in TFV for 24 hours with Prevotella and Dialister to specifically see how microbiomes dominated by these taxa affect dATP. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TFVdp formation between aerobic and anaerobic conditions after a 24-hour tenofovir incubation (p = 0.2) for 8 donors. dATP was not quantifiable at 24 hours in explants, so explants are being collected before 24hrs during a TFV incubation to determine how quickly dATP depletes after collection. We were able to characterize the donor microbiome in media and tissue at baseline and 24hrs which had inter variability. We did not see any presence of Prevotella or Dialister in any donors. We are working on characterizing bacteria growth over time to see how the donor microbiome would change during a 24 hour experiment in anaerobic conditions. Finally, we anticipate seeing increases in dATP with a Prevotella or Dialister supplemented donor microbiome compared to baseline donor microbiome. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The addition of vaginal dysbiosis to tissue model will increase accuracy of prediction of 100% protective TFVdp concentrations and is likely to provide a translational model that can be used to improve TFV-based PrEP in women and streamline development of future PrEP candidates, bringing more prevention options to women and ending the HIV epidemic.","Merali,Meagan Smith,Sarah Asby,Erin Binne,Gannon Kehe,Pinky Kadur,Devika Dharmala,Michael Schurr,Chaitanya Puranik,Devatha P Nair,Denver Anschutz,Medical Campus Identifying Opportunities and Challenges for Translational Informatics Approaches to Real-World Data: A Diabetes Case Study:

The objective of study is to demonstrate how informatics techniques can leverage real-world data for diabetes research and identify barriers for implementation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We evaluated informatics applications of real-world data in diabetes research conducted by the Facelli Research Group. The types of real-world data were categorized into clinical records, diabetes-related repositories, wearable sensors, and other data sources. Translational informatics applications were characterized into thematic groups of 1.) use of electronic health records, registries, and claims and other data sources to generate real-world evidence, 2.) evolution of novel methods to accelerate generation and use of real-world data, and 3.) infrastructure to support the generation and use of real-world data in translational science. A literature review is being conducted to identify additional articles meeting these themes focused on diabetes research. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: 6 research projects were included for analysis. The diabetes-focus spanned type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and general diabetes mellitus. Informatics methods included machine learning and data mining while real-world data sources included electronic medical records, the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, continuous glucose monitors, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air pollution monitors. Overall, computability of real-world data, linkage of medical concepts to standardized terminologies, volume of data, and adoption of novel artificial intelligence methods were major determinants of successful implementation. Future work will systematically evaluate informatics applications of real-world data in diabetes from the academic community at large.

This research approached these challenges by developing a cloud mobile-based Information retrieval and optimal route service delivery system for aiding the treatment of diabetic patients in Nigeria. This was achieved using Java API to run on Android OS. Each user registers and fills necessary information on this application once.","governments. According to the updated data from the international diabetes federation (IDF), the estimated global prevalence of DM reached 8.8% in 2015 and 12% of global health expenditure was due to DM in the same year . Literature Review:
 Advancement in ICT provides a variety of options for developing hardware and software deployment platforms for new test and sensor technologies. However, many of these products have not been optimized for usability or evaluated for their effectiveness in motivating or changing users' selfmanagement behaviors . For example, The work of  and  developed new ideas in the area of mobile technology for diabetes management, However, there are few published studies addressing which specific elements of mobile diabetes applications offers the greatest potential to benefit users effectively. Many mobile decision support software apps for smartphones are now available for diabetes and are intended to assist patients to make decisions in real time without having to contact their HCP. For example in Rao et al., , The author reported that they had visited the Apple iTunes store on October 9, 2009, and selected the 12 diabetes apps with the highest ratings. They found that these apps contained 22 types of data management features. The work of  identified and reviewed 71 commercial mobile diabetes applications available at the Apple applications store as well as 16 mobile diabetes applications from the medical literature. They found that these applications has incorporated inputted data from up to six monitoring tasks and provided up to seven support tasks. Future mobile decision support applications are expected to also incorporate information guided by global positioning systems, such as where to find nearby healthy restaurant foods. Patients with diabetes can use the information presented by apps to help guide their choices of medication doses, foods, or exercises. Literature Review:
 Though ICT has contributed to the positive growth of health care delivery systems in major hospitals in Nigeria, however, most healthcare providers believe that improvement in telecommunication within the hospitals will also improve the quality of healthcare. For example, up to 68% of post-surgical patients have been effectively followed up using their GSM phone contacts . This observation beams a ray of hope as it appears that with increasing availability of mobile Year phones and extension of connectivity to the rural areas, the problem t patient follow-up which has been the bane of longitudinal study design in Nigeria may be over soon. The use of telephone to schedule clinic appointments is also emerging, particularly more prominently in University College Hospital, Ibadan (UCH). Literature Review:
 In , the authors emphasized that People saddled with chronic diseases need recommendations or facts regarding disease management. These include dosage adjustment of medication and other general information that highlights correction of life styles, changes in diet and physical exercise. The ubiquity of mobile phones and its current integration in health care has made it a worthy tool to this effect. The need to evolve from regular GSM call monitoring of sick patients led to e-Health. By definition, e-Health, or digital health, is the use of emerging communication and information technologies, especially the internet, to improve health management . M-Health is a sub segment of e-Health, and it is the use of mobile computing and communication technologies (eg, mobile phones, wearable sensors) for health services and information . Mobile health technology uses techniques and advanced concepts from an array of disciplines, for example, computer science, electrical and biomedical engineering, medicine and health-related sciences ."

 Several questions persist before technological advancements in diabetes care permeate the health care sector. Practical interoperability, the capacity of two or more structures to interchange and utilize data, remains an obstacle . Cost, overhead, continued expenditures, buy-in from healthcare providers and relevant participants, and the various definitions and involvedness surrounding the term Meaningful Use are all additional barriers to implementation . The ability to replicate outcomes from previous studies remains blurry as well. For various reasons proprietary data such as source codes may be difficult to share. For example A survey of approximately 400 algorithms presented in papers at an Artificial Intelligence conference revealed around 6% of the presenters disseminated an organization's code, a third distributed information utilized to tryout their algorithms, and half provided an abridged of a source code (pseudo-code) . Even if some of this data can be obtained it remains to be seen if the results will end up the same. What's more in machine learning, which stems from mastery of previous encounters, may be influenced by the typology of speech patterns implemented. Endocrine:
 Nevertheless, diabetes remains an attractive target from AI research to apply industrial methods to solve the various complexities surrounding this disease. Many technological products have obtained approval from the FDA, are on the market, and have shown promising results. More innovative approaches are being created to challenge the status quo of current diabetic care by the enhancement of reliability, effectiveness, operability, straightforwardness, and patient, family, and provider, satisfaction with applying these products for diabetic management.

 Because of the increasing popularity of IoT and widened research opportunities several architectural frameworks have been proposed for the implementation of eHealth. The diagram bellow shows the layered architecture of IoT based intelligent healthcare system. Several technologies such as communication technology, sensor networks, data processing, cloud computing, and data visualization should be integrated to incorporate IoT related applications. Figure  shows the layered architecture of IoT systems used in healthcare. It contains five lavers namely sensing, sending, processing, storing and mining.    proposed a system that uses sensors to gather patient real-world data along with current location of the patient. It integrates artificial intelligence and geographical information of a patient to provide customized healthcare solutions using IoT. This is called as GeoAI based healthcare solution. Analysis of certain diseases not only requires qualitative data such as ECG readings but also require the data related to location, lifestyle and social behaviour of the patients. Along with ""what"", the GeoAI system uses a ""where"" component to optimize the solution. Clustering techniques, machine learning etc are helpful in the analysis of location-specific data. The geographic information can be helpful in assessing risk factors for a disease and identifying potential preventive measures. For example, those living in heavily polluted areas are suffering from asthma or some breathing problems. According to   , a term called ""Precision medicine"" or ""Precision delivery"" is becoming popular with increased use of real-time clinical data produced using EHRs. ""Precision medicine"" integrates data from EHR as well as machine learning techniques to provide the patients with customized treatments.

 In this digital environment, IoT devices are integrating into many web applications, namely for data collection and to develop smart homes, e-healthcare, smart transportation, and smart cities . The use of IoT-enabled medical devices and sensors is the most beneficial technology for designing healthcare apps today. Toda's fast-paced society makes ehealthcare increasingly important because medical costs and new ailments are on the rise. Furthermore, cloud computing and the Internet of Things are inextricably linked. Because technological improvements have increased life expectancy, SHS is extremely beneficial to the elderly. Heart attacks, asthma, diabetes, and cancer are among the life-threatening illnesses that can affect the elderly . These diseases are directly or indirectly responsible for 68 percent of deaths in people over 60.According to the United Nations, 11.7 % are over 60 years old, and this proportion is likely to rise over time. If chronic diseases in older persons are to be cured, they must be monitored continuously and detected early.Certain uncertainties are related to deviations from predicted states that make it impossible to use any probability to predict the outcome of a given action or decision. This study explores the phenomenon in the face of technological megatrends and the challenges they bring. The best decisions do not always equate to the best outcomes. Taking a decision based on general norms might sometimes result in worse outcomes than breaking them. As a result of the surrounding future predictions, such a situation is feasible. I. INTRODUCTION:
 The basic principle of the smart healthcare ecosystem is to utilize smart devices, sensors, and IoT to provide improved healthcare services to smart city residents at any location and time at a low cost[7] . Because the physician-to-patient ratio in developing countries is so standard, smart healthcare can help monitor patient health from afar using body sensors that transfer data to the cloud. It is accessible to physicians, who can use it to prescribe medication. These implantable or wearable sensors, which can be used for remote health monitoring, are widely available on the market.Arduino and Raspberry Pi are used in some IoT-based healthcare devices.We must undertake procedures (i) To retrieve significantly efficient and robust features of recorded data and (ii) To develop prediction models using standard data mining approaches and statistical analysis methods.

Though AI is used throughout the healthcare business, three areas in which it is showing promising results are diagnostics, pathogen tracking, and patient monitoring. . D i a g n o s i s:
 The capacity to detect patient problems correctly can have a substantial impact on patient outcomes. Fortunately, new advancements in AI technology are allowing doctors to make a more accurate diagnosis in less time. Deep-learning technology was recently utilised to detect genetic alterations in tumour tissue, a discovery that could lead to less invasive and speedier cancer detection.  2 .

 The COVID-19 shifted our perspective on healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the world is far more complex than we could have thought, with notions like ""super spreaders"" emerging. Traditional virology and public health strategies swiftly proved ineffectual in preparing us for the spread of a fatal virus in our hyperconnected society, forcing us to adopt new approaches. Virologists, healthcare providers, and technology developers were able to collaborate to increase the accuracy of COVID-19 forecasting and mapping models thanks to breakthroughs in AI networking algorithms. .

 The various methods healthcare practitioners are improving patient outcomes by deploying wireless patient monitoring technologies are discussed in relation to remote patient monitoring systems. Healthcare professionals are taking treatment to a whole new level by adding AI into remote patient monitoring systems. One diabetes monitoring startup has unveiled a device that feeds data received from its non-invasive patch into an algorithm that can aid in treatment decision-making. 14 C h a l l e n g e s A s so c i a t e d w i t h I n c o r p o r a t i n g A r t i fi c i a l I n t e l l i g e n c e i n Me d i c a l D e v i c e s:
 AI is a relatively young issue in the realm of medical devices. Unlike many traditional medical devices, which are often built by teams of material, mechanical, and electrical engineers, AI-based medical devices necessitate knowledge of software coding and programming.  Recruiting people with the expertise and skill to construct AI systems is thus one of the most difficult aspects of putting AI into medical devices. Government regulation is another hurdle to overcome when it comes to putting AI into medical equipment. Unlike locating and recruiting AI professionals, which may be simpler for some organizations than others, determining the regulatory framework for AI-based products is a barrier that the entire sector must conquer. 14"

AI based computer-assisted diagnosis tools can have a tremendous benefit if they can outperform or perform similarly to the level of a clinical expert. As a result, advanced healthcare services can be affordable in developing nations, and the problem of a lack of expert medical practitioners can be addressed. AI based tools can save time, resources, and overall cost for patient treatment. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, AI can uncover complex relations in the data from a large set of inputs and even lead to new evidence-based knowledge in medicine. However, integrating AI in healthcare raises several ethical and philosophical concerns, such as bias, transparency, autonomy, responsibility and accountability, which must be addressed before integrating such tools into clinical settings. In this article, we emphasize recent advances in AI-assisted medical image analysis, existing standards, and the significance of comprehending ethical issues and best practices for the applications of AI in clinical settings. We cover the technical and ethical challenges of AI and the implications of deploying AI in hospitals and public organizations. We also discuss promising key measures and techniques to address the ethical challenges, data scarcity, racial bias, lack of transparency, and algorithmic bias. Finally, we provide our recommendation and future directions for addressing the ethical challenges associated with AI in healthcare applications, with the goal of deploying AI into the clinical settings to make the workflow more efficient, accurate, accessible, transparent, and reliable for the patient worldwide.

 AI has made remarkable progress in radiology tasks such as breast cancer screening  . A medical device named ""Koios DS for Breast"" can analyze breast ultrasound images adeptly  . Similarly, there is a commercially available medical device ""syngo.CT Lung CAD""  for screening of lung cancer. Apart from radiology, there is also considerable advancement in cardiac function assessment  . Beyond this, there is a pioneering contribution from Google Health in integrating AI in healthcare. Google Health's 'Care Studio' provides a time-saving platform for clinicians to spend more time with the patients for their care rather than searching information for diseases such as Diabetes, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy etc  . Google Health's 'DermAssist' app can help find skin conditions with a few questions and three photos  . Likewise, Google Health is working to improve genome accuracy in person for recognizing a person's DNA to fight against different types of cancer and abnormalities by using a deep neural network  . At the same time, Google Health is researching different Table . Ethical and legal concerns and use of AI in different areas of medicine. It is to be noted that AI application, ethical concerns, and legal concerns can be for more than one 'area of medicine'. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) based tools have received approval from the US FDA at a high rate  . Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, responsible for handling public insurance reimbursement, has approved the adaptation of AI in a clinical setting. The center will reimburse for the two specific AI systems for medical image diagnosis task  . This advance shows more AI-based tools will receive FDA approval. However, for the FDA approval of the AI-based systems in the clinic, a high regulatory bar should be met (for example, prospective study, multi-center and diverse data, transparency, safety, and extensive technical validation will be required to observe if it will improve clinical workflow and patient care). Accenture analysis estimates that when combined, the AI application in clinical healthcare can save up to 150 billion annually by 2026 only in the United States  . S.N Areas of:
 The main healthcare applications of AI are telemedicine, electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging, healthcare wearables and devices, disease management systems, medical data analytics, robot-assisted surgery, and administrative workflow assistance. The other applications include fraud detection, dosage error reduction, connected machines, and cybersecurity. AI helps identify disease and diagnosis, drug discovery, medical image diagnosis, personalized medicine, intelligent health records, clinical trials and research, crowdsourced data collection, better radiotherapy, prognosis, and outbreak prediction. The study highlights critical issues towards implementing healthcare-based AI technologies.

National scale randomized control trials are underway to systematically measure the efficacy and economic benefits of this digital health care system. Precision medicine aims to maximize effectiveness of disease management by considering individual variability. Digital health technologies enable precision medicine at a reasonable cost that was not available before. The government launched the “National Integrated Bio-big Data Project” which will collect diverse health data from the participants.

In summary, ICT increases communication accessibility between patients and healthcare providers, accelerating the advent of mobile healthcare. ICT-based diabetes care has been shown to be effective and cost-efficient. With national support, ICT-based primary care services for diabetes will largely expand. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION MEDICINE IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES: Digital technology provides unprecedented quantity and quality of patient-generated health data (PGHD), accelerating the advent of precision medicine in diabetes care. Patients with diabetes share heterogeneous pathophysiology and phenotypes that require life-long individualized management . In 2015, former U.S. President Barack Obama announced the launch of the Precision Medicine Initiative . Since then, large-scale investments and actions have been undertaken to enable precision medicine. Precision medicine aims to predict the individual risk of developing various diseases and provide the most optimal therapy for those who already have diseases . To achieve this goal, it is important to understand how environmental and genetic factors and their interactions contribute to the development of diseases and understand the variation in individual responses to medical treatments . Each nation has organized large-scale cohorts to collect and analyze medical information and biological samples. National Institutes of Health in the U.S. initiated enrollment of a national cohort (""All of the US"") in 2018 to collect medical information (electronic health record), PGHD, and biological samples (DNA, metabolite, proteome). The cohort aims to engage >1 million participants, and approximately 35% of individuals were enrolled 2 years after the launch of the program . ""The Million Veteran Program"" directed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, is also under progress and has already enrolled 0.9 million participants . The U.K. biobank engaged 0.5 million participants, and further plans to pursue their project until the number of participants reaches 5 million . Finland organized ""FinnGen"" project in 2017 to enroll 0.5 million participants . China has also organized a national precision medicine project aimed at enrolling 1 million participants . One of the main hurdles in collecting data for largescale national cohorts is the integration of EMRs. EMRs were initially developed to efficiently share health information between physicians, patients, insurance companies, and researchers. However, integrating high-throughput EMR data remains challenging because of the diverse number of EMR platforms, the un-unified use of medical terminologies, and the lack of important patient information . Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled us to deal with missing values and systematically analyze high volumes of EMR data . In addition, the ontological classification of medical records provides a link between heterogeneously described medical records and biologically meaningful phenotypes . Data security and storage are other important issues in integrating EMR data and adopting them in precision medicine . I have participated in ""The digital healthcare special committee belonging to the president committee fourth industrial revolution"" in South Korea and organized the ""My-Healthway"" system. ""My-Healthway"" enables each individual to store their personal health record (PHR) in a personal cloud or mobile smartphone (Fig. ) . As a result, each individual can take the initiative for integrating and managing their own medical data and transferring them to others, such as hospitals, government, insurance companies, and researchers, when necessary.

These studies can improve the quality of research from public health groups and recognize issues that were unnoticed before. HEALTH CARE'S FUTURE ANALYTIC NEEDS:
 To achieve all the benefits of real-time, clinical AI/ML approaches to patient cohorts and individual clinical analytics, the computing infrastructure needs to support very large-scale data storage and highly scalable, intensive computing platforms. The main conceptual solution to these needs is the use of large-scale cloud computing and shared access to these resources in an extensible way. As cloud systems are typically outsourced, there is also increased compatibility with existing infrastructure, which lowers the overall cost and improves accessibility for smaller health care systems. These systems are also highly scalable for increased use with future growth. In edge computing, data are collected and analyzed in a geographically local vicinity. This system is much more expensive to set up as the health care facility has to buy the computational power to suit their needs as well as upkeep; however, the benefit is a lower latency period (on the order of milliseconds) as the data are processed closer to its origin. In summation, the future of health care technology is found in large-scale cloud computing, using AI methods on big health data, which can meet health care's analytic needs for clinical decision support and business intelligence.

Introduction:
 In recent years, the healthcare sector has begun to use information technology to develop modern applications and improve diagnostic procedures and treatments. Advanced technology and scientific theory are the main entities that generate vast amounts of digital data. Advanced clinical applications are the idea of recently developed information technology. In addition, advanced health care is expected to be a simple and elegant multitasking application. I. Introduction:
 These changes are incorporated as clinical model extensions (from disease-based to patient-based care), informatization development changes (from medical data to regional medical data), clinical management extension (general management to personal management), and prevention and treatment modifications (shifting of focus from disease treatment to preventive medical system) . As a result, the following changes focus on meeting the basic needs of individuals to improve their health literacy. This will improve your knowledge of healthcare services and suggest future uses of intelligent healthcare. Physicians, patients, clinical and research institutes, and other stakeholders embrace advanced medical services. Multiple aspects such as disease prevention and monitoring, prognosis and treatment, clinical management, health decision making, and medical research need to be considered. Mobile internet, cloud computing (CC), big data, 5G systems, microelectronics and artificial intelligence (AI), and smart biotechnology are considered modern healthcare milestones. These methodologies are used at all stages of advanced healthcare. Wearable or portable devices, from the perspective of patients, can be used to monitor their health condition as needed. They can seek clinical advice via virtual support and remotely control their homes via remote facilities. Smart clinical decision support systems, in the opinion of doctors, can be used to guide and improve diagnostic procedures. An extensive diffusion and deployment of effectively integrated hardware and modern medical sensors for one-of-a-kind healthcare has aimed to create a new concept known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). It changes the healthcare process and the number of medical devices that use IoT in order to increase profits in the future . I. Introduction:
 The data collected using portable, ingestible, and integrated sensors, mobile patterns, and device usage patterns allow the researcher to track a user's habits. With additional data collection, it is possible to reveal their medical status using cutting-edge methods such as Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL). Traditional cloud technology, which is based on structures for big data analysis, is used to provide optimal performance, scalability, and support for nonsafety and delay-based IoT domains. However, if a patient is seriously ill with limited resources and requires a high level of efficiency and accessibility, disconnection from the main network or latency difference may have a dramatic negative effect and result in dreadful consequences in emergency situations. I. Introduction:
 The rapid development of structures that investigate the collaboration of cloud, fog, and edge computing is still a difficult process . This method's main goal is to use complete edge nodes and low-level fog nodes to manage functional tasks such as data processing, examination, correlation, and inference. As a result, the aforementioned approaches produce difficult outcomes by implementing scalable medical domain services."

 Based on edge computing and artificial intelligence, this article has launched an in-depth study on the health management service system. The research is mainly carried out from the following aspects: this article describes the technologies and methods involved in the health management service system, including edge computing, artificial intelligence, query optimization algorithms for distributed heterogeneous databases, and decision-making in the data transmission scheduling method. This article introduces the structural framework and database design of the health management service system, and the experimental data confirms the superiority of the system in increasing the utilization rate of user health files and improving the user's health management service experience. Technology Used in the Health Management:
 Service System Based on Edge Computing  . Compared with cloud computing, edge computing can achieve user response faster and improve processing efficiency. At present, relevant research on edge computing technology at home and abroad is mainly aimed at the connection between mobile devices and cloud platforms, which mainly depends on the rapid development of mobile devices in contemporary society and its important position in modern society . In order to effectively solve the high network load, high bandwidth, low latency, and other requirements brought about by the rapid development of the mobile Internet and the Internet of Things, the concept of mobile edge computing (MEC) was proposed and has received extensive attention from academia and industry . Technology Used in the Health Management:
 As a hot technology, edge computing has been widely used in the business field. Among them, Internet companies hope to extend their existing cloud service capabilities to the edge network by taking advantage of their own service industry-related advantages . The main difficulty in the current system lies in the integration of heterogeneous data and the collaboration between various platforms. As the data belongs to different subsystems, a unified data model needs to be established at the edge nodes . Although the various attributes of edge devices continue to improve, in order to make the overall performance more efficient, it is necessary to strategically migrate cloud services under the premise of considering the operating capabilities of edge devices and future scalability . Artificial Intelligence-Based Health Management System.:
 Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science, and its essence lies in the simulation and expansion of human intelligence through machines . Judging from the current health service provision, the development of artificial intelligence mobile communication technology can provide a more convenient way to meet the diverse health needs of residents . When analyzing the needs of the health management service system, this article believes that the system should have the functions of collecting user health information, storing and transmitting user health data, and analyzing and counting user health data. Therefore, in the system design, this paper combines the edge computing concept to divide the system into five levels . Figure  shows the structural design of the health management service system."
"Feasibility and Acceptability of Using Mobile Health Apps in Underserved Patients with Diabetes","https://scispace.com/paper/feasibility-and-acceptability-of-using-mobile-health-apps-in-2vv696cyat","2021","Dissertation","","Jieyu Luo","10.21007/ETD.CGHS.2021.0538","https://scispace.com/pdf/feasibility-and-acceptability-of-using-mobile-health-apps-in-2vv696cyat.pdf","Introduction. Diabetes mellitus is a condition with a growing morbidity and mortality burden. An estimated 30 million adults currently live with diabetes, with each individual spending over $9500 annually on medical care. The successful management of diabetes is a lifelong endeavor. This involves balancing a variety of factors including diet, medications, and glucose monitoring. It has been well established that successful control of diabetes depends largely upon patients’ daily lifestyle habits and activities. Not all patients, however, have the resources necessary for effective diabetes management. Health disparities lead to a higher rate of diabetes development in minority and poor populations. Since underserved patients have limited access to traditional healthcare avenues, providers should explore other means, like mobile health (mHealth), to help such patients. The rapid adoption of smartphones within the last decade has allowed an opportunity for patients to use mHealth and smartphone applications (apps) as a lowcost way to get health information and services. mHealth has the potential to address such disparities in access to health care. Little is known about the effectiveness of using apps to help underserved patients with their diabetes management. Assessing these patients’ current self-management practices and their interest in using smartphone apps for their diabetes management is the first step in determining how mHealth may benefit this patient population. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to assess how underserved patients with limited access to primary care physicians handled their diabetes on their own at home, to determine what challenges they faced with their self-management, and to examine their willingness to use diabetes mHealth apps on their smartphones to assist with their diabetes management. Methods. This study employed purposive sampling to select patients for individual interviews. Participant selection occurred at a Memphis hospital located in an area of town with predominately low-income and minority residents, as well as a high prevalence of diabetes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on-site at the hospital based on McNamara’s interview staging. In all, 15 interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded according to the interpretative phenomenological analysis framework. Results. The data produced 5 topic clusters related to at-home diabetes management, which supported 2 overarching themes, and 7 clusters related to mHealth smartphone app use, which supported 3 overarching themes. The themes related to self-management are as follows: 1. Patients are aware that successful diabetes control requires active engagement on their part but voiced struggles related to balancing limited income and a healthy diet, how to manage fluctuating glucose readings throughout the day, and affording medications; and 2. Lacking a traditional relationship with a primary care doctor, these underserved patients turn to friends and family, written materials, and the internet as health care resources. The themes related to smartphone mHealth are as follows: 1. Despite limited knowledge about health apps and varying phone use patterns, patients were all willing to try at least one diabetes-related app; 2. App functions should be individualized to meet each patient’s needs for maximum benefit; and 3. Barriers to app use were varied but commonly included knowledge and technological challenges and security issues. Conclusion. Interviews from this vulnerable population demonstrated that individuals understood the importance of their own active involvement in controlling their diabetes. Yet, because of limited economic and health care resources, these patients struggle with the implementation of effective lifestyle choices in their daily routine. Furthermore, interviewees expressed interest in trying mobile health apps for diabetes management, despite minimal knowledge about the technology. Responses showed that selecting apps tailored to each individual’s needs, instead of offering one blanket multifunctional app, would provide patients with the greatest benefit. Smartphone apps may be a low-cost health resource that patients without regular access to physicians can use for their at-home diabetes management.

The provider could then recommend one or two apps based on the patient's response. To be most effective, providers would also need to help patients install the app on their phones, launch the app, and use the features within the app. Implications for Discharge Planning:
 One significant reason that patients who met the inclusion criteria could not participate in this study was a lack of transportation for a return trip back to the hospital. This is an example of how resource poor this sample population was. Limited transportation along with low income and/or lack of health insurance restricts these patients' access to traditional healthcare resources like clinics and physician offices. This is the resource niche that diabetes apps can fill. Unlike their troubles with transportation, all interviewees in this study indicated either ownership of or proximity to someone with ownership of a smartphone. Introducing an app to the patients at discharge would provide them with a low-cost, easily accessible resource that they could turn to on a daily basis at home. Also, having a healthcare provider offer recommendations and education might instill trustworthiness in an app. A provider recommendation would offer confidence in both the app itself as a health tool, as opposed to spam or malicious software, and the health information offered within the app. This could help address concerns related to privacy and security that some patients brought up during their interviews. Training for Healthcare Providers:
 In order for the discharge process to provide the greatest benefit to these underserved patients, the healthcare workers involved would first need adequate education. Healthcare providers themselves would first have to be comfortable with using smartphones. Initially, providers would need to create a rubric to vet diabetes apps for accuracy of information, ease of use for their specific patient population, and digital security. To maximize patient benefit, each healthcare facility should develop its rubric based on characteristics like literacy level of the patient population they serve. Providers would then need to familiarize themselves with the apps that scored highest on their grading scale within each broader category of diabetes management like glucose/symptom monitoring or diet/carbohydrate counting. Thus, at discharge, providers would be able to make an informed decision on the best app to recommend each patient for home use going forward. Future Cost and Clinical Impact:
 Once acceptability and openness to diabetes app use has been established, as with the underserved population in this study, it opens the way to many other future considerations for incorporating mHealth into healthcare practice. From a clinical standpoint, future studies could examine the effect of at-home app use on blood glucose or HbA1c measurements in low income and racial and ethnic minority patient groups with diabetes. These studies could compare app vs. no app use over different periods of time from as short as a month to as long as a year. This could help determine the minimum amount of time individuals would have to use a diabetes app to start seeing any health benefits, as well as the frequency with which patients would have to interact with an app on a daily or weekly basis. Additionally, this would keep people from quitting app use too early, within a few days or weeks, if there were published results on how long it could possibly take to notice changes. Study results showing a significant decline in glucose or HbA1c markers would demonstrate that apps could be a clinically effective tool for a population that would otherwise struggle to access traditional pathways to healthcare."

We found three main pillars of work towards this end: low-cost hardware for the affordability of medical devices, use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools for scalability and operational efficiencies in healthcare services, and mobile health solutions. Several emerging technologies are also promising for healthcare in low-resource regions, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain technology. We discuss these emerging technologies too in this review. ","at the local health center, an EMR server of the health center, etc. Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare: A review of IoT for healthcare, though not specific to low-resource settings, has been presented in the work of . Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare:
 The authors discuss various IoT use-cases for healthcare applications. The potential of large-scale IoT for applications in community health monitoring discusses concepts like interactions between multiple body area networks. An interesting use case is IoT's use for emergency healthcare services during a disaster. In low-resource settings where the reach of standard healthcare services is limited, connectivity of devices could help monitor and plan resource utilization, casualties mapping, etc. One other use case discussed is the possibility to track population-level information on adverse drug reactions. This can immediately be extended to applications specific to low-resource settings e.g., tracking outbreaks and the spread of specific diseases related to low-quality water supply, for example. IoT can also be applied for awareness campaigns by providing a platform for easy dissemination of information. Blockchain technology for healthcare:
 One of the recent technological advancements with huge potential in the healthcare sector, positively impacting the increase of the outreach in low-resource settings, is blockchain technology. Blockchain technology enables a way to keep a record of the transaction without a need for an intermediary. This mechanism opens up various applications in healthcare that would otherwise have been difficult to deploy. As blockchain provides a trust mechanism between multiple parties, one of the most explored applications of blockchain in healthcare is the sharing of data. This application is very relevant for low-resource settings for two reasons. First, as healthcare services and providers are not resourceful, sharing data between different entities is difficult. E.g., healthcare facilities might not have enough software and resources to open up their data to third parties without incurring a major security and privacy threat. Second, the new applications that can be enabled with easy data sharing would be crucial in low-resource settings to enable applications like automated diagnosis, telemedicine, or any general mHealth applications."

 provide the physician with a greater understanding of the specific patient. The Netherlands employs artificial intelligence to analyze its health system, finding therapeutic errors and inconsistencies in order to reduce avoidable hospitalization . Aside from existing innovations, several advancements are in different stages of exploration that will assist doctors in becoming general practitioners. IBM's Watson Healthcare is a good illustration of this, as it will be able to detect heart problems and tumor indications quickly. A system for Intelligence healthcare is being developed at Stanford University (PAC). Through the use of many detectors, PAC has developed a sophisticated senior well-being assistance system and sophisticated ICUs that will detect any behaviour change in older adults residing independently and ICU victims. Smart Handwashing Assistance and Health insurance Conversation Interfaces are two other initiatives that PAC is working on. Healthcare diagnostics:
 Depth detectors and computational vision technologies are being used to provide ideal hand washing for physicians and nurses' personnel, minimizing healthcare associated infections. Medical conversation initiatives examine how Siri, Google Now, S voice, and Cortana responds to queries from portable device users about mental wellbeing, antisocial behaviour, and physical wellbeing, enabling individuals to access treatment sooner. Molly is a computerized nurse who will give follow-up treatment to released individuals, enabling physicians to concentrate on more urgent problems. In the future, AI will play a significant role in medicine. As a result, it is critical to educate the next generation of medical students about the principles and applications of AI, as well as how to operate effectively in a workplace alongside robots for increased efficiency, while also developing soft skills such as empathy."

Identifying which diabetic patients are at a risk of dose escalation or to a basal bolus regimen can therefore be of value to health systems to manage the risk upfront to lower downstream costs. b. Shaping Patient Behaviors:
 Research suggests that if behavior-related risk factors were eliminated, 80% of all heart disease, diabetes and stroke could be prevented, as could more than 40% of US cancer cases and deaths . AI/ML engines that drive a precision nudging solution to shape patient behaviors in chronic, acute, and preventative care settings can therefore significantly improve health outcomes . AI/ML based technologies can draw data from a variety of sources including from the participant's wearables and personal devices, surveys, and participant response patterns. These data help understand a user's motivation and ability to carry out specific health actions at any given time. Using data science and reinforcement learning techniques of AI, it is possible to design intelligent triggers or precision nudges sent via the participant's preferred channel at the right time and at the right frequency to persuade them to take tiny steps toward their health goals. Collectively, these steps help them adhere to their overall care plan including managing diet, exercise, sleep, emotional health, and prescribed care plans to achieve better health outcomes. There are very promising results from recent deployments of nudging technologies in both chronic and acute care settings within health systems in the US and Europe. c. Reducing Healthcare Delivery Costs Using Combination Therapies That Include Prescription Drugs (Rx) and Digital Therapeutics:
 To optimally deploy digital technologies in combination with Rx therapeutics, it is important to triage diseases along a continuum-starting from intuitive approaches to medicine at one end of the spectrum to probabilistic empirical approaches, and evidence-based precision approaches at the other end. Precision care is most suited to benefit from the integration of digital technology as discrete parts of care pathways can be task shifted from high cost venues and providers of care to lower cost ones including to domiciliary settings. For example, dose titration of insulin using FDA approved dose titration apps allows glycemic control to be achieved faster with lower risk of hypoglycemia induced by patient-led modulation of insulin doses. Going forward, real-world evidence will help demonstrate ongoing value of such solutions by collecting, organizing and activating health information eventually leading to inclusion of such combination therapies in treatment guidelines ."

This is due the fact that Glucose level could change drastically and lead to critical conditions reaching to death in some advance cases. To prevent this issues, diabetes patient are always advised to monitor their glucose level at least three times a day. Fingertip pricking - as the traditional method for glucose level tracking - leads patients to be distress and it might infect the skin. In some cases, tracking the glucose level might be a hard job especially if the patient is a child, senior, or even have several other health issues. In this paper, an optimum solution to this drawback by adopting the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based non-invasive strategies has been proposed. Near-Infrared (NIR) -as an optical method of the non-invasive technique - has been adopted to help diabetic patients in continuously monitoring their blood without pain. The proposed solution will alert the patients’ parents or guardians of their situation when they about to reach critical conditions specially at night by sending alarms and notifications by Short Messages (SMS) along with the patients current location to up to three people. Moreover, a Machine Learning (ML) model is implemented to predict future events where the patient might have serious issues. This model prediction is best practice in this chronic health domain as it has never been implemented to predicted a future forecast of the patient chart. Multivariate Time-Series data set (i.e. AIM ’94) has been used to train the proposed ML model.

Design/methodology/approach Potential barriers and their interrelationships in their respective contexts have been uncovered. Using MICMAC analysis, the categorization of these barriers was done based on their degree of reliance and driving power (DP). Furthermore, an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) framework for the barriers to mHealth activities in India has been proposed. Findings The study explores a total of 15 factors that reduce the efficiency of mHealth adoption in India. The findings of the Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) investigation show that the economic situation of the government, concerns regarding the safety of intellectual technologies and privacy issues are the primary obstacles because of the significant driving power they have in mHealth applications. Practical implications Promoters of mHealth practices may be able to make better plans if they understand the social barriers and how they affect each other; this leads to easier adoption of these practices. The findings of this study might be helpful for governments of developing nations to produce standards relating to the deployment of mHealth; this will increase the efficiency with which it is adopted. Originality/value At this time, there is no comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence the adoption of mobile health care with social cognitive theory in developing nations like India. In addition, there is a lack of research in investigating how each of these elements affects the success of mHealth activities and how the others interact with them. Because developed nations learnt the value of mHealth practices during the recent pandemic, this study, by investigating the obstacles to the adoption of mHealth and their inter-relationships, makes an important addition to both theory and practice. ","Formulating and implementing operational strategies to improve long-term performance in three areas-social, environmental and economic-is the main objective of healthcare industries these days. These three components should be improved by the government and businesses in order to improve customer satisfaction in mHealth care . Advances in intellectual technologies and its barriers to mHealth practices: Computer vision is currently being utilised to identify confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease by analysis of X-ray image datasets. This is due to the widespread use of digital technology in mHealth services . AI and other tools have been united in other healthcare service areas , e.g. in the research to categorise cancer as well as treatment research, Alzheimer, stroke, cardiology, etc. . In their study, suggested a mHealth programme for measuring and preventing heart problems, with doctors being notified if signs are detected. Given the abundance of data linked to false alerts, a Bayes classification predictive model was employed to sort the data and limit the number of false alerts created by the network. Other similar studies include the creation of a psychological intervention that can forecast a patient's reply . Algorithms have also been used to manage digital limb, a game-based technology that employs the theory of augmented reality to cure limb pains . Additionally, machine learning has been used in speech recognition in people suffering from dysarthria . Blockchain, cloud computing and AI have all had a significant effect on the current technology being used in numerous sectors, the drugs industry being no exception. While cloud computing provides patient care features such as digital extra storage, data systems and remote monitoring, it also provides developers and medical doctors with technical independence as an integral part of the organisation . Because of the vast amount of data created by the use of these devices, standard data analysis techniques can overload the system, necessitating the use of statistical tools for data interpretation. IOT and AI are currently being used in digital healthcare devices like phones and point-of-care platforms all around the globe, thanks to recent advancements . Currently, AI-enabled technologies use supervised, unstructured, or reinforced learning techniques. Machine learning, a type of AI, is being employed in image and diagnostic analytics, early disease diagnosis, self-care systems, research and innovation; it can also be used to uncover regularities. BCT, based on the notion of a distributed ledger system, allows for a decentralised system. This notion has been implemented in edge computing, which combines peer-to-peer networking, distributed digital data, immutability, privacy and cloud access; this is seen in well-known cryptocurrency setups such as Bitcoin and Ethereum . Regarding the need for transferring data that allows access, integrity and privacy, BCT enables security and scalability when paired with some other techniques in the medical sector. This also facilitates accomplishment of a broad network of mHealth services . This paper will provide an insight into the more significant challenges that countries have in adopting mHealth, as well as some potential solutions. India has a doctor-to-patient ratio of 1: 10,189, which is ten times lower than the 1:1,000 proposed by the World Health Organisation . India also requires three times the number of nurses and five times the number of physicians it currently has. Infectious diseases and illnesses, chronic disorders and other concerns influence the lives of the general population. Doctors have ISM analysis of barriers of mHealth adoption recorded 47% of technical challenges and 39% of time scheduling concerns with telemedicine; 31% of patients felt uncomfortable facing the camera, while 24% had technological issues . While health resources are redundant in certain major cities, this reflects the variation of medical resources and the difficulties faced by nurses working with mHealth technology.

However, the integration of AI within healthcare is fraught with difficulties. Heterogeneity among healthcare system applications, reliance on proprietary closed-source software, and rising cyber-security threats pose significant challenges. Moreover, prior to their deployment in clinical settings, AI models must demonstrate their effectiveness across a wide range of scenarios and must be validated by prospective studies, but doing so requires testing in an environment mirroring the clinical workflow which is difficult to achieve without dedicated software.

Angina pectoris is a prominent vital sign of myocardial infarction. Medical reports suggest that experiencing chest pain during heart attacks causes changes in facial muscles, resulting in variations in patterns of facial expression. This work intends to develop an automatic facial expression detection to identify the severity of chest pain as a vital sign of MI, using an algorithmic approach that is implemented with a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). The advanced object detection lightweight CNN models are as follows: Single Shot Detector Mobile Net V2, and Single Shot Detector Inception V2, which were utilized for designing the vital signs MI model from the 500 Red Blue Green Color images private dataset. The authors developed cardiac emergency health monitoring care using an Edge Artificial Intelligence (“Edge AI”) using NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano embedded GPU platform. The proposed model is mainly focused on the factors of low cost and less power consumption for onboard real-time detection of vital signs of myocardial infarction. The evaluated metrics achieve a mean Average Precision of 85.18%, Average Recall of 88.32%, and 6.85 frames per second for the generated detections.","existing clinical practices in diagnosing chest pain treatment are time-consuming and involve costly procedures in the treatment process that need to be adapted. A focus has been made by researchers to develop more effective methods for evaluating chest pain caused by myocardial infarction. Introduction:
 This idea helped us begin developing an edge-based AI model that interprets the expressions of the face to evaluate the intensity of angina pectoris. Introduction:
 Therefore, the patients with high complications with MI who need immediate attention can be called in for an emergency procedure and be admitted to the hospital at the earliest possibility. Introduction:
 The research community has been constantly exploring integral solutions for remote monitoring of patients by generating reports to the clinicians for more than a decade. The primary motivation is to address healthcare issues at all levels: pediatric care, disease monitoring, elderly supervision, emergency patients handling, fitness, and private health management. Introduction:
 In recent years, efficient combinations of cloud computing and effective Internet of Things architectures, along with algorithmic approaches of artificial intelligence (AI), have been exploited to develop a product model for real-time smart health care applications. Introduction:
 Data captured by embedded sensors, wearable devices, smartphones, and Internet of Things devices may help to explore the habits and patterns of a person and be effectively utilized in the healthcare domain to solve existing problems through state-of-the-art AI-based approaches . Introduction:
 The concept of edge intelligence (""Edge AI"") is to ""provide AI for every person, anytime, anywhere at all concerns."" The Edge IoT devices were developed with built-in AI models to acquire the sensor data and decode its behavior to make accurate decisions and near--precise predictions. Introduction:
 IoT devices with Cloud-based architecture disadvantages exhibit qualities such as non-safety, low latency, and soft real-time abilities, which are critical for IoT healthcare applications. Introduction:
 However, considering the critical conditions of the patients under time-bound emergency conditions, those criticalities need high robustness, low latency, high bandwidth, and a large degree of reliable systems to avoid fatal consequences. Introduction:
 Traditional cloud computing techniques based on IoT devices pose bigger challenges in health monitoring applications, such as bandwidth issues and reliability, latency, and privacy problems. In order to overcome these challenges, the concept of Edge AI has been introduced . Introduction:
 Presently, there are mainly three edge computing platforms, namely: i) on-device computation, in which AI computations are done locally on the end device; ii) edge-server architecture, in which the edge server does the computation task after gathering data from the edge devices called nodes; and iii) edge-cloudbased joint computation.

Responsible clinical study data sharing of appropriately consented and de-identified participant-level data and asso ciated clinical documents is an expectation of key research funders, journal editors, pharma ceutical trade associations, regulators, ethics committees, and government entities spon sor ing research. Furthermore, patients increas ingly support expanded data sharing to help spur innovation and maximise the utilisation of data gathered during clinical studies. Finally, rapidly and appropriately leveraging real-world data to support and validate clinical research data and to facilitate respons es to emerging public health emergencies lends greater importance and urgency to finding better ways to unlock and share health data. This article provides an overview of the current state of participant-level data sharing in clinical research and a discussion of the opportunities that exist to better navigate barriers to access whilst respecting the data privacy rights of study participants. This article describes our collective journey through the data sharing ecosystem, looking to further unlock the value of study participant data to drive new discoveries. Background Data obtained through clinical research are fundamental to advancing the field of medicine and to improving the health and well-being of patients. The data underlying such research have historically remained securely in the custody of the data generator (in most cases a pharma ceutical or academic study sponsor) and access was highly limited. Recently there have been increasing calls from patient groups, advocacy organisations, journal editors, pharmaceutical and biotechnology trade associations, regulators, and others in the scientific community for the responsible sharing of study patient-level datasets and/or study documentation, to provide greater transparency and propel research inno vation through secondary data reuse. Addit ionally there have been calls by many, including the World Health Organization (WHO), to accel erate and extend these data sharing paradigms to speed up the collection and dissemination of data during public health emergencies, a need exem plified during the recent Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and the COVID-19 pandemic.1 It is envisaged that by harnessing the statistical power of large data-sets the broader scientific community can embrace the “big data” revolu tion, including utilising machine learning and artificial intelligence to spur new frontiers in data analytics and data collaboration.2 Recently, all data generators have been further incentivised to share data by journal requirements to make their data sharing plans public as a pre-requisite commitment for publications (such as those aligned to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors position and associated with PLoS One journals).3,4 In addition, in 2016 the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Guiding Principles for Scientific Data Management and Stewardship5 were published to provide guidelines to data generators, to im prove the findability, accessibility, inter oper ability, and reuse of data which has further helped to propel data sharing, especially from the academic perspective. As such, all clinical research data generators have experienced increasing requirements and calls to establish mechanisms to responsibly share the clinical study data they produce. This article provides an overview of patientlevel data sharing with a focus on clinical trial data sharing, a discussion of key limiters and enablers that require greater attention to opti mally unlock the value of patient-level data, and aspects of data sharing that have yet to be fully harnessed to further drive new discoveries. Data sharing process Patient-level data sharing refers to the process whereby data providers accept requests from academic and non-academic researchers for access to data and supporting documentation from formal clinical trials. Figure 1 provides an overview of the common steps of the data sharing request process that generally occur, although the process may vary based on the data provider or access platform.","the ability to understand or think accordingly. It can also be interpreted as the capability to train a computer to act like the human brain in the way it thinks. AI focuses on three major aspects (skills): learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Artificial intelligence/ machine learning:
 Machine learning (ML) is the methodology of the way a computer learns automatically on its own through experiences it had and improves without being explicitly programmed. ML is an application or subset of AI. ML focuses on the development of programs so that it can access data to use it for itself. The entire process makes observations of data to identify the possible patterns being formed and make better future decisions. The goal of ML is to allow the systems to learn by themselves through the experience, without any kind of human inter vention or assistance. Additionally, deep learning is a subset of ML that utilises neural networks to mimic brain-like behaviour. DL utilises larger sets of data than ML and focuses on information processing patterns.  AI and ML systems in medicine have the potential to significantly improve healthcare, for example, by offering earlier diagnoses of diseases or recommending optimally individualised treatment plans. Yet the emergence of AI/ML in medicine also creates challenges that regulators must pay attention to. Which medical AI/MLbased products should be reviewed by regulators? What evidence should be required to permit marketing for AI/ML-based software as a medical device (SaMD)? How can we ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML-based SaMD that may change over time as they are applied to new data? 10 Mobile medical apps:
 Mobile apps that meet the definition of a medical device must comply with the requirements of EU MDR 2017/745. Many mobile apps are not medical devices, meaning they do not meet the requirement of medical device as defined in the EU.  The use of mobile tech nologies is opening up new and innovative ways to improve health and healthcare delivery. Mobile applications (apps) can help people manage their own health and wellness, promote healthy living, and gain access to useful information when and where they need it. Users include healthcare profes sionals, consumers, and patients. Mobile medical apps:
 The development of mobile medical apps can improve health care and provide consumers and health care professionals with valuable health information. As mobile platforms become more user friendly, computationally powerful, and readily available, innovators have begun to develop mobile apps of increasing complexity to leverage the portability that mobile platforms can offer. Some of these new mobile apps are specifically targeted to assist individuals in their own health and wellness management. Other mobile apps are targeted to healthcare providers as tools to improve and facilitate the delivery of patient care.  Device regulations focus only on the apps that present a greater risk to patients if they don't work as intended and on apps that cause smartphones or other mobile platforms to impact the functionality or performance of traditional medical devices. Similar to traditional medical devices, certain mobile medical apps can pose potential risks to public health. Some mobile medical apps may pose risks that are unique to the characteristics of the platform on which the mobile medical app is run.  An example is the interpretation of radiological images on a mobile device could be adversely affected by the smaller screen size, lower contrast ratio, and any uncontrolled ambient light of the mobile platform."

Introduction:
 Given the current pandemic setting and unprecedented situation worldwide, digital technology-assisted interventions are recommended for the prevention of diabetes mellitus, which has become a current research hotspot. Introduction:
 Different forms of digital therapeutics such as online platforms, virtual reality trainings, and applications applying technological solutions to enhance healthcare are being tested the feasibility . Introduction:
 The rapid growth of information, biological, and communication technologies makes this an opportune time to develop digital tools that deliver precision interventions for health behavior change to address the diabetes mellitus crisis. Introduction:
 In recent years, systems related to clinical medical data, such as hospital information systems (HIS), clinical information systems (CIS), laboratory information systems (LIS), and electronic medical record (EMR), have accumulated large amounts of medical data. Introduction:
 With the continuous growth of medical data, the value of the data has gradually become apparent. Introduction:
 However, this also brings some challenges to digital medicine. A large amount of patient data information poured into the medical database, making the amount of medical data increase exponentially. Introduction:
 These large-scale data are accompanied by a variety of complex data forms at the same time, which increases the difficulty of studying the value of these data in terms of data quality and data structure. Introduction:
 In the system construction of traditional hospital information platform, it often includes four layers: hardware network infrastructure layer, datacenter data layer, business service layer, and data exchange layer. Introduction:
 This traditional system construction tends to be more inclined on the service side, so the analysis and processing process of massive stored data is lacking at the doctor-patient service business level supported by big data exchange and storage technology, and it is difficult to tap the huge value behind medical data. Introduction:
 Based on the above discussion, this project focuses on the research of big data processing and analysis platform based on data mining. By focusing on the latest research focus of current big data technology, this research creatively proposes three major platform building mechanisms, namely DPM, DCM, and MCM. Introduction:
 At the same time, the whole platform is structured in combination with big data platform building technology. Finally, we developed a processing and analysis platform based on real-world intelligent clinical data of diabetic patients. This platform is more suitable for complex clinical data analysis.

","for all patients, regardless of their socioeconomic status. While there have been significant advancements in RPM technology in recent years, many patients, particularly those living in rural or underserved areas, may not have access to these tools due to cost or limited availability. AI in diabetes and Glycemic control:
 Artificial intelligence is a fast-growing field with its applications for persons living with many chronic diseases such as diabetes. There has been global concern about the ever-increasing incidence rate of diabetes with one in two persons undiagnosed and untreated . The total number of people living with diabetes is likely to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045 . A recent study of 300,000 patients with type 2 diabetes on medical therapy found that after 3 months, 31% of patients had discontinued their diabetes medications that number was widened to 44% by 6 months, and to 58% by 1 year . Besides, about 75% of diabetic adults live in lowand middle-income countries with only 5% of those receiving thorough treatment according to guidelines . The best care for diabetes is mostly hindered by lack of real-time crucial health information required to make necessary choices with diabetes control and therapy. AI in diabetes and Glycemic control:
 Today, advances in AI have introduced a shift in diabetes care from conventional management approaches to targeted data-driven precision care. There is a spectrum of interventions spread across different care processes in diabetes. AI is not only being applied to predict diabetes risk utilizing genetic data and to diagnose diabetes via electronic health record data in clinical decision support but it is also transforming diabetic care and predicting the potential sequelae of diabetes such as nephropathy and retinopathy. Such solutions have enhanced the workflow of both medical staff and patients. How is AI utilized in diabetic care?:
 To help fight diabetes disease and improve its management, AI can play a vital role in diabetic care at many different levels discussed below that can benefit both providers and patients in a team-oriented approach. Diabetes prediction:
 AI can help diagnose diabetes noninvasively and proactively by identifying a subset of populations with the highest risks at a pre-illness stage. Though diabetes prediction models have been generated by conventional statistics, machine learning (ML) can maximize the predictive performance of conventional models to the next level . Algorithms built by ML can do risk stratification by analyzing genomics, lifestyles, mental and physical health, and social media activity. Earlier detection and intervention for at-risk individuals could decrease the incidence of diabetes, and the financial costs associated with uncontrolled diabetes. Lifestyle guidance for diabetes patients:
 Monitoring glucose levels in real-time is being done using wearable devices and continuous glucose monitoring systems of patient symptoms and biomarkers. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM), which are now frequently used by diabetics, acquire a large amount of data that has previously been underutilized. The amount of glucose in the fluid inside the body is measured by CGM. In certain circumstances, the sensor is glued to the back of the arm or is implanted under the skin of the belly rapidly and painlessly. The information is then sent to a wireless-pager-like monitor through a transmitter on the sensor ."

Methods: This review was done by searching the literature using three databases viz: PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Assessment of quality of studies was carried out using the scale of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The results were presented in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. 
Results: The search strategy identified 725 unique research papers, 4 of which were included. A survey among pharmacists showed that 56 % of participants were aware of the existence of mobile health applications, and that 60 % of those who were aware recommended their use. In the multi-HCPs setting, depending on the study, apps recommendation rate varied from 45.5 to 62 %. Most of the participants (88 %) agreed that a mobile app would help strengthen their treatment recommendations to the patients (88 %), and 84 % also agreed that it would help patients manage diabetes better. 
Conclusion: Not much research has been done on this topic. Available data suggest that the awareness of HCPs regarding mobile applications is unsatisfactory, and that those familiar with these apps find them useful and are ready to recommend them to patients.

 The WHO 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the NCDs as a significant challenge for sustainable development. Indeed, a goal has been set for the development of national responses that will contribute to one-third reduction in premature mortality from these diseases by 2030 . The responses involve improvements in the area of prevention, early detection and timely application of adequate therapy. INTRODUCTION:
 The accelerating development of digital technologies in recent years has contributed to significant increases in the number of options that support reduction in the spread, while ensuring better control of NCDs. Accordingly, the availability and use of software, i.e., mobile applications that help patients and health professionals in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, are also increasing . INTRODUCTION:
 The WHO defines the concept of digital health as ""a field of knowledge and practice related to the development and use of digital technologies to improve health"" . Additional term which are important for this topic are electronic health or eHealth which is related to healthcare services that are provided with the use of information and communication technologies (e.g., computers), and mobile health or m-health which is related to use of healthcare services and information that are provided with use of mobile communications (e.g., smartphones) . Electronic health is a broader term which also includes mobile health. INTRODUCTION:
 A joint report on digital applications for diabetes by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA)  indicates that the available applications comprise three groups: (i) those used to monitor the well-being of the individual, (ii) those that function as stand-alone medical devices, and (iii) those that display, download and/or use data from medical devices that diagnose, prevent, monitor or treat a certain condition. INTRODUCTION:
 It should be noted that there are no clearly defined regulations for mobile applications used to monitor the health and well-being of individuals, especially those that do not qualify for description as medical devices. On the other hand, mobile applications that belong to the category of medical devices must meet the regulatory requirements, and are overseen by relevant competent authorities . INTRODUCTION:
 Various studies indicate that mobile applications for diabetes have the potential to improve selfcontrol and therapy of the disease . Some of the beneficial effects identified in various studies are improved glycemic control, with reduction in HbA1c, weight loss, reduction in blood pressure, and decrease in LDL-C, as well as improvements in education and behavioral modifications . Most users of this category of mobile apps find them to be helpful in their communication with HCPs ."

 Digital health is ''associated with the use and development of digital technologies to improve health'' . It differs from other forms of healthcare by using a set of digital technologies, which are smart, accessible, and connected and which become central to the process of delivering healthcare. Introduction:
 These technologies are used in all areas of healthcare, including providing professional healthcare services (e.g., diagnosing and treating patients), the supporting processes that are needed to deliver care (e.g., task planning, allocation of resources, patient routing), research (including trial management), patient selfcare and health management, and health-related innovation generally. Introduction:
 Examples of digital health technologies include mobile healthcare apps, fitness trackers, wearables, personal healthcare devices -such as digital scales, digital chest belts, smart pillboxes, smaller devices used by healthcare professionals (e.g., sensor-equipped endocutters, digital stethoscopes, or intelligent carpets), implants (neuro-, cardiac, or other) that are equipped with sensors and network connections, robotic surgery, teleconsultations, and remote patient monitoring solutions. Introduction:
 Increasingly, and as advocated by the WHO (2024a), digital health is associated with the use of artificial intelligence and complementary innovations, such as the use of blockchain, to deliver on its promise to improve healthcare quality, access, and affordability. Introduction:
 These technologies on the one hand digitize healthcare and on the other hand enable new forms of interactions between patients and healthcare providers, such as sharing decisions between physicians and patients . Introduction:
 While digital health fundamentally relies on technology, it does not imply that technology is the sole component or that organizational and cultural factors are not significant to its uses. Introduction:
 On the contrary, effective developments with digital health necessitate careful consideration and research regarding how these technologies will come into play in patients' lives as well as the organizational and institutional context in which these technologies are embedded (e.g., . Introduction:
 For instance, continuous (remote) monitoring will significantly alter the structure of healthcare professionals' work environments and how patients are managed, and self-manage, within these environments (e.g., . Introduction:
 Moreover, although it is often stated that digital health facilitates a patient-centered shift in healthcare, research indicates that this is not always the case. Thus, intentional efforts to address unintended consequences and side effects of adopting digital health technologies in healthcare are essential (e.g., . Introduction:
 Digital health is increasingly a data-centered paradigm. While digital health technologies generate data that are used to provide immediate feedback to its users (e.g., , these technologies also produce data for secondary uses. Introduction:
 This includes integration into large platforms and infrastructures increasingly prevalent in healthcare systems, for training algorithms, and ultimately for stimulating health research and innovation. Common ways in which data are used is in software-as-a-medical devices and AI-based decision support systems (e.g., in radiology). Introduction:
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), responsible for approving and overseeing drugs and medical devices, has reviewed 692 AI-enabled medical devices . While radiology predominates, other medical specialties, such as cardiology and neurology, are rapidly advancing."

This paper investigates the application of these advanced technologies in real-time disease detection, showcasing their potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Smart healthcare systems leverage a multitude of technological components, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI), to enable continuous monitoring and diagnostics. This real-time monitoring facilitates prompt interventions and treatment adjustments, which is particularly advantageous for managing chronic conditions and acute illnesses where timely responses are critical to improving patient outcomes. Despite the evident benefits, traditional healthcare infrastructures face significant challenges such as delays in diagnosis due to manual processes, inefficient data handling resulting in data silos, and limited interoperability between different healthcare providers, leading to worsened health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. The integration of ML and big data analytics offers promising solutions to these challenges. ML algorithms can process vast amounts of healthcare data to identify patterns and predict outcomes with high accuracy, such as recognizing early signs of diseases like cancer or diabetes from medical images or electronic health records (EHRs). Big data analytics complements ML by providing the necessary infrastructure to handle and process large volumes of health data, enabling the collection, storage, and analysis of structured data from EHRs, unstructured data from clinical notes, and real-time data from wearable devices. By integrating these technologies, healthcare providers can gain deeper insights into patient health trends and outcomes, leading to more informed decision-making and better patient management. This study employs a qualitative research design, focusing on five genuine case studies: the Mayo Clinic's predictive analytics for heart disease, Cleveland Clinic's use of ML for cancer diagnosis, Kaiser Permanente's diabetes management program, Johns Hopkins Hospital's sepsis detection system, and Mount Sinai Health System's genomic data analysis. Each case study is chosen for its relevance and comprehensive data, detailing the specific healthcare environment and context. This paper interprets these findings in the broader context of smart healthcare systems and existing literature, emphasizing the importance of these technologies in modernizing healthcare and addressing inefficiencies. The challenges encountered during integration, such as data privacy concerns and interoperability issues, are examined along with implemented solutions. ","disease, Cleveland Clinic's ML for cancer diagnosis, Kaiser Permanente's diabetes management program, Johns Hopkins Hospital's sepsis detection system, and Mount Sinai Health System's genomic data analysis-demonstrates the practical benefits of these integrated approaches. Conclusion:
 The findings align with existing literature, emphasizing that ML and big data analytics can significantly improve healthcare delivery by providing timely, accurate, and personalized care. These technologies enhance diagnostic accuracy and speed, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Conclusion:
 However, challenges such as data privacy concerns, interoperability issues, and the need for substantial computational resources must be addressed for successful implementation. Future research should explore the scalability of these technologies in diverse settings and investigate their long-term impacts on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Conclusion:
 The study underscores the importance of efficient data handling and the application of advanced ML algorithms to analyze complex health data, highlighting the transformative potential of these technologies to revolutionize healthcare. Conclusion:

In order to effectively deal with potential future health risks, such as diseases that might be more lethal and widespread than COVID-19, strong and adaptable health systems will need to be built. The provision of relief by the government in the form of aid for healthcare and contingency planning becomes a source of delight in light of the insights gained from the present predicament. The advancement of general healthcare as well as the identification and control of epidemics might benefit significantly from the use of AI. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has expanded more rapidly in recent years as a direct result of the pandemic; yet, there are still a great number of challenging issues that need to be handled before the approaches can be used in real-world contexts. It is imperative that the World Health Organization's Department of Health Research and Technology, which is in charge of digitizing COVID-19, be established in order to provide assistance to nations whose levels of digital development differ greatly. The World Health Organization (WHO) is dedicated to assisting nations in the use of these cutting-edge technologies in order to improve the ability of health systems to respond to outbreaks and prevent future ones.","challenging for doctors to understand all the genetic variations of cancer and related responses to cutting-edge therapies and regimens. Foundation Medicine and Flatiron Health, both of which are presently owned by Roche, are two companies that specialize in this approach. Apps to Increase Patient Adherence and Engagement:
 It has long been acknowledged that the greatest barrier between bad and effective healthcare outcomes is patient involvement and adherence, the ""last mile"" challenge in healthcare. Participation in one's own health and treatment improves outcomes, costs, and satisfaction for both the provider and the member. More and more, organizations are turning to big data and AI to solve these problems. Seventy-plus percent of healthcare providers in a study of more than 300 said less than half of their patients showed substantial involvement, and 42 percent said the same thing.  Can AI-based skills adequately adjust and contextualize treatment if more patient engagement leads to a better health outcome? Complex treatments are increasingly being driven by organizational intelligence and machine learning technology throughout the medical continuum. Alert messages and time-sensitive, personalized material may be the subject of an investigation. Uses in the Field of Administration:
 A wide variety of administrative programmes serve the healthcare sector. While the transformative power of AI in this industry is lower than in healthcare, significant cost savings may still be realized. These are crucial in the healthcare industry since, on average, US doctors spend 25% of their working time on regulatory and administrative chores. RPA is the most likely tool to achieve this objective. It may be used for many healthcare-related tasks, such as billing, clinical documentation, claims processing, and record keeping. AI IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES IN HEALTHCARE:
 By the year 2025, it is expected that AI will have a considerable impact on medical supplies. This essential skill enables the development of focused therapy, which is often recognized as a critical achievement in therapy. While early efforts at diagnosis and treatment recommendations have failed, we are confident that AI will eventually become adept in this field as well. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for image processing suggest that, in the near future, mainly radiology and pathology images will be reviewed automatically. Sound and written IDs are likely to be utilized more often in healthcare records, such as for noting patient relationships and medical histories. Regardless of how useful the technologies themselves may be, adoption into conventional clinical practice remains the biggest roadblock for AI in a number of healthcare domains. Artificial intelligence systems need to be approved by regulators before they can be widely used. They also need to be integrated with EHR systems, organized so that comparable products operate efficiently, taught to physicians, supported by public or private payer-funded groups, and improved over time in the field. We will succeed in overcoming these obstacles, but this will take a lot longer than the technical progress itself. Therefore, we expect AI will be used sparingly in clinical practice during the next five years and then extensively over the next decade."

The advances in hardware and the democratization of software tools have revolutionized machine learning. However, the deployment of ML models -- the mathematical representation of the task to be performed -- for effective and efficient clinical decision support at the point of care is still a challenge. ML models undergo constant improvement of their accuracy and predictive power with a high turnover rate. Updating models consumed by downstream health information systems is essential for patient safety. We introduce a functional taxonomy and a four-tier architecture for cloud-based model deployment for digital health. The four tiers are containerized microservices for maintainability, serverless architecture for scalability, function as a service for portability and FHIR schema for discoverability. We call this architecture Serverless on FHIR and propose this as a standard to deploy digital health applications that can be consumed by downstream systems such as EMRs and visualization tools.","proposed framework is based on technologies that are currently available. The turnover time for technological innovations in ML is short. In the future, browser-based ML and on-device and edge computing may become more frequent, and need for cloud deployments may become less critical . Discussion:
 There is an increasing emphasis by healthcare providers on patient-centred solutions enabling patients to make informed decisions. ML is popular in pre-clinical research, and recent advances in drug discovery and bioinformatics rely on ML algorithms . Discussion:
 The time to characterize genes and develop lab tests and vaccines has been greatly reduced, as seen in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is growing discontent in the clinical community that their participation has not been encouraged . Discussion:
 Many of the ML algorithms developed for clinical decision making are only available to a few, and efficient ML deployments may reduce this disparity. FHIR, as an interoperability solution, has gained wide acceptance, which is why we adopted FHIR as the backbone of our deployment framework. Discussion:
 We have extended BI deployment guidelines  to eHealth but have refrained from offering any new standard. We hope that the Serverless on FHIR that we propose will evolve and mature into a standard, with a focus on serving clinicians. ML and AI have resulted in several innovative applications in medicine. Discussion:
 But many of these innovations need support to scale from computer labs to the bedside. Traditionally, deployment of ML models has received less attention than model building. Discussion:
 We have proposed a taxonomy of ML models and a set of deployment principles to bridge the gap between researchers who build innovative healthcare models and implementation engineers who make them available at the point of patient care."

 AI terminology can be confusing. Here are a few important definitions, as listed by Merriam-Webster  (www.merriam-webster.com). AI 101:
 • Artificial intelligence: a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers AI 101:
 • Machine learning: the process by which a computer is able to improve its own performance (as in analyzing image files) by continuously incorporating new data into an existing statistical model AI 101:

Big Potential:
 Moore is far from the only person who believes in the potential of AI for the healthcare setting: Big Potential:

A report on the survey ndings stated that although AI has certainly seen its fair share of ""hype,"" it's already making an impact on healthcare, with new uses for AI being tested all the time. Use cases for AI include new CMMSs that deploy AI algorithms to assist with capital equipment planning and electronic health record (EHR) systems that use AI-enabled tools to support data collection and clinical note taking. One company, Eko, a maker of digital stethoscopes, has developed an AI algorithm that can detect pediatric heart murmurs with accuracy rivaling that of trained cardiologists. A rm in China is using AI software to automatically pinpoint polyps during colonoscopies. In addition, GE Healthcare announced the launch of an ""intelligence platform"" called Edison.

Another area of AI approaches is represented by early prediction of diabetic micro-and macrovascular complications in people with both T1D and T2D. Nonsupervised methods have been used to identify clusters of T2D patients, with a similarity-based stratification approach to the characterization of this type of subject. ML has been used to predict microvascular complications of T2D, exploiting EHR data and to forecast them with administrative data only. Finally, another area where AI methods can be used is to identify subjects at risk of developing diabetes and allow a timely diagnosis. ML models have been applied to distinguish between healthy subjects and those with prediabetes based on CGM-derived glycemic variability indices. Dynamic probabilistic models have been also studied to describe and predict diabetes onset relying only on common risk factors, such as obesity, lifestyle, or hypertension.

The development of mobile applications that use mobile devices to monitor human functions is no longer sufficient. It is necessary to develop software to manage big data, in order to facilitate the transfer of health status with regard to specific groups of patients. Implementation of the healthcare IoT:
 How can health systems provide smart global connectivity? The answer to this question might lie in promoting the development of new digital-health companies. The main characteristics of such companies must be that they have integrated innovation in their DNA. For the development of such companies, financing from health insurance alone will not be enough. It will be necessary to ask who will pay for the digitalisation of the health service and application development? The solution may lie in the development of national open innovation platforms that should be financed and steered by national health systems. Such platforms must hold healthcare data and standardised claims records, and provide data access for application programming interfaces, as well as common technical IT services, such as identity, access, and consent management. Open innovation platform need to be able to support healthcare systems to decrease costs. In accordance with the intention of the development platform, the stakeholders must define the distribution of the benefits . Implementation of the healthcare IoT:
 The IoT play an important role in reshaping the healthcare industry from a supply-oriented model to a demand-oriented one. In the classical healthcare system, patients (consumers) do not have control and have little or no information about the cost and quality of care. The new business model should thus allow customers to pursue perceived value and to seek resources for taking control over their own health. Implementation of the healthcare IoT:
 The success of the new healthcare delivery model depends on combinations of the following factors, based on the integrated virtual cycle of innovations (Figure ): Implementation of the healthcare IoT:
 Self-health control and assessment of the health condition: the patient (customer) is updated on his or her health condition in real-time. To establishment the IoT, technology companies could set up a circuit between the customer and smart healthcare medical teams through 1 radio frequency identification (RFID) 2 WSNs 3 middleware 4 cloud computing 5 IoT application software . Implementation of the healthcare IoT:
 Such a system could operate with the help of both people and artificial intelligence. Implementation of the healthcare IoT:
 Transparent healthcare users' market: the evolutionary role of IoT technology is that allows the consumer access to resources such as network-based crowd. Consumers are creating personal markets and making their own healthcare decisions and are involved directly (B2C) with healthcare institutions.

A classification model is developed using a dataset of patients diagnosed with T2DM and healthy controls, incorporating feature selection techniques. The model will be trained and tested on machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy in detecting T2DM, with an accuracy of 98%.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP:
 promising with their results, it is still a challenge to practice these methods in real-time for clinical diagnosis. The main reason is that AI needs a large amount of data to work with, and this requires time. In the case of AI, this is called data transfer learning. And it means that you need a large amount of labeled data to train your algorithm with. Moreover, the results may again vary based on the data collected from a geographic location such as Asia Pacific, USA, and European regions. III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP:
 The datasets available on open-source platforms are outdated and don't meet the expected results as the prediction needs to be dynamic, which means based on the patient's current reports. Also, the results will vary based on the top features or attributes selected during the process of feature selection. III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP:
 The challenge of building a machine learning model is that it requires extensive data, which is often not available in the medical field. Therefore, there are limitations to building a model based on the available data. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Our research presents compelling results on the detection of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using feature selection algorithms. Through the utilization of carefully curated datasets, we employed various algorithms to assess the probability of individuals having T2D. The evaluation of our results was based on performance metrics such as prediction, F1-score, recall, and accuracy, which are presented in Table . IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Fig.  highlights the notable findings of our study, emphasizing the significant improvement in T2D prediction accuracy achieved by addressing imbalanced datasets using feature selection techniques. The Confusion Matrix visually represents the superior performance of our approach, clearly demonstrating the enhanced accuracy obtained through our methodology. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Of particular interest is the remarkable performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, outperforming other algorithms examined in our study. This discovery holds great promise for the healthcare industry, as our proposed model proves to be cost-effective and efficient in terms of implementation time. Unlike traditional diagnostic tests such as Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), our model eliminates the need for expensive lab reagents and specialized skills. This breakthrough paves the way for early detection of diabetes, especially in remote areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Looking ahead, the integration of 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies offers even more potential for improving healthcare outcomes. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, the latency at the edge can be significantly reduced, enabling real-time data analysis and decision-making. This cognitive system architecture represents the inception of a smart healthcare system, empowering remote areas and underserved communities with access to timely and accurate diabetes detection."

Introduction:
 Globally, chronic care conditions burden society with high costs and diminished quality of life for affected individuals. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one in 10 Americans ha diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as type-2 diabetes (T2DM), and approximately one in three has prediabetes. Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2017. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures 2.3 times higher than those without diabetes , and 25% of all medical costs in the United States are spent on caring for people with diabetes. Diabetes can result in disabling complications, comorbidities, and reduced life expectancy. Effective management of diabetes is important to improve the quality of life for diabetics as well as improve population health and control medical costs. Attention and interventions are needed to address the issue of rising costs. Clinical decision support systems (CDSs) may offer the solution to rising costs, quality of care, patient engagement, patient-centered care, personalized medicine, clinical inertia, and clinical outcomes. Introduction:
 According to KBVResearch, the global CDSs market will grow from 2.9 billion in 2017 to 8.9 billion in 2027 . The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) and CDSs has been on the rise across the globe. Developed countries lead the development and implementation of CDSs. Several factors contribute to the increased acceptance and adoption of CDSs: general acceptance of using technologies across the entire healthcare spectrum, including adherence to clinical guidelines, evidence of improved clinic outcomes, government incentives, compliance/regulatory requirements, and operational efficiency. In this book chapter, we provide an overview of recent evidence on CDSs for diabetes care by searching relevant publications in CINAL, PsychInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, and PubMed from 2017 to the present. Clinical decision support systems for diabetes care 2.1 Diabetes care:
 Diabetes is a chronic disease. Adequate diabetes care requires attention to biomarkers such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar level, and lifestyle changes. Care typically involves management of blood pressure, lipids, smoking, glucose, weight, screening for eye, foot, renal and vascular complications, and immunizations. It is common that patients with diabetes also have one or more other comorbid conditions. Thus, caring for diabetics is a team effort, and many providers may be involved, including various types of physicians or nurse practitioners, pharmacists, case managers, dieticians, and specialty doctors such as cardiologists, dentists, ophthalmologists, others. The literature has consistently reported a gap between current diabetes care practice and recommended diabetes care standards. This includes the concept of clinical inertia or the failure to start or accelerate a current or new therapy when appropriate. Clinical inertia may be due to the clinician's lack of knowledge or inexperience with new therapeutic interventions and drugs available to treat diabetes ."

Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled systems developed for high-throughput detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using digitized retinal images have become clinically adopted. This study reviews AI applications using retinal images for DM-related complications, highlighting advancements beyond DR screening, diagnosis, and prognosis, and addresses implementation challenges, such as ethics, data privacy, equitable access, and explainability. We conducted a thorough literature search across several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies involving diabetes, the retina, and artificial intelligence. We reviewed the original research based on their methodology, AI algorithms, data processing techniques, and validation procedures to ensure a detailed analysis of AI applications in diabetic retinal imaging. Retinal images can be used to diagnose DM complications including DR, neuropathy, nephropathy, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as well as to predict the risk of cardiovascular events. Beyond DR screening, AI integration also offers significant potential to address the challenges in the comprehensive care of patients with DM. With the ability to evaluate the patient’s health status in relation to DM complications as well as risk prognostication of future cardiovascular complications, AI-assisted retinal image analysis has the potential to become a central tool for modern personalized medicine in patients with DM.","robustness that can be applied to diverse tasks, including DR detection, retinal lesion identification, and retinal vessel segmentation . Challenges of AI in diabetes care: Only two Asian countries have DR screening programs that conform to International Council of Ophthalmology standards . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 There is not only an imperative to standardize national protocols to mitigate gaps in screening and referral timelines  but also a need to establish comprehensive guidelines for AI implementation in DR screening to ensure standardized and effective practice  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 AI-enabled DR screening can reduce economic constraints and enhance accessibility to healthcare services  , but several obstacles remain to surmount  . Overcoming these challenges will require multidisciplinary cooperation, data standardization, resource sharing, real-world verification, and productization  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 In particular, DL algorithms require large datasets with thousands or millions of images for training, which are costly to label and curate. Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 AI developers often resort to using available but limited training datasets, which may not be generalizable to the real world, where image quality may be affected by deficiencies in the clinical setting and are not of consistently high quality  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Suboptimal image quality and low target pathology incidence may drive higher false-positive rates  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Even if image issues are resolved, AI algorithms that only focus on retinal image assessment will not be able to analyze the clinical and psychosocial aspects that can modulate the diagnosis, perception, coping mechanisms, and holistic management of individual patients  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 The lack of compatibility among electronic health record vendors impedes such clinical data integration and may delay the execution of computerinterpretable guidelines for clinical decision-making in DR  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 To garner wider adoption, there is a need for more research on the assessment and testing of AI diagnostic tools in clinical settings  , even as validating AI algorithms in different populations and camera systems remains challenging  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Additionally, conducting rigorous clinical trials of AI models, particularly randomized controlled trials, requires meticulous methodological adjustments and considerations of clinical equipoise, informed consent, and fairness  . Practical challenges to building and deploying AI at scale include regulatory pressures, conflicting business goals, and data quality issues  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Even as AI promises solutions to problems through technological advances, AI in healthcare raises ethical and legal issues  . As AI systems , become more autonomous  the need to incorporate ethical considerations and moral reasoning into model decision-making processes has become more pressing. Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Equally important is the obligation to identify and resolve ethical issues-inclusivity, bias, and social acceptability-to ensure fair user access to promising healthcare AI technologies  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Issues such as protecting sensitive medical information during image analysis or remote sharing via tele-retinal screening 147 also raise patient privacy concerns, requiring careful system security during AI solution development and deployment. Challenges of AI in diabetes care:
 Current approaches to AI model design are delinked mainly from the complex healthcare environments they are intended for; as a result, the development of AI models has vastly outpaced their adoption into existing clinical workflows  . Challenges of AI in diabetes care:

"The Promise of Clinical Decision Support Systems Targetting Low-Resource Settings","https://scispace.com/paper/the-promise-of-clinical-decision-support-systems-targetting-3vukr8yf","2022","Journal Article","IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","","10.1109/rbme.2020.3017868","https://scispace.com/pdf/the-promise-of-clinical-decision-support-systems-targetting-3vukr8yf.pdf","Low-resource clinical settings are plagued by low physician-to-patient ratios and a shortage of high-quality medical expertise and infrastructure. Together, these phenomena lead to over-burdened healthcare systems that under-serve the needs of the community. Alleviating this burden can be undertaken by the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs); systems that support stakeholders (ranging from physicians to patients) within the clinical setting in their day-to-day activities. Such systems, which have proven to be effective in the developed world, remain to be under-explored in low-resource settings. This review attempts to summarize the research focused on clinical decision support systems that either target stakeholders within low-resource clinical settings or diseases commonly found in such environments. When categorizing our findings according to disease applications, we find that CDSSs are predominantly focused on dealing with bacterial infections and maternal care, do not leverage deep learning, and have not been evaluated prospectively. Together, these highlight the need for increased research in this domain in order to impact a diverse set of medical conditions and ultimately improve patient outcomes. ","2 and QRisk2 scores . C. Clinical Implementation: Few clinical algorithms and support systems have been translated into clinical practice. To increase this translation rate, algorithms need to be assessed for their reliability on various patient populations and evaluated in a prospective manner. C. Clinical Implementation:
 1) Reliability: Algorithms identified in this review were predominantly evaluated on a specific subset of patients from a certain division within the clinical setting e.g. intensive care unit. Consequently, we identified the need for increased evaluation of such models in their ability to generalize. Reliable models can be thought of as those that perform equally well (generalize) on diverse patient populations from different clinical settings but also those that remain robust over time. In other words, they also perform equally well among the same patient population at different timepoints in the future. From this perspective, there is a scarcity of algorithms in the literature, both in the developed and developing world, that are evaluated according to the aforementioned notions of generalizability. For instance, Wiens et al.  attempt to leverage data from multiple hospitals to make hospital-specific predictions, whereas Oh et al.  attempt to predict infection rates at two large hospitals. The importance of generalizability was recently emphasized by the Food and Drug Administration's white paper on regulating machine learning based systems . C. Clinical Implementation:
 2) Prospective Evaluation: Our findings illustrated that decision support systems were predominantly evaluated retrospectively. To determine the utility of such systems, they would need to be evaluated prospectively. Globally, few initiatives are attempting to do so. For instance, Wong et al.  prospectively evaluate the impact of a medication decision support system within an ICU setting by measuring the rate of patient adverse drug reactions due to recommendation over-rides by physicians. Another example is GP at Hand, a system that has partnered with the NHS to help connect patients with physicians through a mobile-application and provides them with a medical history to make informed decisions . In tackling acute-kidney injury, Connell et al.  evaluated Streams, a mobile-application focused on streamlining the treatment process within a hospital setting, citing reduced time to recognize the injury. Several of the aforementioned examples are mobile-applications, potentially lessening the need for expensive medical infrastructure within a clinical setting. This would be ideal for implementation in low-resource settings. VI. CONCLUSION:
 This review has summarized the publications focused on clinical decision support systems targetting stakeholders and medical conditions within low-resource clinical settings. Despite the significant burden of a wide array of diseases on such regions, the majority of the publications discuss systems aimed at dealing with bacterial infections and maternal/fetal care. This implies that greater emphasis needs to be placed on under-treated diseases such as sepsis and non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, very few of the support systems reviewed were evaluated prospectively and in randomized-control trials, the gold-standard for determining clinical utlity. By elucidating these shortcomings, this review hopes to encourage the future development and evaluation of algorithms in low-resource clinical settings with the overall aim of improving patient outcomes.

 Due to various challenging issues, such as computational complexity, Edge Computing is a disruptive and promising solution that pushes substantial processing and storage resources from the network core to the network edge, close to mobile devices or sensors. In particular, AI on Edge is emerging as a new paradigm to leverage medical devices and applications, connected to remote (and potentially distributed) Hospital Information System (HIS) through the Internet. Its pervasive diffusion is promoted by the massive usage of smart and wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) communication technologies in the healthcare domain. Background and Related Work:

Recent advances in diabetes technology after integration of CSII with CGM have increased the popularity of this treatment modality in pediatric age and shifted the standard diabetes management in many countries. We found an impressive transition from the use of CSII and/or CGM only to integrative devices with automated delivery systems. Although much has changed over the past 5 years, including a pandemic period that precipitated a broader use of telemedicine in diabetes care, some advances in technology may still be an additional burden of care for providers, patients, and caregivers.

 The broader use of the newest diabetes technologies made intensive treatment easier to achieve as diabetes management steps forward to be more patient centered. Apart from technological advances and greater patient satisfaction, and although insulin remains the mainstay of diabetes treatment, results are only better when diabetes care becomes primarily patient-dependent or, in the case of young children, the family assumes this management supported by the multidisciplinary team.

With the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI), e-health initiatives in Saudi Arabia are increasing, which is compelling academics, clinicians, and policymakers to develop a better understanding of e-health trends, their efficacy, and their high impact areas. An increase in the number of diabetic patients in the Kingdom demands improvements to the current e-health care system, where the capability to manage diabetic patients is still in its infancy. In this survey, a total of 210 valid responses were obtained for analysis. SPSS version 27.0 was used for the quantitative analysis. The main technique used to address the aims of the data analysis was Spearman’s correlation analysis. This study indicated that the compliance rate with prescribed medication, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin injections from hospitals is increasing, with the highest rates found for Jeddah City. However, diet control and physical activity compliance levels were found to be poorly combined, predominantly due to the lower number of registered patients in the e-health care system. This non-compliance trends with selected variables (education and income) and highlights the dire need for improvement to the current health system by the inclusion of the latest technology, including big data, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Hence, this study suggests the implementation of government-regulated e-health care systems on mobile-based policies. The study revealed the experience of patients using e-health systems, which could be used to improve their efficacy and durability. More research needs to be conducted to address the deficiencies in the current e-health care system regarding diabetes care, and how it can be integrated into the healthcare system in general.","location feature of smart devices. Based on the experiences of developed countries, such as the US and Australia, e-health or m-health apps can be declared valid tools for diabetes self-management, since the US government has already approved the use of such applications . Literature Survey:
 The clinical decision support system (CDSS) significantly improves the overall process of self-care and patient outcomes (20%) . For verified results and medication error prevention, reliable evidence based on the impact of the CDSS on patient self-care is required. This reporting inefficiency can be overcome with the inclusion of patient feedback on outcome indicators and educational information, combined with case management, which seems to be the most effective strategy (i.e., the chronic care model) . Artificial Intelligence and Self Compliance in Diabetic Patients:
 Artificial intelligence (AI) has a variety of applications in e-health and is gradually changing the dimensions of medical practice. Machine learning (ML) can also help healthcare organisations meet growing medical demands, improve operations, and lower costs. With the introduction of the latest methods of data acquisition, AI applications have been utilised in areas that were ignored earlier. Since ML derives patterns from the given data, these innovations can help healthcare practitioners detect and treat diseases more efficiently and with more precision and personalised care for patients . Since AI mimics human cognitive functions, it has brought a paradigm shift to the healthcare sector because of the progress in analytics techniques . In recent times, since AI has been embedded into devices such as smartwatches, it has proved to be of great help in tracking medical conditions via blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels. In diabetic patients, such devices help monitor the heart rate, thus assisting in avoiding coronary artery disease. Diabetic patients are more prone to heart disease, such as heart attacks or stroke, and require constant monitoring . AI can potentially affect and improve three major dimensions of diabetes care: e-health care systems, health workers, and diabetes patients (see Figure ). such devices help monitor the heart rate, thus assisting in avoiding coronary artery disease. Diabetic patients are more prone to heart disease, such as heart attacks or stroke, and require constant monitoring . AI can potentially affect and improve three major dimensions of diabetes care: e-health care systems, health workers, and diabetes patients (see Figure ). Another important aspect of self-care in diabetes management is exercise. AI can help patents meet their exercise requirements, since AI in devices such as smartwatches can count the number of steps walked or miles run. Appropriate hours of sleep are important for diabetic patients, and a feature of all wearable devices is the ability to track sleep cycles. Making smart use of AI, a diabetic patient can track his or her calorie intake and eating habits and follow meal plans, which are otherwise very difficult to manage . Artificial Intelligence and Self Compliance in Diabetic Patients:
 Applying the theory of preventive care and easy disease detection, the implementation of AI in healthcare is cost-effective because it helps patients detect potential hazards sooner, and thus reduces patients' overall healthcare expenditure. A diabetic patient can improve his or her health condition by implementing AI in his or her healthcare schedule ."

After examining the problems, they developed a clinically-based, integrated monitoring system centred on primary care. IoT healthcare applications:
 Close monitoring of IoT applications is another feature of IoT services. New methods have been developed to create a healthcare system framework that can manage and analyse data from electronic health records (EHRs) and medical images. It's evident that app development is focused on the services required, and it's not a big surprise that sick people and other users rely on apps. It follows that whereas apps are tailored to the needs of end users, services focus on what the developer can provide. Emotion detection in functional technologies, accident intensity prediction in severe injuries, and effectively evaluating alcoholics are only few of the latest applications that have employed different ML algorithms in similar ways. IoT healthcare applications:
 Research and development efforts have focused extensively on IoT-driven healthcare systems and technology, including how the IoT may aid with paediatric and geriatric care, chronic illness tracking, individual wellbeing and activity management, and more. The numerous pieces of technology, wearables, and healthcare instruments now available on the market were also explored in the research. These novel healthcare products and tools might be viewed as an example of the inventiveness and originality of the Internet of Things in delivering various forms of medical assistance. The many single-and multi-condition IoT-based healthcare applications are discussed in the following sections. Table  provides a synopsis of IoT-based sensors in healthcare applications and other use cases and deployments. Healthcare implementations using smart device requests:
 There has been a recent uptick in the production of electrical gadgets that are controlled by sensors sent from smart smartphones. Because of this shift, smart gadgets are becoming the primary forces behind the Internet of Things. Implementing quality service standards like flawlessness, dependability, and cross-device portability necessitates integrating IoT with specialised disciplines . Smart devices have become a helpful instrument in the delivery of medical care as a result of the development of a variety of software applications and hardware items that are compatible with smart devices. In-depth research was conducted, and the characteristics of health apps and how they interact with those of smart devices were laid out in methodical detail . The article covered topics including patient-focused apps and health apps in general. Apps that can aid in patient education, training, and information were also explored; these and other similar apps are referred to as auxiliary requests. Healthcare implementations using smart device requests:
 The following medical issues might be conveniently checked and diagnosed using the tools already available on smart devices. In addition, technological progress aids medical professionals in making correct diagnoses and providing effective treatment. It might be used to tell the difference between emergencies requiring immediate care (such as trips to the emergency department) and chronic conditions requiring complex management. Patients with severe cases of diabetes can have a wide range of complications. Asthma attacks, severe respiratory tract obstructions, allergic rhinitis, and other nasal-related symptoms might influence the lungs, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation in the blood, skin, and immune system ."

Another area of AI approaches is represented by early prediction of diabetic micro-and macrovascular complications in people with both T1D and T2D. Nonsupervised methods have been used to identify clusters of T2D patients, with a similarity-based stratification approach to the characterization of this type of subject. ML has been used to predict microvascular complications of T2D, exploiting EHR data and to forecast them with administrative data only. Finally, another area where AI methods can be used is to identify subjects at risk of developing diabetes and allow a timely diagnosis. ML models have been applied to distinguish between healthy subjects and those with prediabetes based on CGM-derived glycemic variability indices. Dynamic probabilistic models have been also studied to describe and predict diabetes onset relying only on common risk factors, such as obesity, lifestyle, or hypertension. This latter approach provides an explainable model that seems particularly interesting in a safety critical context as medicine. In summary, AI provides great opportunities for diabetes diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, but there are open issues: (1) ML methods need large and curated datasets, which are not always available; (2) some recent AI models are difficult to interpret; (3) a data-driven model can poorly generalize when new data from different clinical contexts are collected; (4) safety must be ensured; and (5) integration with human intelligence and clinical workflow is essential.

Method: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies reporting evaluation of AI in clinical settings from January 2021 to December 2022. We documented the clinical application areas and tasks supported, and the level of system autonomy. Reported effects on user experience, decision-making, care delivery and outcomes were summarised. Results: AI technologies are being applied in a wide variety of clinical areas. Most contemporary systems utilise deep learning, use routinely collected data, support diagnosis and triage, are assistive (requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions), and are used by doctors in acute care settings in high-income nations. AI systems are integrated and used within existing clinical information systems including electronic medical records. There is limited support for One Health goals. Evaluation is largely based on quantitative methods measuring effects on decision-making. Conclusion: AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas.

Importantly, it enables safety and efficacy to be assessed ahead of expensive clinical deployment . Discussion:
 Other studies reported strategies to incorporate well-known considerations for the use of digital health technologies such as ensuring that AI advice was actionable (e.g., when algorithms were designed to operationalise national guidelines ), and integrated into clinical workflow and existing CISs including EHRs (e.g., ). Discussion:
 In one study where the AI was not integrated into the EHRs, general practitioners needed to enter patient characteristics into a web-based version of the AI . Discussion:
 A key challenge for system implementation is to build upon general considerations for digital health and identify specific measures required for the safe and effective use of ML algorithms. Discussion:
 For instance, Schwartz et al. applied the human-computer trust conceptual framework to specifically examine trust around machine learned predictions of in-hospital deterioration ; Calisto et al. used the human-AI design guidelines to inform implementation of a breast screening AI into clinical workflow . Discussion:
 Another example is Jordan et al.'s study of the effects of cultural embeddedness on AI implementation in ED nursing triage . Discussion:
 Further work is also required to advance the goals of One Health via collaboration between the digital health and One Health communities . Discussion:
 Indeed, the One Health approach may help to move technology-driven AI beyond doctors in well-resourced acute care settings towards problem-driven systems addressing areas of specific clinical need and to improve equity in provision of health services . Examples of such AI were evident in the studies we reviewed. Discussion:
 For example, use of progressive web applications to migrate a pneumonia mortality prediction tool from a study prototype to a mobile app for a resource-constrained context was implemented in Gambia . Discussion:
 Another example is the use of non-clinical data such as traffic volume and socioeconomic status for predicting the risk of asthma exacerbations . Discussion:
 Other problem-driven examples include dermatology apps specifically developed for people of colour , a radiology examination instruction system to support COVID-19 triage in a predominantly Spanish-speaking Latino community , and AI systems for trainee clinicians . Conclusions:
 This survey confirms that AI systems are being implemented and evaluated in many clinical areas. Most systems are assistive, requiring users to confirm or approve AI provided information or decisions. Conclusions:
 Study designs are largely quantitative measuring effects on decision-making, and there remain many opportunities to understand patterns of routine use and evaluate effects on care delivery and patient outcomes using mixed-methods. There is also a need to study the immediate and long-term effects of automation on human performance. Conclusions:
 No doubt newer generative AI that have potential to improve user interaction and reduce the burden associated with CISs need to be carefully evaluated as they come with their own risks that need to be managed. Conclusions:

 'Diabetes' is a term used to describe a group of diseases characterised by elevated blood glucose levels. It is caused by a lack of insulin production or function, or both, which may occur for various reasons and lead to protein and lipid metabolic disorders.  Various scientific studies have established that adequate blood glucose regulation minimises the longterm effects of type 2 diabetes. Increasing inclination towards technology provides an opportunity for the delivery of innovative self-management interventions. The global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to rise, with T2DM estimated to affect over 9% of the global population by 2035.  The use of mobile health (mHealth) tools to help people manage chronic diseases is on the rise, but evidence of their effectiveness is mixed.  An overview and a scoping review were conducted to understand the impact of mHealth interventions among patients with chronic diabetes and showed improving glycaemic control using diverse mHealth interventions.  Another trial proved to have improved behavioural outcomes among diabetic individuals.  People with diabetes are increasingly using mobile technology for health (mHealth) interventions to help improve self-management; however, these interventions have not been implemented by many patients, and dropout rates are common. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY:
 ⇒ Effectiveness of using mobile health (mHealth) apps on HbA1c levels. ⇒ Adherence to mHealth applications and positive behavioural outcomes will be evaluated. ⇒ The exclusion of articles in languages other than English and articles behind a paywall. ⇒ The geographical area of the study will be limited to low and middle-income countries. Open access:
 Type 2 diabetes in low and middle-income countries A slew of issues plague the delivery of healthcare in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), where four out of every five people with diabetes now live in these countries, and the rate of diabetes is increasing in poorer communities.  In 57 developing countries, WHO estimates a 4.3 million healthcare worker shortage, resulting in understaffed hospitals, limited patient access to care and a significant patient-physician contact gap, especially in rural areas.  To bridge this gap in terms of diabetes management, self-management apps can play a pivotal role in India and the LMICs. To understand how mHealth apps aid in diabetes management, knowing what is meant by eHealth is important. Open access:

 The healthcare industry faces pressing challenges, including inefficient systems, suboptimal decisions, and strained physician-patient relationships.  This situation has led to substantial interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to improve healthcare quality, access, and delivery. Introduction:
 AI collectively refers to computational techniques that enable systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decisionmaking. By analyzing complex medical datasets beyond human capabilities, AI has the potential to transform clinical care and healthcare operations. Introduction:
 However, realizing AI's full potential in enhancing health outcomes necessitates grappling with the complex practical barriers and risks involved in integrating these rapidly evolving technologies into embedded healthcare workflows, systems, and practices. Introduction:
 For instance, AI-powered mobile health applications have the potential to provide vital healthcare information and services in remote areas, addressing the challenges of diverse healthcare systems globally. Introduction:
 These applications can leverage machine learning, cloud computing, and wearable technologies to gather and analyze health data, detect diseases, and improve healthcare prediction systems. The integration of health services into technologybased systems, such as mobile health applications, offers convenience and better health services for individuals and healthcare personnel. Introduction:
 Additionally, the use of AI algorithms in healthcare can aid in diagnosis, drug development, personalized medicine, patient monitoring, and care. However, it is important to consider the positive and negative effects of mobile health applications, especially regarding privacy and trust. Introduction:
 By developing adaptable AI solutions that consider the challenges and needs of diverse healthcare systems, as discussed recently in-depth by Wang and Preininger 8 and Chakraborty et al  these applications can have a transformative impact on healthcare access and outcomes globally. Introduction:
 Understanding and addressing these varied global needs is crucial for the responsible and effective implementation of AI in healthcare worldwide. Introduction:
 This perspective paper aims to provide an in-depth and balanced analysis of the major opportunities as well as the risks and challenges associated with effectively incorporating AI capabilities into healthcare environments. Introduction:
 It integrates insights from emerging evidence regarding AI applications in medicine, drawing from research studies, expert opinions, and real-world examples of AI implementation in healthcare settings. Introduction:
 By critically evaluating the evidence and considering both the potential benefits and limitations of AI in healthcare, this paper offers a measured perspective on how healthcare organizations can tap the transformative potential of AI while proactively addressing its pitfalls and unintended consequences. Introduction:
 Understanding and addressing these varied global needs is crucial for the responsible and effective implementation of AI in healthcare worldwide. Administrative Burdens in Healthcare:
 Healthcare administrators face steadily growing clerical burdens from excessive documentation, coding, insurance approvals, and other regulatory requirements that detract from direct patient care activities. Administrative Burdens in Healthcare:
 According to some estimates, for every hour spent on direct face-to-face patient care, physicians spend nearly two hours on electronic health record (EHR) and desk work related to administrative responsibilities.  Such burdens are a key contributor to widespread physician burnout, which in turn exacerbates the strain on patient-physician relationships and the overall quality of care delivery."

This analysis will help to identify, understand, and evaluate key aspects of the technology as well as the various internal/external forces which influence its success in this application space. Such understanding is instrumental to ensure judicial planning and implementation with suitable safeguards being considered. AI has the potential to radically change how respiratory disease management is conducted and may help clinicians to realise new treatment paradigms. The application of AI is clearly not specific to respiratory disease management; however it is a chronic disease that requires on-going monitoring and well evidenced decision making regarding treatment pathways or medication modification. This work emphasises the current position of AI as applied to respiratory disease management and identifies the issues to help develop strategic directions to ensure successful implementation, evidenced by ubiquitous acceptance and uptake.","principle has been proven already with smart implanted insulin pumps which actively monitor blood glucose levels and automatically medicate to exacting levels accordingly . Further emerging technologies such as stretchable electronics and long range low power communication systems increase the potential for effective technology deployment. Threats:
 The literature shows limited work on AI and telemetry for respiratory disease monitoring  which means it is not as well understood as some other areas of study. However, some key explorations on the use of machine learning for respiratory disease diagnosis in clinical settings serve to effectively highlight the value of developing the technology . Other external threats may impede the uptake of AI for respiratory disease management including the fear of lawsuits against the system creator if AI is proven to have made a poor judgement or an obvious mistake. Likewise, the over-expectation of investors, technical communities and medical professionals, fears over security of data and hacking, poor investment into the technology, user error of any aspect of the system, issues with poor battery performance for portable devices, and global economics which demands continual cost cutting will all serve to threaten successful adoption of the technology. High profile figures such as the late Professor Stephen Hawking have done little to help the public perception of AI . Furthermore the notoriously slow uptake of new technology in healthcare  may result in the technology being quickly outdated, especially in the context of AI technology changing so rapidly. Threats:
 A notable high profile AI failure will no doubt cast a long shadow over the trust of AI implementation for some time; in March 2018 an autonomous car being driven by AI was involved in a fatal pedestrian accident . Internet commentators reasoned that the outcome would have been the same regardless of whether a computer or a person was under control of the vehicle, nonetheless the headline will still capture the imagination of those already fearful of machines making life and death decisions. These issues are real and cannot be overcome easily; objections will remain and as such the technology could struggle to enjoy widespread acceptance without significant research and validation of medical AI systems. While automotive AI applications are clearly distinct from healthcare applications the public perception may not be adequately informed to appreciate the different techniques and technologies utilised. CONCLUSIONS:
 The potential for impact and reduced costs for respiratory disease management is clear, however there are also significant obstacles to implementation and the approval processes in healthcare could make the new technology lag behind AI implementation in other sectors; healthcare could therefore be the last sector to experience the benefits of the IoT/AI revolution. Correct implementation however will fundamentally enable fast reactions to emergencies in the short term and disease progression management in the long term. It will also have the capacity to address the increased management complications presented by multiple chronic conditions (MCC). CONCLUSIONS:
 Non-medical devices purporting to contain AI may serve to impede authorised application in clinical practice as if these consumer electronics lifestyle devices are of questionable trustworthiness they may complicate acceptance of AI in automated healthcare decision making. General recommendations for well-managed implementation includes ensuring the technology is not hurried to meet industry expectations, the use of valid training datasets taken from a cross section of communities and diseases, ongoing healthcare cost evaluations, and the acknowledgement that AI is still in its infancy and has significant maturing to do before being ready for such an audacious task."

In addressing the first research question, which sought to establish the state of research on the application of 4IR technologies within healthcare systems of LMICs, the authors have put together a coherent picture of how 4IR technology is finding application in various healthcare areas, including EHR, Healthcare Information Systems, diagnostics, telehealth and mHealth. This study has also revealed that, to date, there has only been limited application of 4IR technologies in healthcare systems of LMICs. It has been established that although some 4IR technologies, such as Systems Integration, Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Automation and Robotics have found some application within LMIC healthcare systems, others including Digital Twin and Simulation, Blockchain, Virtual Reality, IoT and Cloud Computing have remained largely unexploited. We have established the trend of how the research areas have evolved over time and shown where things are now, as well as pointed out the most likely future research directions. We have also presented the leading journals that are publishing in the research area, together with the leading research studies. Despite the limited application of 4IR technologies within the health sectors of LMICs, it has been noted that these digital tools have resulted in improved health outcomes where they have been applied. We have established that 4IR technologies have helped address challenges related to a constrained infrastructure and low capacity, improved access to healthcare particularly for rural populations, and through technologies such as remote sensing and disease surveillance, helped improve the quality of primary healthcare. However, it has also emerged that, hitherto, most studies have only focused on application of 4IR technologies to solve disease specific problems, so-called digital health solutions, and that there is not yet enough work that considers the holistic improvement of entire healthcare systems. We have therefore highlighted the many opportunities that exist for LMICs to leverage 4IR technologies in order to address their health systems challenges including digital twin, simulation, blockchain, cybersecurity and EHR. The final research question sought to identify the major challenges that health systems of LMICs still face that application of specific 4IR technologies may help tackle. In this regard, we identified that there are still significant opportunities for the application of 4IR tools such as simulation and digital twin, cloud computing and cybersecurity in solving persistent healthcare challenges within LMICs. These challenges include limited access to healthcare for poorer populations, privacy and security risks, as well as a lack of systems optimisation. The use of smart technologies to develop, for example, a digital model (digital twin-symbiotic simulation) of a hospital's healthcare delivery system, will likely improve system integration and thereby enhance optimisation of healthcare delivery in low-and middle-income countries. Furthermore, governments could invest in IomT for specific demographics, for example, in the elderly, or for patients requiring chronic care such as cancer, hypertension and diabetes, as well as mental illness. Even healthy populations could benefit from IomT use for routine check-ups and proactive monitoring as well as to inform health policy. It is hoped that governments, health practitioners and researchers are persuaded and assured of the gains that stand to be made from investing further work and effort in this area of digital technology applications in healthcare."

This paper discusses these aligned ideas in view of their value to translational design processes. The ideas embedded in these two approaches are considered in the light of critical questions associated with the development of health informatics. Health care processes for patients might be very fragmented. Synergy thinking is required in all areas of design: it is crucial to understand the theoretical frames and issues associated with focus environments, administration, and cost policy. By internalizing common nuances in these approaches, designers can ease the interaction and communication between experts from different backgrounds. Synergistic thinking aids designers in health informatics to produce more sophisticated products. Maturing in recognizing the whole aids to take into account ""the very essentials"" more easily. These skills are very vital in prioritizing development substances in health informatics area.","mobile phone of an estimated consultancy time. Innovations in health informatics can change health care structures radically and in a cost-effective manner if this potential is used rationally, giving space for new, however ethically justified, insights (in Fig. ). Whole in AI implementation:
 Forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) like deep learning algorithms and neural networks are explored for novel healthcare applications in areas like imaging and diagnostics, treatment, risk analysis, health information management, virtual assistance, and patient monitoring . In addition to advanced mathematical models, the implementation of AI can be perceived as AI-based software that informs or influences clinical or administrative decisions and healthcare delivery . Big data, data integration, and combined information allow physicians in discovering more consistent patterns of diseases. In Europe researchers found five distinct types of diabetes instead of two by analyzing data of 14 755 patients. A refined classification is useful in individualized treatment and better identification of patients with increased risk.  Cardiac arrhythmia causes approximately 12% of all deaths globally. Medical Internet of Things (IoT) means many new opportunities to health care. IoTbased devices are more human-friendly because of smaller, compact size. IoT-based ECGs e.g., have brought new ways for the automated cardiac arrhythmia detection and follow-up. In this area a new deeplearning based innovation which consists of two modules: a data cleaning module and a heartbeat classification module assists in heartbeats identification and classification making these innovations even more reliable.  Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and a major health problem. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can reveal the early stage of this disease and electroencephalography (EEG) is a good choice in detecting of MCI biomarkers. A model which is based on modern machine learning technique (Extreme learning machine, ELM) has been used successfully to distinguish MCI from healthy control subjects with good classification accuracy (98,78%) and fast processing time.  Assessment of vascular characteristics plays an interesting role in many medical illnesses, like diabetes, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. Retinal vascular disorders refer to many eye diseases. Machine-based quantification of retinal vessels assists ophthalmologists in screening processes. In combined approach is used colour coded texture mapping that increased accuracy in image analysis of the retina and automates the analysis of retinal vessel widths.  AI algorithms have also a role in medical imaging e.g., for breast cancer in improving the performance of mammography and in diagnosing breast cancer at a higher rate than pathologists . Pollen allergy is a global concern. Neural networks model combined with data and local social media is utilized successfully in the classification of allergy symptoms.  In the field of dermatology AI has the potential to assist in the diagnostics and at the interface between primary and secondary care . AI applications serve in clinical practice also in pathology and by robotassisted surgery, in precision robotic treatment, and in virtual reality-enabled robotics . As well, AI has a potential role in biopharmaceutical development, in cloud -based digital drug discovery, and in deep genomics in clinical trials ."

As a result of rapid technological advancement over the past decade, there has been an explosion in virtual diabetes management program offerings rooted in smartphone technology, connected devices for blood glucose monitoring, and remote coaching or support. Such offerings take many forms with unique features. We provide a care team-based classification system for connected diabetes care programs and highlight their strengths and limitations. We also include a framework for how the different classes of connected diabetes care may be deployed in a health system to promote improved population health.","a chatbot over a human care team. For this model to be successful, users of AI coaches should still regularly see a physician for prescriptions and other therapeutic needs, and the physician should be abreast of the users' interactions with the AI coach. Virtual diabetes clinics:
 Examples: Welldoc, Lark Health Software tools for brick-and-mortar HCPs Software tools for brick-and-mortar HCPs provide clinicians who practice independently or in a clinic or hospital setting a means of remotely managing, risk-stratifying, and/or communicating with patients. Data included in the tool may be derived from a mobile app, connected device, physician notes, and/or lab values. The most useful features found in these tools are population risk stratification modules, two-way secure communication with patients and other members of the care team, and a consolidated hub for all disease-specific patient data for a clinician to inspect during and between clinic visits. Risk stratification dashboards highlight the patients that are in most need of outreach or a therapeutic adjustment based on metrics such as high A1c, low time-in-range, frequent hyper-or hypoglycemia, lack of selfmonitored glucose data, or high diabetes distress. As laid out by Crossen et al.  , clinicians can then reach out to subsets of patients by phone, text, video and/or invite for an in-person visit based on their individualized needs. Developers of these tools are beginning to bolster their products with more prescriptive decision support that recommends specific therapy adjustments rather than simply flagging patients for assessment and outreach. Such software could enable non-endocrinologists to manage diabetes therapies and devices with greater confidence and facility. Virtual diabetes clinics:
 Software tools can help brick-and-mortar clinicians more effectively manage populations of people with diabetes. They also provide a secure, low-hassle means of monitoring and communicating with patients between clinic visits. Software tools can also potentially help HCPs to expand their patient panel, though probably not to a significant enough extent that dedicated remote care teams are no longer needed. There are, however, three notable challenges with these software tools: (1) Health systems need to develop efficient workflows that ensure all clinicians practice at the top of their licenses and that physician and NP time is optimally leveraged to serve a large panel size; (2) Not all are currently embedded in the electronic health record (EHR), forcing clinicians to navigate multiple interfaces; and (3) Time spent using these tools is not currently reimbursed but can generate additional work for the provider team (in their current form). Payment reform toward a more capitated or outcomesbased system could allow health systems to reorganize staff, care delivery, and compensation to incentivize optimal utilization of these software tools. Virtual diabetes clinics:
 Examples: Glooko, Tidepool, Fitbit (Twine Health), device manufacturer software, diabetes-specific EHR modules Virtual diabetes clinics:
 The quantified self solution (QSS) QSS's are the least clinical and most patient-facing of the connected diabetes care solutions. In most QSS's, health plans or employers provide people with non-prescription connected devices-activity trackers, wireless blood pressure cuffs, wireless scales, etc.-but no coaching. They may include engagement tactics such as gamification, financial incentives, or other motivation."

Objective This study aimed to describes how adults with diabetes requiring insulin perceive diabetes apps based on 3 key psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and connectivity) described by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) on motivation. Methods This was a qualitative analysis of data collected during a crossover randomized laboratory trial (N=92) testing 2 diabetes apps. Data sources included (1) observations during app testing and (2) survey responses on desired app features. Guided by the SDT, coding categories included app functions that could address psychological needs for motivation in self-management: competence, autonomy, and connectivity. Results Patients described design features that addressed needs for competence, autonomy, and connectivity. To promote competence, electronic data recording and analysis should help patients track and understand blood glucose (BG) results necessary for planning behavior changes. To promote autonomy, BG trend analysis should empower patients to set safe and practical personalized behavioral goals based on time and the day of the week. To promote connectivity, app email or messaging function could share data reports and communicate with others on self-management advice. Additional themes that emerged are the top general app designs to promote positive user experience: patient-friendly; automatic features of data upload; voice recognition to eliminate typing data; alert or reminder on self-management activities; and app interactivity of a sound, message, or emoji change in response to keeping or not keeping BG in the target range. Conclusions The application of the SDT was useful in identifying motivational app designs that address the psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and connectivity. User-centered design concepts, such as being patient-friendly, differ from the SDT because patients need a positive user experience (ie, a technology need). Patients want engaging diabetes apps that go beyond data input and output. Apps should be easy to use, provide personalized analysis reports, be interactive to affirm positive behaviors, facilitate data sharing, and support patient-clinician communication.","such as being patient-friendly and requiring minimal user effort, are also important. Continued efforts are needed to understand long-term adoption of diabetes apps to support self-management by patients, as well as the integration of diabetes apps in the telehealth setting for clinicians.

In addition, they also have a very high incidence of metabolic diseases such as prehypertension, hypertension, visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, type-2 diabetes, and its clinical complications. Currently, there are over 75 million diabetic subjects in India and an equal number of prediabetics. Republic of China has taken over India as the diabetes capital of the world, with over 115 million diabetics. Modern medicine is disease focused and has failed to address the prevention of these chronic diseases. According to the reports from the United Nations (Millennium Development Goals [MDGs], the World Health Organization, Global Health Initiatives, and the non-communicable disease risk task force), obesity has increased by 2-fold and type-2 diabetes by 4-fold worldwide. Experts in this field predict that chances of meeting the MDGs set by the UN members of reducing the incidence of these diseases at 2025 to the level of 2020 are very little. Western medicine has failed to reduce or reverse the trend in the incidence of these diseases. We feel that an integrated approach to health care may be a better option, to reduce the disease burden in developing and resource-poor countries. Having said that, one cannot prevent something that one is not aware of, as such it is the need of the hour for us, to develop a robust predictive and preventive health-care platform. In an earlier article, we presented our views on reducing or reversing cardiometabolic diseases. There is great enthusiasm among the health-care providers and professional bodies that integration of emerging technologies will help develop personalized, precision medicine, as well as reduce the cost of health-care worldwide.","(FDA) of the USA approved Israel's DreaMed Diabetes App., an Advisor Pro, for managing diabetes treatment with CGMs for type-1 diabetics.

 How about the low end or run of the mill approaches to health care? Availability of inexpensive sensors and software analytical capabilities and smart platforms such as iPads and smartphones has created a flurry of activities to develop mobile health care and management applications. What started as wellness apps have now become part of National and International studies. One such application is the use of Fitbit activity tracker, by the prestigious National Institutes of Health, USA, to track sleeping patterns. Fitbit the leading global wearables brand has been selected for use in the National ""All of Us"" Research Program established by the White House in the US. This National level research program is aiming to get 1 million Americans, to eventually enroll in the program. The Scripps Translational Science Institute will be using Fitbit devices for looking into how individual characteristics can affect health and disease treatment. The program will collect genetic information from participants and use wearable devices to track health-related metrics including heart rate and sleep patterns. Recent developments in mobile health applications, global shift toward precision medicine, and health metrics that can be generated through wearables have the potential to provide cost-effective, highly personalized, sustainable health-care solutions. Smart vascular stents with sensors that can monitor blood flow have been developed and are under clinical evaluation for further validation and possible replacement of the conventional bare metal and drug-eluting stents. If these sensors are capable of measuring the fluid dynamics of the circulating blood, then they would be the first one of kind sensors, to monitor in real time, the thrombotic or hemorrhagic status of the circulating blood.

Modern tools are used in intelligent medicine to make it simple to explore patient data, connect people with services and entities, and manage and respond to changes in the medical setting. Individuals, medical experts, associations, and authorities are just a few of the entities in the medical sector that are connected through smart treatment. Cloud computing (CC), artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and sensors technology all of which are developing rapidly help to accomplish this. The evolution of the rapidly developing, ground-breaking idea termed smart treatment is significantly influenced by these innovations . Health systems are evolving and becoming more contemporary owing to the development of IoT and CC technologies and prominent companies are increasingly embracing cloud technology in professional medical care. The United States created a cooperative care system to make it simple for patients to obtain scattered medical data. The US Secretary of State is partnering with all Scripts and MicroHealth to develop a cloud-based healthcare system for the administration of its worldwide digital health data. The ministry of state's medical and administrative personnel will have simple availability to the individuals' hospital history owing to this technology. Both patients and healthcare providers will gain from this. The use of IoT gadgets in the medical sector is expanding. The IoT and CC innovations are being incorporated into healthcare solutions by medical professionals in Europe and Asia . The idea of a digital society is not novel given that more residents are relocating to urban areas. The foundation of a digital town is the transformation of the medical field via improved efficiency, decreased costs, and a renewed emphasis on patient welfare. A thorough grasp of the various digital city systems is necessary for the implementation of CC and AI for remote healthcare (RH) observation platforms. These platforms take the shape of supporting techniques, apparatus, platforms, concepts, layouts, application cases, and software products. The fundamental way that the CC-based RH platform uses AI is to collect various records and information. On the contrary hand, a variety of medical sector delivery models and medical outcome assistance tools contain AI techniques that are widely utilized to develop analytical depictions. Medical outcome support tools thoroughly consider each element before recommending a specific course of therapy, lifestyle recommendations, and care plan to individuals. The software employed supports healthcare activities and analyzes bodily functions such as blood sugar, respiratory rate, and pulse rate . All of the equipment used in the medical sector has been automated as a result of modern technology improvements. These technological innovations make life easier and more pleasant. People thus employ a variety of gadgets in their everyday lives, such as wearable sensors. A novel way to gather medical data for effective health monitoring is made possible by wearable sensors and virtual communities. But utilizing wearable sensors to continuously monitor patients produces a lot of medical data. These tools may be used to keep a close eye on the person in real-time. It helps to monitor the patients and detect the disease. Earlier disease detection is very essential to treat patients . Remote healthcare observation is a kind of telehealth that entails utilizing digital health technology to gather and transmit patient wellness information to their medical team. For preventive therapeutic practice and to include the patient's families in a children's treatment, RH may be used to collect and show longitudinal patient-generated medical information. For many years, gathering remote information has been regarded as the pattern of treatment for various severe illnesses. However, the widespread use of RH in medicine has been restricted by software restrictions, shortages in connectivity to the Web and"

Prior to that, Cawley, Boucherdat, Zuelzer, Gley, de Meyer, Schafer, Scott, Kleiner, and Paulescu all worked on this problem with varying results until Banting, Best, MacLeod, and Collip in Toronto in 1921 successfully treated pancreatectomized dogs with an alcohol-based pancreatic extract and then were the first to do the same with children and adults with diabetes, starting with Leonard Thompson in early 1922. Urinary and blood glucose levels were reduced, and clinical symptoms decreased concurrently. The magnificent medical historical work by Professor Michael Bliss, also from Toronto, as well as an excellent US NPR Television documentary, describes the trials and tribulations of this event that culminated in the “fastest Nobel Prize” awarded. Progressive biopharmaceutical advances have modified insulin from pigs and cows and then genetically engineered insulin to work much faster and also much slower to provide more modernized ways of providing insulin. Insulin pens then replaced vial and syringe administration, and then insulin pumps coupled with continuous blood glucose sensors have made delivery more physiologic in addition to more attention paid to nutrition advice, education, and psychosocial support around the world. Programs to assist delivery of expensive insulin to LRC administered by Insulin for Life, Life for a Child (LFAC), Changing Diabetes in Children (CDIC) coupled with support by ISPAD (International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes) have continued to make such advances available thorough wonderful philanthropy in insulin manufacturers and manufacturers of blood glucose monitoring equipment and insulin pump/sensor suppliers.","improvement occurs. This has been demonstrated in younger children (and their parents), school-agers, and adolescents as well as young and older adults, and even in type 2 diabetes patients, it is now being evaluated for such technological advanced usage. Blood Glucose Monitoring with AI, Artificial Pancreas Hybrid Closed Loops, and Closed Loops: Decision Support Systems for Insulin Adjustment:
 However, there remains a data paradox that having more information and more sophisticated methods of delivering insulin, as well as ways to counter-balance food and activity as well as stress effects on glucose levels per se, sometimes also correlates with worse health outcomes, and this is thought to reflect the increased financial and emotional burden of such systems. Time spent during health care visits also may become more facetime with computers than actual health care professional: patient/family time during visits as well as between visits, especially in the beginning phase of such treatment processesand even with ongoing support and encouragement. Health care professionals have to learn to use such tools in somewhat different ways compared to more traditional approaches and, of course, in areas where there are limited or only medium resources available, such tools remain impractical under such circumstances (see section below). Nevertheless, with more availability of cellular technologies, even in LRC or MRC areas of the world, electronic reminders and ways to communicate are being facilitated increasingly. Reminders to health care providers also can be incorporated into such systems. Focused patient reports and ways to highlight important aspects of such results can also facilitate improving care."

 In the rapidly evolving eld of healthcare, a diverse range of research possibilities are available. Introduction:
 e Internet of ings (IoT) is driving this transformation in the way things are done, and it will continue to do so (IoT). Patients with chronic illnesses are the primary benefactors of modern technology, which has gained in popularity in recent years due to its ability to treat them more e ectively. As a result, Internet of ings technology o ers diabetes patients new options. Chronic diseases, on the other hand, are long-lasting and necessitate long-term treatment. Introduction:
 e majority of patients with long-term medical illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease, are admitted to the hospital and remain there for signi cant periods of time. Chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are among the most common. Introduction:
 Diabetes is today a very severe problem since it is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing thousands of individuals each year. In order to operate normally on a daily basis, the diabetic patient must be properly treated on an ongoing basis. Introduction:
 Diabetes is considered as a long-term condition that tends to occur if it fails to produce insulin . Blood sugar levels (high or low) can have a negative impact on a variety of organs, including the eyes, neurons, and blood vessels, among others. Patients with diabetes must have their health regularly monitored in order to prevent their health from deteriorating. Introduction:
 e rise in the number of diabetic patients has necessitated an increase in the use of patient monitoring devices during the last few years. e purpose of diabetic patient monitoring systems is to continuously monitor blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. e glucose levels can be monitored at all times by patients, family members, and doctors, who can respond quickly if anything appears to be amiss. Introduction:
 e life of patients with diabetes is enhanced by reducing the length of their hospital stays, which can be accomplished through the use of diabetic portable monitoring devices. e use of wireless technology to communicate data between patients and healthcare providers that has a wide range of coverage could be particularly beneficial in these instances, according to the researchers. High-speed transmission as well as network capacity and scalability in the next general cellular network technology are the most important features of 5G technology. Data transfer speeds are currently being evaluated using this technology  to see if it has the potential to speed up data transport. e use of deterministic mathematical models in the treatment of diabetic patients can be beneficial. ere has been little attention paid to mathematical models of diabetes mellitus in the scientific literature to date. When it comes to determining the pandemic potential of diabetes mellitus, a technique known as stochastic numerical analysis (SNA) is still relevant . Introduction:
 In our technique, data collected by a simple sensor with low cost and power was employed for categorization purposes. e patient information was updated on a daily basis in the cloud. It is possible that doctors will use this information to detect and treat diabetes in patients whose blood glucose levels fluctuate outside of the usual range."

National health planning and resource allocation will face serious challenges. To explore prevention and treatment measures to reduce the incidence of diabetes, decreasing the incidence of complications and medical costs has become the focus of global health and medical management. Introduction:
 For patients with DM, many interventions can improve their health outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have, including glycaemic control combined with diet, physical activity, and medication. However, most studies have focused on pharmacoeconomic evaluations of drug treatment. Although the costs and effects of different medication regimens to screen cost-effective medication regimens have been measured, there are few reports on the health economics evaluation of intervention management models, and the evaluation of medical consequences in research involves mostly clinical biochemical indicators. erefore, it is necessary to conduct health economic evaluations of diabetes interventions.

 Singapore's healthcare system is in the process of transformation. From country-wide vaccination programmes started during Singapore's independence focusing on infectious diseases , to the establishment of polyclinics, general hospitals, and specialist centers to address chronic disease management, to the current COVID-19 pandemic , healthcare challenges are constantly evolving. Although Singapore has excellent healthcare outcomes with an average life expectancy increased over the years , we face the combined challenge of rising healthcare costs, aging population with an increasing burden of chronic diseases and shortage of healthcare professionals. Diabetes alone is projected to affect more than 1 million people by 2050, more than double compared to 2014 . INTRODUCTION:
 To overcome these challenges, Singapore needs to transform the way it delivers care. The Ministry of Health Singapore (MOH) has framed the healthcare transformation using the ""3 Beyonds"" strategy-""Beyond Healthcare to Health, Beyond Hospital to Community, Beyond Quality to Value"" . ""Beyond Healthcare to Health"" involves strategies to promote the early detection of chronic diseases and prevent diseases with healthy lifestyles. ""Beyond Hospital to Community"" drives a shift in care from the hospital to primary care and then to the home, enabling aging in place at home. ""Beyond Quality to Value"" strives for improved efficiency to achieve better outcomes while lowering costs and reducing waste. The explosive increase in the amounts of healthcare data, along with the improved performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised as a transformational force in healthcare. INTRODUCTION:
 First of all, AI tools have demonstrated the capability to enable the creation and delivery of better management services to deal with chronic diseases. Many research groups have investigated the application of AI to control blood glucose for diabetes mellitus (DM) . Many of them have been tested using virtual patients or simulations. For example, Mauseth et al. ( ) designed an AI-based controller, namely fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to personalize glycemic control by determining the dosing of insulin on artificial pancreas. Daskalaki et al.  presented an adaptive, patient-specific blood glucose control strategy based on the another AI approach called reinforcement learning, and tested their approach on 28 virtual type-1 DM patients. Their results suggested that the AI approach could improve nocturnal blood glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. INTRODUCTION:
 Secondly, AI could also be used as a digital health coaching tool that help patients to manage their conditions at home. AI has empowered chatbots to provide virtual assistance to patients and answer simple questions about their condition. For example, Stein et al.  developed a pure AI-driven fully automated conversational health coaching mobile application for obese adults. INTRODUCTION:
 Their results showed that the AI application could help the participants to achieve weight loss comparable to in-person lifestyle interventions. Other researchers have developed ""AI doctors"" that provide health advice directly to patients with common symptoms, freeing up primary care access for more complex care . A survey conducted on 800 European and American patients with atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes or breast cancer found that while many patients did not want their doctors replaced by AI, most of them were happy with a round-the-clock virtual assistance from an AI agent ."

The co-design approach, which unleashes the end-user power, can contribute actively in improving the healthcare systems. It deals with understanding the user behaviors, requirements, and motivations through observation, inspection, task analysis, and feedback techniques. Consequently, both the co-design and digital technologies might empower the management of patients’ health and that of their families. The research strategy is based on a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to summarize how the co-design methodologies handled the existing technology-based health systems for their improvement. Based on the findings, we establish the following hypotheses: (i) A user-centered methodology for service implementation might offer a promising tool to enhance the healthcare services quality before they be launched; (ii) Several limitations can affect the co-design approach in digital health, such as a bias for a patients’ group. Efforts have been made to reduce this risk by identifying bias at an early stage, or different groups should be included in the test phase for example; (iii) Use decision-making devices that handle technologies for patient and clinical healthcare solution ","al. , efforts to reduce this risk should therefore be made by identifying potential bias in advance, providing standardized procedures, using external sources for task recognition, and involving other researchers in task creation and validation, results coding and interpretation, as well as guideline reviews. Discussion and research findings:
 When multiple participants are involved in the testing process; Consequently, many tests will be done, this can increase the likelihood of discovering innovations. In other words, it should evaluate the proposed system for different scenarios to be sure that is an effective one. By using decision support apps, disease management can be done outside the hospital easily, and it also empowers patients to optimize their conditions. Nonetheless, the key to the success of them lies in how complex and user-friendly they are for patients. Recently, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a draft covering some critical and significant recommendations concerning the use of patient and clinical decision-making devices , such as: Discussion and research findings:
 • Developing approachable and non-harmful designs of devices used; • Selecting the most suitable themes and colors of devices; • Developing modest and attractive designs of devices; • Complying with UI principles which includes, using well recognizable icons, readable and inclusive large fonts, high-quality images while designing the healthcare devices. Discussion and research findings:
 4. For IoT-based healthcare solutions, there are several enabling technologies: Discussion and research findings:
 • Grid or Cloud Computing may provide ubiquitous access to common resources for performing operations to meet different needs; • Big Data can help increase health analysis efficiency and monitoring instruments and systems; this is made possible by dealing with a large amount of medical sensors' data; • Big Data can include huge amounts of essential health data generated from diverse medical sensors and provide tools for increasing the efficiency of relevant health diagnosis and monitoring methods and stages; • Doing simple, intuitive, and attractive designs; Discussion and research findings:
 • Networks for short-scale communications (e.g., WPANs, WBANs, WLANs, 6LoWPANs, and WSNs) and large-scale communications (e.g., any kind of cellular network) might be part of the infrastructure of the IoT-based healthcare network; • Wearables can achieve patient engagement and consequently, population health improvements can be facilitated; • The DL and ML should be the future health technology investments and the healthcare responsibles must deploy to have AI help with clinical decision making and to predict patient outcomes; • AI-based algorithms can be developed and used in personal healthcare monitoring. Additionally, in order to better predict disease outbreaks in advance based on logged healthcare data. Discussion and research findings:
 5. The large-scale adoption of such technologies also presents an enormous and unimagined potential for novel, unforeseen threats. Therefore, all stakeholders -governments, policymakers, and industry -must work with academia to ensure that new technologies are developed with these potential threats in mind and that the security, traceability, transparency, explainability, validity, and verifiability of AI applications in our everyday lives are ensured. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure the use of trustworthy and ethically reliable AI and to avoid the misuse of AI technologies ."

With such a large disease burden, even a small error in classification can be significant. Currently billing codes, assigned at the time of a medical encounter, are the “gold standard” reflecting the actual diseases present in an individual, and thus in aggregate reflect disease prevalence in the population. These codes are generated by highly trained coders and by health care providers but are not always accurate.
Objective: This work provides a scalable deep learning methodology to more accurately classify individuals with diabetes across multiple health care systems.
Methods: We leveraged a long short-term memory-dense neural network (LSTM-DNN) model to identify patients with or without diabetes using data from 5 acute care facilities with 187,187 patients and 275,407 encounters, incorporating data elements including laboratory test results, diagnostic/procedure codes, medications, demographic data, and admission information. Furthermore, a blinded physician panel reviewed discordant cases, providing an estimate of the total impact on the population.
Results: When predicting the documented diagnosis of diabetes, our model achieved an 84% F1 score, 96% area under the curve–receiver operating characteristic curve, and 91% average precision on a heterogeneous data set from 5 distinct health facilities. However, in 81% of cases where the model disagreed with the documented phenotype, a blinded physician panel agreed with the model. Taken together, this suggests that 4.3% of our studied population have either missing or improper diabetes diagnosis.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that deep learning methods can improve clinical phenotyping even when patient data are noisy, sparse, and heterogeneous.","discordant records for human review, leading to more accurate patient and population characterization. This strategy can be used to guide coders at the time of discharge to re-evaluate charts detected by the algorithm, with more directed attention to the potential missed diagnosis. Principal Findings:
 To validate the simulation of operational deployment of such a model, we used a double-blinded physician review panel to review the discordant cases where the model prediction was in contrary to the documented diagnosis. From this review, we not only captured the panel's diagnosis but also the confidence level of their decision. During the review, the experts felt that some cases were too complex or needed more data for a model to classify correctly. Despite this, our panel and algorithm agreed on the final diagnosis among 81.25% of cases when the algorithm was confident in its prediction. In a real health system, this would equate to an anticipated 4 corrections to the coding for every 5 cases flagged by the model for further review. This is estimated to impact about 2.4% of a facility's entire population missing a diabetes code that should be present, and about 1.9% of the population who were given the code of diabetes when it should not have been present. This suggests that our methodology is highly promising for improving clinical decision support to flag possibly missing or improper ICD classifications. Limitations:
 This work could benefit from expert validation at larger scale, which would result in a more accurate estimation of the effect on the population. As patients' background information was very limited in this study, we did not expect significant difference using other methods such as attention-based models; however, they can be beneficial where more background data are available. Moreover, we are collaborating with the diabetes care group of our network hospitals to incorporate our prediction model into a pilot study. Conclusions:
 As research continues to advance the capabilities of predictive algorithms to medicine, we demonstrate a successful application of deep learning methodology bridging the gap at the intersection of computer science and clinical medicine. Conclusions:
 We can classify a disease state in patients using a generalizable model that is deployable in institutions adopting the OHDSI standard. Our sequential deep learning-based model outperformed both traditional machine learning and nonsequential DNN as shown earlier. Results proved that the deep learning model can capture patterns for phenotyping from a high-dimension feature space without hand-crafted feature engineering. The findings also provide insights into how to build a framework/workflow using real-world EHR data for enhancing operations in real-world health care organizations, especially in applications to clinical intervention, documentation and billing, as well as quality improvement. The success of such disease prediction models can also benefit academic and translational research, as a faster and more refined disease phenotyping process allows researchers to better refine their study cohorts and minimize bias or confounding variables. Most importantly, one cannot understate the potential impact to patient care and clinical outcomes afforded by this approach to diagnostic validation and case ascertainment."

 Hassan, El Desouky  has developed an intelligent and context-aware hybrid model for assisting patients at home under close supervision. Cloud-based systems monitor chronic illness patients at home and store and process massive amounts of data generated by ambient assisted living systems. The local component monitors patients in the event of a cloud system failure or internet disconnect. Real-time health status can be determined using context-aware methods that continuously monitor ambient conditions, physiological signals, and patient behavior. The effectiveness of the model for monitoring and identifying emergencies in an unbalanced dataset has been demonstrated in an experimental case study, including patients with blood pressure disorders. However, the case study only included a small sample size of patients. In order to truly be effective, the local component would need to be tested on a larger, more diverse group of patients. Kumar, Lokesh  propose a mobile healthcare IoT and cloud-based application. By combining the medical sensors with the UCI repository dataset, the researchers have created diabetes datasets for predicting people with severe diabetes. Additionally, a new algorithm has been developed that diagnoses and estimates the severity of diseases using fuzzy rule-based neural classifiers. Health records from various hospitals and UCI Repository datasets were used for some experiments. Compared to existing disease prediction systems, the proposed mechanism is more effective. However, there are some potential drawbacks to this system. First, it is reliant on accurate and up-to-date data from both the medical sensors and the UCI repository. If either of these sources is inaccurate or out-of-date, the predictions made by the system will be less accurate. Additionally, the system is only as effective as the algorithms used to make the predictions. If the algorithms are not accurate, the predictions will also be inaccurate. II. RELATED WORKS:
 Using edge-cognitive computing, Chen, Li  have developed an intelligent healthcare system. This system monitors and assesses users' physical health using cognitive computing. Using a health risk assessment table, a user's health risk grade is determined under various health statuses and then distributed across the entire edge computing network based on the user's health risk grade. As a result, the network has a deeper cognitive intelligence that is application-aware. Experiments show the proposed method increases patient survival rates in an emergency while improving user experience and maximizing computing resource utilization. However, there are also potential risks associated with this health risk assessment table. For example, if the health risk grade is incorrectly determined, it could lead to devastating consequences for the user. In addition, if the table is not updated frequently, it may not be accurate in predicting health risks."

 The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that there are currently 451 million diabetic patients worldwide and this number is expected to exceed 693 million by 2045 [3]. In the Sultanate of Oman, as reported by the Ministry of Health, a total of 94,921 cases of diabetes were registered at a national level in 2017, including 6360 new cases in the various governorates of Oman, of which 51.8 percent were women with 3198 cases compared to 2863 men and the numbers are increasing at a significant rate annually . The World Health Organization also predicted that the number of diabetics in Oman would increase by about 217,000 by 2025 . Diabetes is an illness in which the body produces insufficient insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates normal blood glucose levels. Treatment of diabetic disease requires regular visits to health care, which is not feasible in the present pandemic situation of COVID-19. Thus, telemedicine is the only option for any medical procedure requiring remote care. Furthermore, this situation is exacerbated by the COVID-19 scenario due to a shortage of medical personnel and healthcare facilities, as the majority of resources are diverted to COVID-19 patients. Therefore, an expert system for diabetes management is much more needed than before. Although RPM-related efforts have been ongoing for a long time, they are now receiving significantly greater attention than in the past. Various smartphone sensor research and reviews for health monitoring and diagnosis along with the cyber threats, use of cloud computing in IoT devices  are also being conducted . The study in  details an internet of things (IoT)-based health care system including a heart pulse sensor, a body temperature sensor, and a galvanic skin reaction sensor, and demonstrates that the IoT linked with health wearables can eliminate the need to visit hospitals for primary health concerns. In , MATLAB is used to simulate a remote healthcare monitoring system that employs an expert system to monitor the health state of a patient via multiple wearable sensors. In this section, we are going to discuss the various efforts that have been recorded related to diabetes management and their benefits, shortcomings, and drawbacks."

The countries have utilized different strategies in the last few years to combat Covid-19 based on their capabilities, technological infrastructure, and investments. A massive epidemic like this cannot be controlled without an intelligent and automatic health care system. The first reaction to the disease outbreak was lockdown, and researchers focused more on developing methods to diagnose the disease and recognize its behavior. However, as the new lifestyle becomes more normalized, research has shifted to utilizing computer-aided methods to monitor, track, detect, and treat individuals and provide services to citizens. Thus, the Internet of things, based on fog-cloud computing, using artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning, and deep learning are practical concepts. This article aims to survey computer-based approaches to combat Covid-19 based on prevention, detection, and service provision. Technically and statistically, this article analyzes current methods, categorizes them, presents a technical taxonomy, and explores future and open issues. ","cloud servers can present cost, infrastructure, privacy, and security challenges. The selection of composing services is challenging but can be improved when the QoS factors are considered . Here, we review healthcare technologies, their challenges, and solutions presented by other researchers. Services provision:
 Hayyolalam et al.  proposed a framework for composing healthcare services that combine IoT, AI, cloud technologies, and edge intelligence. In this study, the Edge Device as a Service (EDaaS) concept allows healthcare applications and services to be more intelligent by incorporating AI algorithms into resource-limited edge devices. They design a framework for composing AI subtasks that can be considered reliable in terms of QoS and quality of experience (QoE). By employing the proposed framework, when a user submits a single or combined request to a healthcare application, rather than a single device completing the entire task, it is divided into multiple subtasks assigned to different edge devices. All subtasks are compiled and distributed to the user without being aware that they are divided. Because of the many devices and solutions, distributing IoT data and AI subtasks becomes NP-Hard. Therefore, the authors applied three meta-heuristic algorithms (PSO: particle swarm optimization, BWO: black widow optimization, simulated annealing) to identify uncertain and near-optimal edge devices. They assessed the framework's efficiency utilizing these three algorithms using MATLAB simulation in healthcare applications and discovered that BWO was more efficient than PSO or simulated annealing. The framework's scalability, fitness, availability, reliability, and QoS were evaluated. This study assumed that all edge devices and users were part of the same network, and the network size was determined solely by the number of devices connected to it. There is the possibility that future researchers may move edge devices to a different network to compose services. In addition, the impact of the proposed method on the performance of AI algorithms may be explored in the future. Services provision:
 Asghari et al.  proposed a framework based on IoT data (IoTD) and cloud technologies. Patients' physical symptoms are collected through the body and environmental sensors and incorporated into their medical history in cloud repositories. The patient's whole health data would be analyzed to provide a composite health/medical prescription, and the results reported by medical teams would be shared with the patients. Following the appropriate treatment instructions for the patient's condition, they can select their preferred services. Although the same services are available at different centers, the locations, times, and costs may differ. In this manner, patients or their relatives can choose the services and features they desire, and the system will determine the most appropriate combination for them. The authors applied data collected from diabetic patients in medical centers to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed framework; they also developed simulating techniques to evaluate IoT data. The final step of their study was to test several classification algorithms to diagnose the disease and determine accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. In comparing several classification algorithms, K-Star is more effective than others. The accuracy metric could be compared in future research to the usual methods used by physicians. Additionally, they suggested integrating data mining methods and metaheuristic approaches with the proposed framework and subsequently implementing them in practice."

 Edge and Fog nodes increase the capability of user experience in the healthcare sector. These networked nodes provide text, video, or image analytics with the help of robust AI mechanisms and sensor devices. For instance, monitoring patients in ambulances using edge devices or mobile devices assist technicians to deliver first-aid services with the advice of remotely available doctors before the patient was reached in hospitals; virtual reality enabled operating rooms are becoming a new normal for practicing edge supported operations to patients. Edge/fog layers:
 Edge and fog nodes reduce latency when compared to cloud-level analytics. This real-time delivery of findings is one of the major characteristics of healthcare applications. Cloud services:
 A large volume of scalable computations and analytics of healthcare data is possible in cloud infrastructures. In fact, the recent newer cloud computing execution model such as serverless clouds has manifested the feasibility of providing reduced cost to the users. Typically, in healthcare applications, periodic monitoring of health-check devices is practiced. The frequency of remote monitoring is lower in some applications where the patients involved in the processes are quite normal. If a serverless execution model is not provided for such applications, the user could lead to huge costs due to the utilization of cloud server instances. Cloud services:
 In addition, the sensor data could be of higher size ranging from terabytes to zettabytes in healthcare applications, especially when video analytics of operations were involved. Obviously, there is a dire need for an automated scalable environment for healthcare applications. Cloud services:
 It could be noticed that to improve the prediction accuracy in remote health monitoring applications cloud services requires long-term analytics obtained from a larger dataset. For instance, bots increase accuracy by improving text analysis strategies; analytics of images is required for classifying, learning, or predicting health-related symptoms such as tumor analysis, cancer analysis , eyeretinal failure detections, and so forth; analytics of videos is required for learning the emotions of patients, neurological disorders, and sleep disorders. Hospitals and doctors:
 Remote healthcare monitoring architectures enable an active involvement of doctors or hospitals. For instance, mobile phones engage doctors and individuals; and, associated servers involve hospital authorities for decisionmaking processes. These mobile devices and gadgets connect doctors/hospitals in a remote fashion to strengthen the assurance of patients. Hospitals and doctors:
 Observing the most existing remote monitoring applications, doctors and hospitals are connected for providing online prescriptions/diagnostics , scheduling doc- tor appointments, sharing files/videos, communicating effectively, and so forth."

III. Impact of COVID-19 on Diabetics Patients:
 A meta-analysis was conducted in  to calculate the odds ratio of morbidity and mortality while comparing the diabetic patients who were in mechanical ventilation versus the diabetes patients who did not, and it was concluded that diabetes in patients with COVID-19 increased the mortality two-fold when compared to non-diabetics. Diabetic patients with COVID-19 have a higher probability of developing the hypercoagulable state due to increased fibrinogen and d dimer amounts. The standard dose of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is also not of much help to these patients since the dosage is insufficient to prevent the development of venous thrombosis . Thus high dosage anticoagulants are preferred for patients with comorbidities like diabetes. Hence it is evident that diabetic patients should take extra precautions, reasonable glycemic control, physical exercise, and social distancing in this pandemic . a. Secured Blockchain-based Edge Computing Framework for COVID Pandemic:
 Blockchain can be integrated with edge computing (BEC) for architecting a secured and low-latency response framework for processing the COVID related medical data. The framework is depicted in Fig. . The diversified big data on COVID collected from different data sources are in an unstructured format. But to make a meaningful interpretation, it must be converted into meaning data. Therefore the data accumulated are stored in Blockchain for retrieving the meaningful data safely. Since Blockchain is distributed, immutable, safer and transparent, it provides the data in a meaningful format. Blockchain-based big data processing framework will mine the diversified data and produce structured data that can be predictable. Data processing from the cloud for the ever single request may cause unprecedented delays, so to avoid this, the edge node can be used. The edge nodes with faster processing capability can reduce the processing time involved in retrieving data from the cloud server because the edge computing brings the computation closer to the network edge. Successively, AI algorithms can be used for making realtime predictive analysis on safety health measures, medical risk prediction, drug discovery, forecasting virus spread and faster diagnosis. Edge computing will ensure low latency response by faster data processing. Furthermore, edge computing with AI adds more intelligence to the edge nodes, making it a cognitive edge. This framework will be more secure and faster for COVID-19 data processing. IV. COVID-19 in Accelerating the AI Health Care Revolution:
 This pandemic disclosed how vulnerable our health care systems are with overburdened staff, untimely services, adequate medical supplies like personal protective equipment (PPE) and not enough hospital beds and cures. COVID-19 revealed that our hospitals are equipped only to handle linear demand, whereas the virus is growing at an exponential rate. We failed to estimate the importance of AI in these areas before the pandemic hit the world."

 The timely availability of healthcare services is a fundamental requirement for every individual. A country's healthcare system is a crucial measure of its developmental progress . In this aspect, eHealth is highly beneficial asit offers healthcare to everyone, wherever. Introduction:
 EHealth exemplifies technological advancements in expanding healthcare locally, nationally, and globally via the use of cutting-edge technologies (CET). Introduction:
 It enables individuals who are unable to visit the clinic to access health services through continuous monitoring of vital signs using wearable or implantable IoT (Internet-of-Things) sensors, particularly for chronic and elderly patients. Introduction:
 Time savings, insight into one's health, and reduced administrative burden are among the primary advantages provided by eHealth . According to a report presented by Statista in August 2022 (as shown in Fig. ), the use of eHealth in various healthcare sectors is also expanding ] (https:// www. stati sta. Introduction:
 com/ outlo ok/ dmo/ digit al-health/ eheal th/ world wide# reven ue). However, eHealth services have not developed as much as anticipated, partly due to issues of dependability, fault tolerance, and privacy. Introduction:
 In eHealth, biological data collected by IoT devices is transmitted to Cloud entities operated by third parties, which presents challenges for data security and the protection of a patient's privacy . Introduction:
 In eHealth, the wireless body area network (WBAN) is employed extensively. It is concerned with networks made up of several sensors that are dispersed across or implanted into the human body. These sensors take measurements of the body's important health signals and transmit them to the user's smart device. Introduction:
 Using the WBAN to check on a patient's health from afar is one way to help the patient live a normal life and do everyday things without having to live in a hospital or go there often . Introduction:
 But in a typical IoT design, a single health app running on a smartphone sends data to edge devices and then to cloud servers that are overseen by outside parties that are susceptible to various insider attacks . Introduction:
 Furthermore, as explained in , owing to third-party participation, traditional Edge or Cloud processes cannot provide accountability and traceability of patient data. Introduction:
 With the use of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), a smartphone's functionality may be expanded by sending medical records to a remote server for processing and storage . The success of MCC depends on how well network loss and latency can be controlled. Introduction:
 Lacking this, the enormous storage and processing capacity of the cloud is rendered useless by transmission delays and unreliable connections. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers an IT service closer to the client to leverage the potential of Cloud computing capabilities. . Content processing in MEC is performed over edge devices. Introduction:
 This formed a bridge between IoT devices and the cloud for collection and processing of data. Bringing data collection and processing closer to the client/edges reduces latency and boosts the performance of high-bandwidth applications . Introduction:
 Since several parties are responsible for managing edge devices, moving work to remote servers on the network's periphery raises the risk of data theft and privacy violations ."
