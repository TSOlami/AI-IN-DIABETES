While coronary angiography (CAG) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) are standard diagnostic tools, they have inherent limitations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of multimodal echocardiography in assessing LAD stenosis severity in patients with T2DM."

A biodegradable porous zinc (Zn) scaffold incorporating sustained-release Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1), referred to as Zn-NGR1, was developed using powder metallurgy and impregnation techniques. Comprehensive characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the scaffold's morphology, composition, and controlled NGR1 release. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic and ovariectomized (OVX) rat model with femoral fractures, Zn-NGR1 implantation markedly accelerated fracture healing, enhanced angiogenesis as demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (IHC/IF) analysis for cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and improved mechanical strength in three-point bending tests. Bone volume fraction (BV/TV) increased by 20 % compared with controls. Transcriptomic profiling (RNA sequencing, RNA-seq) combined with network pharmacology and machine learning analysis identified the stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) signaling axis as the principal pathway activated by NGR1. In vitro, Zn-NGR1 significantly enhanced bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration, promoted osteogenic differentiation, and stimulated angiogenesis through SDF-1/CXCR4 upregulation, confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis. In vivo validation demonstrated that Zn-NGR1 facilitates diabetic fracture healing by activating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, thereby promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis. These findings indicate that Zn-NGR1 scaffolds represent a promising biomaterial strategy for improving DOF repair through targeted modulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis."

As the global population ages, these technologies promise not only greater efficiency but also new avenues for delivering scalable, accessible mental health support. However, as AI increasingly engages with domains once considered uniquely human-emotional intelligence, decision-making, and interpersonal connection-it raises deeper questions about the boundary between AI-simulated interaction and authentic human connection. This review examines the intersection of computational precision and existential complexity, emphasizing how theoretical frameworks such as the Theory of Computing (TOC) and Theory of Mind (ToM) can guide ethical and human-centered integration. While AI systems may convincingly simulate empathy or companionship, they cannot share subjective experience, vulnerability, or existential depth. By contrasting computational precision with the irreducible aspects of human complexity, we advocate for a transdisciplinary approach that embraces both the transformative potential of technology and the irreplaceable richness of human connection-especially in the later stages of life, when questions of purpose, mortality, and selfhood become most profound."

Ameer","10.1016/bs.acc.2025.10.012","","Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are external agents that interfere with normal hormone production, release, movement, attachment, activity, and removal. EDCs operate through various mechanisms, including receptor binding, interference with hormone production pathways, modification of hormone-transporting proteins, or disturbance of hormonal metabolic processes. Evidence links EDCs to several health conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Fortunately, the field of biomarker discovery for metabolic and endocrine disorders is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by advancements in metabolomics, multi-omics integration, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced diagnostics. Cutting-edge analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of novel biomarkers for early disease detection, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Metabolomics has played a crucial role in unraveling disease mechanisms, identifying biochemical signatures of metabolic dysfunctions, and bridging traditional and modern medical approaches. However, challenges remain in clinical validation, reproducibility, and specificity of these biomarkers. The incorporation of multi-omics technologies such as genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomic has provided a more comprehensive view of metabolic dysregulation. Future advancements in machine learning, AI-driven data analytics, and single-cell omics are expected to revolutionize precision medicine by enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes. As biomarker research continues to evolve, the convergence of high-throughput technologies, computational approaches, and clinical validation efforts will be critical in ensuring their translation into routine medical practice."

Early detection and prevention of DR is crucial to reduce the burden of this disease. The purpose of this study was to build a prediction model for DR using pupillary abnormalities as biomarkers. Pupillary parameters including Dark-adapted Baseline Pupillary Diameter (BPD), Amplitude of Pupillary Constriction (APC), Velocity of Pupillary Constriction (VPC), Amplitude of Pupil Re-dilatation after Maximum Constriction, and Velocity of Pupillary Dilatation (VPD) were collected and analyzed using machine learning algorithm including Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regressions, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier. Utilizing ROC analysis and the Youden index, this study identified cut-off values for pupillary abnormalities to detect DR risk. The study found that ANN performed well with an accuracy of 0.807 (95% CI: 0.65-0.94) and AUC of 0.879 (95% CI: 0.71-0.98) in predicting DR using pupillary abnormalities as biomarkers. The findings of this research offer significant insights into the predictive value of pupillary abnormalities for DR, establishing a strong foundation for early intervention strategies. Particularly, the superior performance of ANN in detecting DR presents an opportunity to refine risk stratification and prevention approaches, potentially transforming the prognosis for individuals at elevated risk of this condition."

This study aimed to explore MYO1C as both a candidate biomarker and elucidate its role as a mechanistic mediator of podocyte injury in T2DN. Using urinary extracellular vesicle RNA biomarkers identified from a training and validation cohort of 33 type 2 diabetes and 40 T2DN patients, we developed a machine learning diagnostic model for T2DN. The model achieved an AUC of 0.877 in validation and performed well in an independent test cohort with an AUC of 0.824. MYO1C was identified as the most influential feature in the final model. Mechanistic investigations in vitro and in vivo revealed that high glucose and high-fat conditions induced podocyte injury, inflammation, and apoptosis, with increased MYO1C expression. MYO1C knockdown in vitro and in vivo reduced podocyte damage and inflammatory responses. MYO1C overexpression enhanced p38, p-CREB, and TNF-α levels, while p38 inhibition mitigated these effects. These findings support MYO1C not only as a potential urinary biomarker for T2DN but also as a key pathogenic driver that promotes podocyte injury via p38 MAPK signaling, thereby highlighting its therapeutic promise."
