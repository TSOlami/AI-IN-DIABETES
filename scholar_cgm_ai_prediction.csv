These sensors provide in real-time, every 1–5 min, the current blood glucose concentration and its rate-of-change, two key pieces of information for improving the determination of exogenous insulin administration and the prediction of forthcoming adverse events, such as hypo-/hyper-glycemia. The current research in diabetes technology is putting considerable effort into developing decision support systems for patient use, which automatically analyze the patient’s data collected by CGM sensors and other portable devices, as well as providing personalized recommendations about therapy adjustments to patients. Due to the large amount of data collected by patients with T1D and their variety, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being adopted in these decision support systems. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methodologies using AI and CGM sensors for decision support in advanced T1D management, including techniques for personalized insulin bolus calculation, adaptive tuning of bolus calculator parameters and glucose prediction."

Here we show that prediabetes is characterized by metabolic heterogeneity, and that metabolic subphenotypes can be predicted by the shape of the glucose curve measured via a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) during standardized oral glucose-tolerance tests (OGTTs) performed in at-home settings. Gold-standard metabolic tests in 32 individuals with early glucose dysregulation revealed dominant or co-dominant subphenotypes (muscle or hepatic insulin-resistance phenotypes in 34% of the individuals, and β-cell-dysfunction or impaired-incretin-action phenotypes in 40% of them). Machine-learning models trained with glucose time series from OGTTs from the 32 individuals predicted the subphenotypes with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 95% for muscle insulin resistance, 89% for β-cell deficiency and 88% for impaired incretin action. With CGM-generated glucose curves obtained during at-home OGTTs, the models predicted the muscle-insulin-resistance and β-cell-deficiency subphenotypes of 29 individuals with AUCs of 88% and 84%, respectively. At-home identification of metabolic subphenotypes via a CGM may aid the risk stratification of individuals with early glucose dysregulation. "

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.

The ability to predict future glucose values can further optimize such devices. In this study, we used machine learning to train models in predicting future glucose levels based on prior CGM and accelerometry data. Methods We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observational population‐based cohort that comprises individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We included individuals who underwent >48h of CGM (n = 851), most of whom (n = 540) simultaneously wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity. A random subset of individuals was used to train models in predicting glucose levels at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on either CGM data or both CGM and accelerometer data. In the remaining individuals, model performance was evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE), Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rho) and surveillance error grid. For a proof-of-concept translation, CGM-based prediction models were optimized and validated with the use of data from individuals with type 1 diabetes (OhioT1DM Dataset, n = 6). Results Models trained with CGM data were able to accurately predict glucose values at 15 (RMSE: 0.19mmol/L; rho: 0.96) and 60 minutes (RMSE: 0.59mmol/L, rho: 0.72). Model performance was comparable in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Incorporation of accelerometer data only slightly improved prediction. The error grid results indicated that model predictions were clinically safe (15 min: >99%, 60 min >98%). Our prediction models translated well to individuals with type 1 diabetes, which is reflected by high accuracy (RMSEs for 15 and 60 minutes of 0.43 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively) and clinical safety (15 min: >99%, 60 min: >91%). Conclusions Machine learning-based models are able to accurately and safely predict glucose values at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on CGM data only. Future research should further optimize the models for implementation in closed-loop insulin delivery systems."

Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices bear the promise of providing the patients with an increased and timely awareness of glycemic conditions as these get dangerously near to hypo/hyperglycemia. The challenge is to detect, with reasonable advance, the patterns leading to risky situations, allowing the patient to make therapeutic decisions on the basis of future (predicted) glucose concentration levels. We underline that a technically sound performance comparison of the approaches proposed in recent years has yet to be done, thus it is unclear which one is preferred. The aim of this study is to fill this gap by carrying out a comparative analysis among the most common methods for glucose event prediction. Both regression and classification algorithms have been implemented and analyzed, including static and dynamic training approaches. The dataset consists of 89 CGM time series measured in diabetic subjects for 7 subsequent days. Performance metrics, specifically defined to assess and compare the event-prediction capabilities of the methods, have been introduced and analyzed. Our numerical results show that a static training approach exhibits better performance, in particular when regression methods are considered. However, classifiers show some improvement when trained for a specific event category, such as hyperglycemia, achieving performance comparable to the regressors, with the advantage of predicting the events sooner."

The recent increase in wearable devices for diabetes care, and in particular the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), generates large datasets and associated cybersecurity challenges. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify CGM data at an individual level by using standard machine learning techniques.


METHODS
The publicly available REPLACE-BG dataset containing 226 adult participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) wearing CGM over 6 months was used. A support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier aiming to determine if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual participant was trained and tested for each of the subjects in the dataset. To generate the feature vector used for classification, 12 standard glycaemic metrics were selected and evaluated at different time periods of the day (24h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, dinner). Different window lengths of CGM data (3, 7, 15, and 30 days) were chosen to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. A recursive feature selection method was employed to select the minimum subset of features that did not significantly degrade performance.


RESULTS
A total of 40 features were generated as a result of evaluating the glycemic metrics over the selected time periods (24h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, dinner). A window length of 15 days was found to perform the best in terms of accuracy (86.8±12.8%) and F1 score (0.86±0.16). The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 85.7±19.5% and 87.9±17.5%, respectively. Through recursive feature selection, a subset of 11 features was shown to perform similarly to the 40 features.


CONCLUSION
It is possible to determine with a relatively high accuracy if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual. The proposed approach can be used as a digital CGM 'fingerprint' or for detecting glycaemic changes within an individual, for example during intercurrent illness."

The latest continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology allows people to observe glucose in real-time. However, an accurate glucose forecast remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce GluNet, a framework that leverages on a personalized deep neural network to predict the probabilistic distribution of short-term (30–60 minutes) future CGM measurements for subjects with T1D based on their historical data including glucose measurements, meal information, insulin doses, and other factors. It adopts the latest deep learning techniques consisting of four components: data pre-processing, label transform/recover, multi-layers of dilated convolution neural network (CNN), and post-processing. The method is evaluated in-silico for both adult and adolescent subjects. The results show significant improvements over existing methods in the literature through a comprehensive comparison in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) ( $\text{8.88} \pm \text{0.77}$ mg/dL) with short time lag ( $\text{0.83}\pm \text{0.40}$ minutes) for prediction horizons (PH) = 30 mins (minutes), and RMSE ( $\text{19.90} \pm \text{3.17}$ mg/dL) with time lag ( $\text{16.43}\pm \text{4.07}$ mins) for PH = 60 mins for virtual adult subjects. In addition, GluNet is also tested on two clinical data sets. Results show that it achieves an RMSE ( $\text{19.28} \pm \text{2.76}$  mg/dL) with time lag ( $\text{8.03}\pm \text{4.07}$ mins) for PH = 30 mins and an RMSE ( $\text{31.83} \pm \text{3.49}$ mg/dL) with time lag ( $\text{17.78}\pm \text{8.00}$  mins) for PH = 60 mins. These are the best reported results for glucose forecasting when compared with other methods including the neural network for predicting glucose (NNPG), the support vector regression (SVR), the latent variable with exogenous input (LVX), and the auto regression with exogenous input (ARX) algorithm."

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers an opportunity for patients with diabetes to modify their lifestyle to better manage their condition and for clinicians to provide personalized healthcare and lifestyle advice. However, analytic tools are needed to standardize and analyze the rich data that emerge from CGM devices. This would allow glucotypes of patients to be identified to aid clinical decision-making. Methods. In this paper, we develop an analysis pipeline for CGM data and apply it to 148 diabetic patients with a total of 8632 days of follow up. The pipeline projects CGM data to a lower-dimensional space of features representing centrality, spread, size, and duration of glycemic excursions and the circadian cycle. We then use principal components analysis and k-means to cluster patients’ records into one of four glucotypes and analyze cluster membership using multinomial logistic regression. Results. Glucotypes differ in the degree of control, amount of time spent in range, and on the presence and timing of hyper- and hypoglycemia. Patients on the program had statistically significant improvements in their glucose levels. Conclusions. This pipeline provides a fast automatic function to label raw CGM data without manual input."

People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can live a productive life if they receive proper diabetes care. Nonetheless, a loose glycemic control might increase the risk of developing hypoglycemia. This incident can occur because of a variety of causes, such as taking additional doses of insulin, skipping meals, or overexercising. Mainly, the symptoms of hypoglycemia range from mild dysphoria to more severe conditions, if not detected in a timely manner. Objective In this review, we aimed to report on innovative detection techniques and tactics for identifying and preventing hypoglycemic episodes, focusing on T1D. Methods A systematic literature search following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was performed focusing on the PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library to find articles on technologies related to hypoglycemia detection in patients with T1D. Results The presented approaches have been used or devised to enhance blood glucose monitoring and boost its efficacy in forecasting future glucose levels, which could aid the prediction of future episodes of hypoglycemia. We detected 19 predictive models for hypoglycemia, specifically on T1D, using a wide range of algorithmic methodologies, spanning from statistics (1.9/19, 10%) to machine learning (9.88/19, 52%) and deep learning (7.22/19, 38%). The algorithms used most were the Kalman filtering and classification models (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests). The performance of the predictive models was found to be satisfactory overall, reaching accuracies between 70% and 99%, which proves that such technologies are capable of facilitating the prediction of T1D hypoglycemia. Conclusions It is evident that continuous glucose monitoring can improve glucose control in diabetes; however, predictive models for hypo- and hyperglycemia using only mainstream noninvasive sensors such as wristbands and smartwatches are foreseen to be the next step for mobile health in T1D. Prospective studies are required to demonstrate the value of such models in real-life mobile health interventions."

We achieved the multimodal …","Abstract The accurate prediction of blood glucose is critical for the effective management of diabetes. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population.

DM impacted 463 million individuals worldwide in 2019, with over four million fatalities documented. Blood glucose levels (BGL) are usually measured, as standard protocols, through invasive procedures. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques have demonstrated the potential to estimate BGL using data collected by non-invasive Wearable Devices (WDs), thereby, facilitating monitoring and management of diabetics. One of the key aspects of WDs with machine learning (ML) algorithms is to find specific data signatures, called Digital biomarkers, that can be used in classification or gaging the extent of the underlying condition. The use of such biomarkers to monitor glycemic events represents a major shift in technology for self-monitoring and developing digital biomarkers using non-invasive WDs. To do this, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between characteristics acquired from non-invasive WDs and indicators of glycemic health; furthermore, much work is needed to validate accuracy. The study aimed to investigate performance of AI models in estimating BGL among diabetic patients using non-invasive wearable devices data An open-source dataset was used which provided BGL readings, diabetic status (Diabetic or non-diabetic), heart rate, Blood oxygen level (SPO2), Diastolic Blood pressure, Systolic Blood Pressure, Body temperature, Sweating, and Shivering for 13 participants by age group taken from WDs. Our experimental design included Data Collection, Feature Engineering, ML model selection/development, and reporting evaluation of metrics. We were able to estimate with high accuracy (RMSE range: 0.099 to 0.197) the relationship between glycemic metrics and features that can be derived from non-invasive WDs when utilizing AI models. We provide further evidence of the feasibility of using commercially available WDs for the purpose of BGL estimation amongst diabetics. "
