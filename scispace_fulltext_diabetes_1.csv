 Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by excess sugar in the blood and affects 422 million people worldwide, including 3.3 million in France. One of the frequent complications of diabetes is diabetic retinopathy (DR): it is the leading cause of blindness in the working population of developed countries. As a result, ophthalmology is on the verge of a revolution in screening, diagnosing, and managing of pathologies. This upheaval is led by the arrival of technologies based on artificial intelligence. The ""Evaluation intelligente de la rétinopathie diabétique"" (EviRed) project uses artificial intelligence to answer a medical need: replacing the current classification of diabetic retinopathy which is mainly based on outdated fundus photography and providing an insufficient prediction precision. EviRed exploits modern fundus imaging devices and artificial intelligence to properly integrate the vast amount of data they provide with other available medical data of the patient. The goal is to improve diagnosis and prediction and help ophthalmologists to make better decisions during diabetic retinopathy follow-up. In this study, we investigate the fusion of different modalities acquired simultaneously with a PLEX® Elite 9000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc.

Methods:
 In this study, 151 OCT volumes from 64 diabetic patients were collected. This collection was divided as follows: 88 acquisitions (from 31 patients) for training, 28 acquisitions (from 14 patients) for validation and 35 acquisitions (from 19 patients) for testing. DR severity level, according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale (ICDR) scale, was graded by a retina specialist using fundus photographs: 30 acquisitions (including 16 in the train set, 5 in the validation set and 9 in the test set) had proliferative DR. Three fusion methods were evaluated: early fusion, intermediate fusion, and hierarchical fusion."

Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions. This review highlights current developments and outlines future directions to support the design of scalable, generalizable, and clinically applicable multimodal DL systems for DR detection. ","precision, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines with minimal dependence on pre-processing or labeled data. The results affirm that adversarial pre-training with unlabeled multimodal data can substantially improve generalization and detection precision in retinal disease screening systems. Deep Learning Techniques:
 Álvaro S. Hervella et al  proposed a novel self-supervised deep learning approach for diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading that utilizes unlabeled multimodal image pairsÐspeciőcally, color fundus retinography and ŕuorescein angiographyÐto improve model pre-training and generalization. Deep Learning Techniques:
 The proposed method, termed Multimodal Image Encoding (MIE), uses a custom encoder-decoder architecture built upon VGG-based convolutional layers, designed to disentangle and learn both shared and exclusive features between modalities through two supervised branches: one reconstructs the target modality and the other reconstructs the input. Deep Learning Techniques:
 The fusion strategy employed is a multitask self-supervised early fusion, wherein complementary information from both modalities is leveraged during pre-training without needing labeled data. This pre-trained model is later őne-tuned on standard DR grading tasks using only fundus images. Deep Learning Techniques:
 The results, evaluated across multiple public datasets (IDRiD, Messidor, EyePACS-Kaggle), showed that MIE outperformed standard transfer learning approaches such as ImageNet pre-training and previous multimodal self-supervised methods. Deep Learning Techniques:
 Notably, the model achieved top performance in DR classiőcation tasks with Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) scores up to 89.7, DR AUC up to 94.22, and referable DR AUC up to 97.4, validating the effectiveness of domain-speciőc multimodal pre-training for retinal image analysis. Deep Learning Techniques:
 Yutong Yan et al  proposed a deep learning-based framework for detecting early-stage severity changes in diabetic retinopathy (DR) using longitudinal fundus images. Deep Learning Techniques:
 The model employs VGG16 and InceptionV4 convolutional backbones and integrates three fusion techniquesÐearly fusion (input-level image concatenation), intermediate fusion (feature-level integration using Spatial Transformer Networks), and late fusion (decision-level fusion of feature vectors via a Siamese network). Deep Learning Techniques:
 The multimodal data consists of pairs of color fundus photographs (CFP) from two consecutive clinical visits of the same patient, drawn from the large-scale OPHDIAT database. Deep Learning Techniques:
 The late fusion approach proved most effective, achieving the highest performance with AUC = 0.9296 and accuracy = 0.8696 using VGG16, and AUC = 0.9293 and accuracy = 0.8756 with InceptionV4, significantly outperforming early and intermediate fusion strategies. Deep Learning Techniques:
 The study highlights that late fusion is robust to spatial misalignment between time-series images and provides a scalable solution for incorporating prior patient data in DR severity progression analysis."

These sensors provide in real-time, every 1–5 min, the current blood glucose concentration and its rate-of-change, two key pieces of information for improving the determination of exogenous insulin administration and the prediction of forthcoming adverse events, such as hypo-/hyper-glycemia. The current research in diabetes technology is putting considerable effort into developing decision support systems for patient use, which automatically analyze the patient’s data collected by CGM sensors and other portable devices, as well as providing personalized recommendations about therapy adjustments to patients. Due to the large amount of data collected by patients with T1D and their variety, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being adopted in these decision support systems. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methodologies using AI and CGM sensors for decision support in advanced T1D management, including techniques for personalized insulin bolus calculation, adaptive tuning of bolus calculator parameters and glucose prediction.","of high glucose, a correction insulin bolus. Since 2015, some rtCGM devices have also received regulatory approval for therapeutic use, which means that rtCGM measurements may be used for making therapeutic decisions, such as insulin dosing . Standard Type 1 Diabetes Therapy and Margins for Improvement Using New Technologies:
 In addition to glucose monitoring systems, patients with T1D can also benefit from the use of insulin delivery devices. Insulin pumps are wearable medical devices that inject rapid-acting insulin into the subcutaneous tissue (for example, of the abdomen, the back, or the arm) almost continuously through a cannula connected to a refillable reservoir of insulin in the pump. Remarkably, some insulin pumps can be integrated with rtCGM sensors into the so-called closed-loop (or artificial pancreas) system, in which a control algorithm automatically adjusts the insulin dose based on the glucose concentration measured . Nevertheless, the use of an insulin pump may prove to be burdensome for some patients , and the majority of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes still rely on multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy, in which the patient manually injects insulin doses using insulin pens or syringes. A new generation of insulin pens for MDI therapy was introduced in 2017, smart insulin pens, which are able to record the amount and timing of each insulin dose and wirelessly transmit the information, via Bluetooth, to a dedicated mobile app . Smart pens can also provide the user with reminders should a dose be missed, with potential benefits for glycemic control. Standard Type 1 Diabetes Therapy and Margins for Improvement Using New Technologies:
 The increasing availability of information offered by wearable devices, such as CGM sensors, insulin pumps, smart pens, and activity trackers, is making the decision-making process increasingly complex. Current research in diabetes is putting considerable effort into developing algorithms and software applications to enhance T1D therapy by exploiting the latest technologies and their interoperability. One of these applications is decision support systems (DSSs) for advanced diabetes management [24], i.e., tools that can assist the patient and/or the doctor during the decision-making process by automatically analyzing the patient's data and providing personalized recommendations about therapy adjustments. The large amount of data that can be acquired from patients with diabetes makes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques particularly attractive for developing diabetes DSSs . Standard Type 1 Diabetes Therapy and Margins for Improvement Using New Technologies:
 The aim of this paper is to provide a narrative overview of the latest progresses in the development of DSSs for advanced T1D management using AI and rtCGM sensor data. Although in this review, we focus on rtCGM sensors, which we will henceforth call simply CGM, most of the concepts apply to FGM as well. In Section 2, the concept of DSS for advanced T1D management will be presented. Sections 3-5 will review the state-of-the-art algorithms proposed for the 3 main tasks of a DSS for advanced T1D management, that are personalized insulin bolus calculation, adaptive tuning of BC parameters and glucose prediction. Note that this article is not a systematic literature review, rather a narrative review of those state-of-the-art AI-based approaches that, according to our experience as investigators active in diabetes technology research, are most relevant in the field of T1D DSSs for patient use."

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.","16%).

Statistical evaluation of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm (n=37). Principal Findings: This was the first study of its kind to the best of our knowledge, considering the amount of features we were able to extract from each publication. The features extracted should give researchers insight not only into the technologies that are readily available commercially but also into what is possible in the future with studies we identified that developed prototypes. Our findings shed light on this emerging field, which is still in its infancy. This is further highlighted by the fact that 59% (22/37) of the studies that met our inclusion criteria were prototypes; we were only able to identify 41% as commercially available (as demonstrated in Multimedia Appendix 6) devices, of which only (7/15, 46%) studies performed some sort of ML classification on the extracted data directly from WDs, whereas (6/15, 40%) studies made use of neural network-based models with classification to make out of already collected data. Most of these measured blood glucose on wrist-worn devices and used a classification algorithm (Figure ). Classification models were widely used (Figure ) in the reviewed studies, largely owing to studies attempting to classify types of diabetes (T1D, T2D, etc). SVM and random forest were the most prevalent classifiers and exhibited the highest performance. SVM is extensively used because of its superiority in generalization and nonlinear function fitting, and it also has a number of advantages when dealing with small-sample studies . Furthermore, SVM is a binary classifier, and we observed that it is mostly used on blood glucose level data to determine levels for diabetes categorization. Aside from the accuracy for demonstrating efficacy, the Clarke Error Grid was the most commonly used performance metric, possibly because of its popularity as a performance metric for assessing blood glucose estimation. The grid was split into 5 zones, each with varied prediction accuracy between the estimated and reference blood glucose readings. The data fell within zone A, which pertains to precise glucose calculations, where each consecutive zone is thought to have progressively substantial erroneous estimations . Most of the sensory data being collected especially when looking at commercially available devices, did not require any further or minimal input from the user, meaning the person with diabetes can get on with day-to-day tasks without having to worry about taking regular invasive finger pricks for monitoring glucose levels; for example, while still feeling that they are wearing a stylish item such as a smartwatch. We specifically examined studies after 2015, as previous studies related to the use of WDs found that most wearables were used in this range . One of the reasons may be that Fitbit released its first device in 2009 and the Apple Watch followed in 2015; both these devices set the tone for WDs, and it is not surprising that 59% (22/37) from our review were wrist-worn. A total of 78% (29/37) of the devices were connected to either a gateway or host device, usually a smartphone (16/37, 43%) via either Bluetooth (19/37, 51%) or Wi-Fi or internet (6/37, 16%); this is likely owing to the fact that web-based data are now more affordable and the availability of low energy connectivity technology such as Bluetooth. This ability to connect has resulted in more analytics and data storage being possible on host devices than on smartphones or directly on the cloud (18/37, 49%) of studies in this review, compared with limited computing power on the WD"

This could be important in developing an advanced tele-screening system for diabetic retinopathy. Methods A DLS with a convolutional neural network was developed to recognize fundus images of referable diabetic retinopathy. A total data set of 41,866 color fundus images were obtained from 17 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). Five experienced retinal specialists and 15 ophthalmologists were recruited to verify images. For training, 80% of the data set was used, and the other 20% served as the validation data set. To effectively understand the learning process, the DLS automatically superimposed a heatmap on the original image. The regions utilized by the DLS were highlighted for diagnosis. Results Using the local validation data set, the DLS achieved an area under the curve of 0.9824. Based on the manual screening criteria, an operating point was set at about 0.9 sensitivity to evaluate the DLS. Specificity was recorded at 0.9609 and sensitivity was 0.9003. The DLSs showed excellent reliability, repeatability, and high efficiency. After analyzing the misclassification, it was found that 88.6% of the false-positives were mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) whereas, 81.6% of the false-negatives were intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. Conclusions The DLS efficiently detected fundus images from complex sources in the real world. Incorporating DLS technology in tele-screening will advance the current screening programs to offer a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for detecting diabetic retinopathy.","Ren,Qianyi Lu,Enliang Zhou,Wangshu Yu,Jiani Huang,Xiaoying He,Wei Han (Corresponding Author) Keywords: Diabetic retinopathy, fundus image, deep learning system (DLS), artificial intelligence Introduction:
 Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its associated complications pose a major global health threat. The latest edition of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) diabetes atlas shows that 463 million adults aged 20-79 years had diabetes mellitus globally in 2019. This estimate is projected to rise to 578 million by 2030, and 700 million by 2045 . Introduction:
 Pharmacologic therapy including metformin and insulin remains standard therapy for DM. Currently, for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney Original Article disease, and heart failure, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor are considered as the best choice for a second agent . Based on drug-specific effects and patient factors, personalized combination therapy is increasingly advocated. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a serious complication that arises from DM, causing blindness and vision impairment in the working-age population across the globe , can be divided into two types: non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The global prevalence for DR ranges from 18% to 30% in type 2 diabetic patients, whereas, for PDR, the global prevalence ranges between 2.9% to 4.4% . Notably, China has the highest number of DM patients in the world with about 116.4 million cases . The prevalence rates are 18.45% for DR, 15.06% for NPDR, and 0.99% for PDR. In addition, DM patients from rural areas in China have been shown to have a higher risk of developing DR than those in urban areas . Introduction:
 The diagnosis of DR contains all features of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation, including history, eye clinical examination and a number of tests ancillary to the clinical examination . Particularly, the ancillary imaging tests can unveiling vital information not detectable to the clinical examination. Currently, the application of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has added a new perspective on our understanding of diabetic retinopathy by detecting preclinical microvascular changes, quantifying regions of macular nonperfusion and identify retinal neovascular tissue . However, fundus photography is the most widespread diagnosis and screening method by recording retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is treatable at its early stages. Annual DR screening for diabetic patients is recommended by many guidelines . Governments and foundations have provided hospitals in China with screening services. However, a nationwide traditional screening system that relies on in-person dilated eye examination remains impractical. This is as a result of inadequate funds, access issues, and few trained eye care personnel. There is a need to devise new effective screening strategies to curb the rapidly increasing burden of diabetes."

This paper aims to validate an AI algorithm for identifying and quantifying different major optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers in DME eyes by comparing the algorithm to human expert manual examination. Intraretinal (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) detection and volumes, external limiting-membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) integrity, and hyperreflective retina foci (HRF) quantification were analyzed. Three-hundred three DME eyes were included. The mean central subfield thickness was 386.5 ± 130.2 µm. IRF was present in all eyes and confirmed by AI software. The agreement (kappa value) (95% confidence interval) for SRF presence and ELM and EZ interruption were 0.831 (0.738–0.924), 0.934 (0.886–0.982), and 0.936 (0.894–0.977), respectively. The accuracy of the automatic quantification of IRF, SRF, ELM, and EZ ranged between 94.7% and 95.7%, while accuracy of quality parameters ranged between 99.0% (OCT layer segmentation) and 100.0% (fovea centering). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient between clinical and automated HRF count was excellent (0.97). This AI algorithm provides a reliable and reproducible assessment of the most relevant OCT biomarkers in DME. It may allow clinicians to routinely identify and quantify these parameters, offering an objective way of diagnosing and following DME eyes.","to provide objective and reproducible measurements of quantitative features. Discussion: AI has been successfully used for diabetic retinopathy screening, using fundus photos, even if with variable protocols, allowing early detection, with the subsequent reduction in blindness and cost savings . Discussion:
 AI previous algorithms have been considered to follow changes of IRF and SRF volumes over time, which may aid clinicians to assess disease activity and treatment response . Although it is incredibly difficult to make comparisons between different algorithms used in the different studies, our results about an AI quantification approach have shown excellent accuracy and reproducibility of this AI algorithm in DME. Furthermore, this AI software simultaneously provides the quantification of the currently most recognized biomarkers in DME. A number of other OCT biomarkers have been proposed in the literature, e.g., the disorganization of inner retinal layers (DRIL); however, the biomarkers analyzed by the reported AI software were the ones with the most robust evidence in terms of physiopathological and clinical meaning and defined OCT characteristics for detection. Finally, our findings clearly confirmed a center and operator independence. Discussion:
 The main purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of this AI algorithm for quantifying OCT biomarkers in DME, but it has not yet been applied on follow-up data of the same eyes obtained from different time points. This subject will be addressed in the ongoing follow-up study in order to analyze the performance of monitoring modifications of biomarkers over time, with the possible onset, for example, of more significant atrophic changes, which may represent a challenging issue for clinical practice. Another limitation of the study is that it did not evaluate any relationship between OCT and functional outcomes or other morphologic parameters. In fact, the aim of the study was to investigate the performance of the AI software in comparison with clinical evaluation by analyzing the most recognized DME biomarkers in the currently most frequently used scans (map and linear) in clinical practice. Conclusions:
 results of this study suggest that the proposed AI algorithm is a reliable and reproducible tool for detecting and quantifying different OCT biomarkers in DME eyes, which is currently considered prognostic even for the treatment outcomes. Conclusions:
 Artificial intelligence may facilitate the quantification of these biomarkers in daily practice since it has been shown to be as accurate and precise as clinical evaluation but less time-consuming. Further studies are needed to implement this AI software in large real-world settings to assess changes over time and the clinical relationship between those changes and the course of the disease."

Task-specific approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning, attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient populations.

Age-related Macular Degeneration Diagnosis: Additionally, Chen et al. proposed the M3 framework (Multi-modal, Multi-task, Multi-attention), which introduces self-attention and cross-modal attention mechanisms, enables automated detection of RPD. Age-related Macular Degeneration Diagnosis:
 RPD, an important marker of AMD progression, is difficult to identify in traditional CFP, but this method, combined with FAF image information, enables even primary healthcare institutions with only CFP capabilities to achieve high-precision RPD identification. Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by optic nerve damage and visual field defects, and it is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 Its pathogenesis is complex, and early symptoms are often subtle, leading to diagnosis typically occurring only when the disease has progressed to the moderateto-late stages. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on optic disc structure analysis, visual field testing, and intraocular pressure measurement. Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 However, due to significant anatomical variability among individuals and the subjective nature of visual field testing, misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses are common in clinical practice. Additionally, long-term follow-up management of glaucoma patients faces challenges in monitoring changes in both structural and functional indicators . Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 In response to the aforementioned challenges, researchers have gradually explored new approaches combining multimodal imaging data with deep learning. Mehta et al.  developed a multimodal machine learning model integrating OCT, CFP images, and demographic and clinical data, thereby improving the accuracy of early glaucoma detection. Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 Li et al.  compared three different multimodal information fusion strategies (early fusion, mid-fusion, and hierarchical fusion), finding that the hierarchical fusion strategy performed best on the GAMMA dataset, effectively addressing the complementarity and correlation between modalities. Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 Zhou et al.  proposed the MM-RAF framework based on the Transformer architecture, incorporating bilateral contrast alignment (BCA), multi-instance learning representation (MILR), and hierarchical attention fusion (HAF) modules to overcome the insufficient interaction of spatial information between different modalities, significantly enhancing the robustness of glaucoma identification. Glaucoma Diagnosis:
 Meanwhile, the GAMMA Challenge organized by Wu et al.  has driven the development of glaucoma grading algorithms, with the 3D-DEN dual-branch architecture and multi-model integration strategy adopted by participating teams demonstrating excellent performance on multimodal data. Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis:
 DR is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes, and severe cases can lead to vision loss or even blindness. Its pathological process includes retinal microvascular leakage and neovascularization, requiring regular screening through fundus photography, OCTA, and other methods. Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis:
 However, the grading standards for DR are complex, manual image interpretation is inefficient, and existing automated screening systems have limitations in multi-modal data processing, particularly in terms of generalization ability on small datasets. Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis:
 Hua et al.  proposed the TFA-Net model, which integrates fundus images with SS-OCTA data. By utilizing weight-sharing convolutional kernels and reverse cross-attention (RCA) streams to enhance feature representation, the model significantly improves DR classification performance on small datasets."

By combining information from multiple sources, clinicians are able to make more accurate judgments. In recent years, multiple imaging techniques have been used in clinical practice for retinal analysis: 2D fundus photographs, 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) and 3D OCT angiography, etc. Our paper investigates three multimodal information fusion strategies based on deep learning to solve retinal analysis tasks: early fusion, intermediate fusion, and hierarchical fusion. The commonly used early and intermediate fusions are simple but do not fully exploit the complementary information between modalities. We developed a hierarchical fusion approach that focuses on combining features across multiple dimensions of the network, as well as exploring the correlation between modalities. These approaches were applied to glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy classification, using the public GAMMA dataset (fundus photographs and OCT) and a private dataset of PlexElite 9000 (Carl Zeis Meditec Inc.) OCT angiography acquisitions, respectively. Our hierarchical fusion method performed the best in both cases and paved the way for better clinical diagnosis.

This requires patients to be aware of their blood glucose level oscillations every day to deduce a pattern and anticipate future glycemia, and hence, decide the amount of insulin that must be exogenously injected to maintain glycemia within the target range. This approach often suffers from a relatively high imprecision, which can be dangerous. Nevertheless, current developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and innovative sensors for biological signals that might enable a continuous, complete assessment of the patient’s health provide a fresh viewpoint on treating DM1. With this, we observe that current biomonitoring devices and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) units can easily obtain data that allow us to know at all times the state of glycemia and other variables that influence its oscillations. A complete review has been made of the variables that influence glycemia in a T1DM patient and that can be measured by the above means. The communications systems necessary to transfer the information collected to a more powerful computational environment, which can adequately handle the amounts of data collected, have also been described. From this point, intelligent data analysis extracts knowledge from the data and allows predictions to be made in order to anticipate risk situations. With all of the above, it is necessary to build a holistic proposal that allows the complete and smart management of T1DM. This approach evaluates a potential shortage of such suggestions and the obstacles that future intelligent IoMT-DM1 management systems must surmount. Lastly, we provide an outline of a comprehensive IoMT-based proposal for DM1 management that aims to address the limits of prior studies while also using the disruptive technologies highlighted before.","elderly, disabled, or children, the user experience must be pleasant, which can be achieved through customization; • Privacy, security, integrity. This work uses ICT frameworks and processes personal data . Thus, control methods are needed to handle sensitive information properly . Conclusions:
 To create an ICT-based DM1 management system, numerous factors should be improved after analyzing the scientific literature. Studies have demonstrated that factors other than glycemia, insulin, and meals can alter glycemia patterns. Accelerometers track physical activity, which is thought to affect diabetes. Others, such as heart rate, exhaled breathing, temperature, sweat, and polarimetry, are also being investigated. Schedule and weekday effects are also well-known. Electronics have miniaturized and improved biometrics. Continuous heart rate, exercise, and other measurements are possible. This study covers DM1 management. Conclusions:
 In addition, ICT advances such as Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 6LowPAN, and BLE offer multiple communication paths, and joining machine learning algorithms lets us develop software models of system dynamics, predict glucose, optimize the solution, and manage CGMinsulin pump information. Conclusions:
 Machine learning algorithms need continuous biological data to calibrate the models and forecast glycemia for different patients. To avoid erroneous forecasts and undesirable outcomes, the model must adapt to patient health and routine. Fortunately, early development of an IoT-based solution would help collect data and allow supervised patient testing, decreasing risks. Conclusions:
 In conclusion, the primary contribution that this study makes is a compilation of the components that are required to carry out effective management of T1DM within an IoMT context. It takes into account the options that have been provided in this sense by other methods of health care and re-examines the particular biomonitoring devices that are helpful for T1DM, assessing the influence of the biological variables that are assessed. After this, a comprehensive solution is found by taking into account the various modes of data transmission and the various forms of AI technology, and then future problems that need to be handled are presented. Conclusions:
 Our perspective on the world continues to evolve toward new frontiers as a result of technological advancement. In many ways, life has become simpler due to the many innovations that might be deemed revolutionary. As two prominent examples, CGM systems and insulin pumps have enabled significant progress in the quest for a comprehensive and definitive method of diabetes regulation. However, the entire potential of this new technology has not yet been realized, and the research should generate new approaches in the future. This study evaluated glycemia modeling architectures in order to determine the function that IoT may play in the management of DM1."

Detection of DR requires substantial human resources and high medical costs. Therefore, the use of diagnostic software has been recently explored. The study aimed to assess the results of DR diagnoses by Cybersight, an artificial intelligence software. A total of 1,012 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (1,943 eyes) with a mean age of 74.61 ± 6.73 years were included. Comprehensive demographic and clinical data were gathered, and all patients underwent color fundus photography following Cybersight's standardized protocols. The study compared Cybersight's accuracy with that of ophthalmologists in identifying key DR lesions, including retinal microvascular changes, exudates, hemorrhages, the diagnosis and staging of DR, using sensitivity, specificity, and weighted Kappa metrics. The prevalence of DR was 16.2%. A high level of agreement was found between Cybersight and ophthalmologists in DR diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 85.0%, specificity of 95.8%, and a weighted Kappa of 0.78. The presence of cataracts and the degree of pupil dilation notably impacted on the accuracy of DR diagnosis. The results have important implications for the potential application of Cybersight as a low-cost and effective tool for diabetic eye screening. ","Trong, V. P., Quoc, T. M., Dang, M. D., Viet, Q.

 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent chronic disorder that affects glucose metabolism. It is estimated that, as of 2021, there were 530 million people worldwide living with diabetes, with projections indicating this number could rise to 1.3 billion by 2050 . Introduction:
 In Vietnam, the incidence of DM has surged to an estimated 7 million individuals, 50% of whom remain undiagnosed and untreated. By 2022, the prevalence of DM in the population had reached 7.3%, compared to 5.4% in 2012 . Introduction:
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by a few noticeable symptoms until it progresses to a severe stage . Without prompt detection and intervention, patients become vulnerable to potentially life-threatening complications, including infections, cardiovascular disorders, renal failure, nerve damage, and eye conditions . Introduction:
 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) stands out as a common complication that can lead to vision impairment and blindness among people with T2DM. A 2013 study in 33 countries revealed that the prevalence of DR in cases with known T2DM and newly diagnosed T2DM was 27.9% and 10.5%, respectively. Introduction:
 Notably, this rate was higher in developing countries compared to developed countries . Introduction:
 DR poses a significant risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality among individuals with T2DM. Therefore, early screening and diagnosis of DR are crucial . Introduction:
 In recent years, numerous studies have explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical applications, including diagnosis, disease monitoring, and treatment recommendations across various clinical conditions . Introduction:
 In the field of ophthalmology, AI has shown promise in detecting diseases such as retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy . Introduction:
 Despite the potential benefits of AI in diagnosing DR, its widespread implementation for initial detection is still limited . Introduction:
 In Vietnam and many developing countries where DM prevalence continues to escalate, most patients receive treatments focused on glycemic management but lack systematic screening for complications, including ophthalmic conditions, due to constraints such as a shortage of ophthalmologists and limited resources. Introduction:
 As a result, there is a growing need for accessible and efficient measures to support early detection of DR . Objectives:
 This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Cybersight, an AI software, in detecting DR among people with DM in an outpatient setting by comparing the performance of Cybersight with ophthalmologists' evaluations. Study Design and Sample:
 The present study was approved by the Scientific Committee of Hanoi Medical University on August 29, 2022, and obtained ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Hanoi Medical University (No. IRB-VN01.001/IRB00003121/FWA 00004148) on April 4, 2023. Study Design and Sample:

While current leading-edge transfer learning from pre-trained models can help with cases lacking data, it limits design choices, and generally results in the use of unnecessarily large models. We propose a novel, self-supervised training scheme for obtaining high-quality, pre-trained networks from unlabeled, cross-modal medical imaging data, which will allow for creating accurate and efficient models. We demonstrate this by accurately predicting optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based retinal thickness measurements from simple infrared (IR) fundus images. Subsequently, learned representations outperformed advanced classifiers on a separate diabetic retinopathy classification task in a scenario of scarce training data. Our cross-modal, three-staged scheme effectively replaced 26,343 diabetic retinopathy annotations with 1,009 semantic segmentations on OCT and reached the same classification accuracy using only 25% of fundus images, without any drawbacks, since OCT is not required for predictions. We expect this concept will also apply to other multimodal clinical data-imaging, health records, and genomics data, and be applicable to corresponding sample-starved learning problems.","in the fundus. However, subtle edemas are difficult to identify in fundus imaging only. Our results indicates that a large part of retinal thickness information is encoded in both modalities (OCT and IR fundus) (Fig. ) Discussion:
 In the final stage of this work (Fig. ), we showed that learning this shared, cross-modal information in a self-supervised manner is an effective approach for initializing a diabetic retinopathy classification model using color fundus images. Remarkably, our self-supervised network steadily outperformed random and ImageNet initializations by a significant margin, despite the fact that the model was derived from training on small-field-of-view infrared images (Fig. ). With only 25% of the training data, the DeepRT-initialized algorithm nearly recovered the full weighted accuracy reached, compared to training conducted on the complete data set, reducing labeling efforts by a factor of four. Specifically, we showed that the proposed three-stage process can replace 26,343 expert diabetic retinopathy annotations (Fig. ) over an equivalent, randomly initialized model, with 1,009 relatively simplistic semantic OCT annotations, which medical staff trained at a lower level can achieve accurately. In addition, the process also reached an even higher classification accuracy than leading-edge transfer learning from ImageNet, while allowing a 200-fold decrease in model size, which is critical for the mobile and on-device applications that are often necessary for deploying deep-learning models in real scenarios. These results are supported by work in the research community, which indicates that, in medical imaging, features of interest are often subtle, represented within small areas, and therefore difficult to discover. Furthermore, model architectures suitable for medical imaging problems appeared to be considerably different from those used on ImageNet, making general features and models learned from natural images less useful for increasing medical data efficiency.  Our model training strategy includes two other benefits over most multimodal approaches,  which are typically structured around absorbing multiple modalities in a single model, in order to improve classification accuracy. First, although our training strategy relied heavily on multimodal data sources, it used only OCT information for pre-training purposes. The final model operated completely independently of OCT data at inference time; that is, we did not require an OCT measurement as input for the final diabetic retinopathy prediction model, which operates on a single color fundus image. This presents the benefit that our training strategy does not present additional complexities for clinical application (e.g., data fusion, missing data, and increased runtime), which are associated with multimodal modeling approaches. Second, we were able to learn from disjointed data sources, in the sense that we were able to effectively use patient OCT information to improve color fundus models on a completely different data set, with no patient overlap. We expect that this indirect use of multimodal patient information in the form of self-supervision will be particularly useful for deep learning in the medical domain, where multiple measurement modalities, coupled with disjointed patient groups, render simultaneous inclusion in shared models impossible and, as a result, exclude important studies and data sets."

In diabetic patients, periodic examination of the back of the eye using a nonmydriatic camera has been widely demonstrated to be an effective system to control and prevent the onset of DR. Convolutional neural networks have been used to detect DR, achieving very high sensitivities and specificities. Objective: The objective of this is paper was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for the detection of signs of DR in diabetic patients and to scientifically validate the algorithm to be used as a screening tool in primary care. Methods: Under this project, 2 studies will be conducted in a concomitant way: (1) Development of an algorithm with AI to detect signs of DR in patients with diabetes and (2) A prospective study comparing the diagnostic capacity of the AI algorithm with respect to the actual system of family physicians evaluating the images. The standard reference to compare with will be a blinded double reading conducted by retina specialists. For the development of the AI algorithm, different iterations and workouts will be performed on the same set of data. Before starting each new workout, the strategy of dividing the set date into 2 groups will be used randomly. A group with 80% of the images will be used during the training (training dataset), and the remaining 20% images will be used to validate the results (validation dataset) of each cycle (epoch). During the prospective study, true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative values will be calculated again. From here, we will obtain the resulting confusion matrix and other indicators to measure the performance of the algorithm. Results: Cession of the images began at the end of 2018. The development of the AI algorithm is calculated to last about 3 to 4 months. Inclusion of patients in the cohort will start in early 2019 and is expected to last 3 to 4 months. Preliminary results are expected to be published by the end of 2019. Conclusions: The study will allow the development of an algorithm based on AI that can demonstrate an equal or superior performance, and that constitutes a complement or an alternative, to the current screening of DR in diabetic patients.

 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important causes of blindness worldwide, especially in the most developed countries . Up to 20% of type 2 diabetics have DR lesions at the time of diagnosis, and after 20 years of evolution of the illness, >60% of the patients have developed DR. The percentage of diabetic patients who have never undergone an ophthalmoscopic exploration exceeds 30% according to different studies . DR appears and evolves asymptomatically for years, and it is in the early stages (asymptomatic) when the treatments to avoid vision loss are really effective. With early detection, DR can be treated with techniques that have been shown to reduce the risk of severe vision loss by >90% . Introduction:
 Regularly examining the fundus of the eye of known diabetic patients using a nonmydriatic camera has been widely shown to be an effective system to control and prevent the onset of DR . Nonmydriatic retinal photography is a good alternative to direct ophthalmoscopy for the screening of DR; it offers high sensitivity and specificity (87% and 97%, respectively), simplicity of the technique, greater accessibility, ease in the registration of information (the computerized file that allows the evolutionary monitoring of the lesions), and better cost-effectiveness ratio compared with the ophthalmoscopy method with pupillary dilatation . Introduction:
 On the other hand, in recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to the classification of medical images through deep learning techniques using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) . In some cases, performances comparable to those obtained using specialist physicians have been reported . These CNNs have also been used for the detection of DR, obtaining high sensitivities and specificities  with accuracies of up to 97.71% . A recent study has reported a sensitivity and specificity of 92.5% and 98.5%, respectively. In this study, 85.6% of false-positive cases were due to a misclassification of mild or moderate DR and 77.3% of all false-negative cases occurred for undetected intraretinal microvascular abnormalities . However, none of these algorithms have been developed with a population from southern Europe. Introduction:
 The current state-of-the-art screening for AI systems for medical images like the fundus images is a combination of AI technology (deep learning system) connected to a reading center with a board of retinal experts to confirm the positive cases diagnosed by the deep learning system and optimized to achieve high sensitivities. An AI system incorporated into routine clinical practice to detect DR is currently being beta-tested by the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program . Introduction:

Due to the progressive nature of the disease, earlier detection and timely treatment can lead to substantial reductions in the incidence of irreversible vision-loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) screening systems have offered clinically acceptable and quicker results in detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant investigations was performed to document the performance of AI screening systems that were applied to fundus and OCT images of patients from diverse geographic locations including North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. A systematic literature search on Medline, Global Health, and PubMed was performed and studies published between October 2015 and January 2020 were included. The search strategy was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, and AI-based investigations were mandatory for studies inclusion. The abstracts, titles, and full-texts of potentially eligible studies were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review; 18 met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of the evaluated AI screening systems in detecting diabetic retinopathy was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92-0.94) and the specificity was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.89). The included studies detailed training and external validation datasets, criteria for diabetic retinopathy case ascertainment, imaging modalities, DR-grading scales, and compared AI results to those of human graders (e.g., ophthalmologists, retinal specialists, trained nurses, and other healthcare providers) as a reference standard. The findings of this study showed that the majority AI screening systems demonstrated clinically acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus and OCT photographs. Further improvement depends on the continual development of novel algorithms with large and gradable sets of images for training and validation. If cost-effectiveness ratios can be optimized, AI can become a financially sustainable and clinically effective intervention that can be incorporated into the healthcare systems of low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) and geographically remote locations. Combining screening technologies with treatment interventions such as anti-VEGF therapy, acellular capillary laser treatment, and vitreoretinal surgery can lead to substantial reductions in the incidence of irreversible vision-loss due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","ETDRS. However, because ICDRS is easier and more commonly used in clinical settings, it may be preferable to consider ICDRS criteria when developing, testing, and validating automated screening systems, though ETDRS is still treated as the gold standard. Discussion:
 With regard to imaging modalities, the majority of studies that have and currently investigate AI screening performance use fundus photography as the modality of choice and a smaller number utilize OCT imaging. Fundus photography produces a two-dimensional image of the three-dimensional structure of the retina, while OCT captures the cross-sectional axial of the retina through light coherence. The main shortcoming of using fundus photography for screening is that it only produces two-dimensional images, while the structure of the retina is three-dimensional. For this reason, it is advantageous to use OCT for diabetic retinopathy visualization as OCT can produce clear three-dimensional images of thick samples by rejecting background signals while collecting light directly reflected from retinal surfaces. Thus, researchers should focus on training algorithms to interpret OCT images in order to better screen for diabetic retinopathy. Alternatively, training neural networks to recognize and analyze both OCT and fundus images might lead to higher screening performance. Discussion:
 A comprehensive literature search was conducted in global health and biomedical databases. High quality studies that met a specific set of eligibility criteria were included in this study. Performance metrics of sensitivity and specificity were meta-analyzed to assess the performance of diverse AI screening systems. The heterogeneity of results was also graphically demonstrated through forest plot and SROC curve analyses. Limitations for review:
 This review possesses several limitations that must be considered. First, in the subgroup analyses assessing the sensitivity and specificity of AI screening systems, only one study contributed results to the AlexNet, IDP, and Inception V4 subgroups. Reporting performance levels based on a limited number of studies weakens the credibility of this study's meta-analytic findings. Second, several studies used the same datasets for training and validation of their respective AI screening systems. Assessing the impact of using overlapping data sources on the outcome of the results is challenging to evaluate because the contents of each dataset was not discussed in the included studies. Third, CNNs lack standardized cut-off points or thresholds with which to designate the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Due to such an absence, this review could not make strong comparisons between their abilities to screen for disease severity. Fourth, there was a strong risk of selection bias amongst the included studies with regard to participant recruitment. It is unclear whether participant data was included in multiple datasets, so the overall performance metrics may be underestimated or overestimated due to potential changes in said participants' severities of diabetic retinopathy between data sources."

Although there are multiple biosensing platforms for monitoring glucose available on the market, there is still a strong need to enhance their precision, repeatability, wearability, and accessibility to end-users. Biosensing technologies are being increasingly explored that use different bodily fluids such as sweat and tear fluid, etc., that can be calibrated to and therefore used to measure blood glucose concentrations accurately. To improve the wearability of these devices, exploring different fluids as testing mediums is essential and opens the door to various implants and wearables that in turn have the potential to be less inhibiting to the wearer. Recent developments have surfaced in the form of contact lenses or mouthguards for instance. Challenges still present themselves in the form of sensitivity, especially at very high or low glucose concentrations, which is critical for a diabetic person to monitor. This review summarises advances in wearable glucose biosensors over the past 5 years, comparing the different types as well as the fluid they use to detect glucose, including the CGMs currently available on the market. Perspectives on the development of wearables for glucose biosensing are discussed.","do they necessarily have access to the required funds for these devices that could offer a better quality of life for people with diabetes. It is, therefore, a priority to produce new, low-cost but effective and accurate devices that will be accessible to all. COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CGMS:
 The recent Medtronic Guardian Connect shows promising developments, not only in its small number of components (sensor and transmitter only) but also its predictive technology that allows the user to learn more about environmental factors that affect them, as well as machine learning inclusion which allows for prediction of lows and highs a lot sooner than other devices that give real-time alerts. However, it must be noted that the high price of this new technology which means its access will be limited for most users, as well as its smaller age window for users. Thus, it is in high demand to develop wearables devices to continuously monitor the glucose levels in a non-invasive, costeffective, and friendly to end-users fashion. CHALLENGES AND PERSPECTIVES:
 Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce. As one of the four major types of noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and cancer), diabetes continuous to cause a huge burden to the community globally. The WHO indicates that 85% of diabetics deaths occur in developing countries and a major reason is the lack of testing and monitoring equipment (WHO, 2021). Thus, lots of efforts have been invested to develop novel assays and device for diagnosis, treatment, management and prevention of diabetes. Detection of glucose in blood is still the golden standard method for diabetes diagnosis and management. In additional to blood, saliva, urine, sweat, interstitial fluids, and tears are also body fluids in which glucose is present in different levels, and glucose concentration in some fluids are coordinated with that in serum . Currently, CGMs link with automated insulin delivery and thus accuracy of CGM devices is critical for delivering the right amount of insulin to patients . CHALLENGES AND PERSPECTIVES:
 With the development of nanotechnology, advanced materials and biomedical engineering, wearable sensing devices have been keeping on attracting wide attention in monitoring health conditions in real-time.

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future. Trial Registration PROSPERO CRD42022303175; https://tinyurl.com/3n9jaayc","searches, such as Fitbit and Apple Watch, were not included as this would return too many irrelevant results; this is in line with previous review search strategies. However, as a result, some relevant studies may have been missed in the search. Practical and Research Implications:
 There are several practical and research implications for this work. For practical implications, we find that noninvasive methods for calculating BG levels for people with diabetes to forecast BG levels are a much-welcomed advancement in this field. The ability to have such sensors on WDs that can be both stylish and fashionable, the ability to be paired with other smart devices, and general connectivity to clouds allows for continuous collection of data using many biosensors. This allows the measurement of vitals and biosignals without user interference; all of these reasons allow for a wider acceptance than existing traditional approaches such as continuous glucose monitoring. Despite the fact that there have been many studies published using WDs for diabetes, we found a lack of those that reported usage of ML and only a handful used for the purpose of BG forecasting. Although the number of studies reported in this paper is small, there is great promise due to the general quality assessment, including the accuracy levels of the ML approaches used at high levels. We see that a lot of studies are still developing their prototypes, whereas the existing commercially available devices that have already been thoroughly tested for usability and are already popular products on the market can easily be repurposed. Commercial devices are waiting to be validated with ML applications by researchers and reported in scientific journals; a quick search on retail sites reveals many commercial devices that claim to measure BG levels but have no associated studies. Adapting these existing devices would instill consumer confidence if engineers and data scientists came together and further validated these devices by reporting their effectiveness when ML techniques are applied to the generated data. Currently, there is no standard way studies are reporting performance and accuracy. Even when papers report high accuracy, this can be misleading, as from a clinical perspective, it is not important when BG levels are normal or around the normal band; the real applicability of the algorithm is in the glycemic event range. Therefore, the accuracy of these algorithms needs to be measured and reported in the range where it matters. Studies need to report these findings and not just average accuracies, providing readers with more clinically meaningful metrics. We feel it is high time that devices often classified as WDs, such as continuous glucose monitoring, which are still semi-invasive, should be less of a focus, and that studies should now focus on completely noninvasive devices, such as commercially available smart watches that make use of noninvasive sensors. There are also many opportunities within the IoT field; again, we feel there could be more integration of WDs used for BG monitoring with existing technologies and ML with Alexa, Google Homes, and Apple Watches. This could allow endless opportunities for gathering data from multiple sensors in real-time and personal patient data. Of course, the issue of privacy and data sovereignty needs to be taken seriously when it comes to mass data storage on cloud-based systems and the various interconnected devices, hospital datacenters, and consent legal and moral obligations. A multidisciplinary effort from medical practitioners, engineers, and legal experts is needed."

For most persons living with T1D, the determination of insulin delivery is based on a single measured parameter—glucose. To date, wearable sensors exist that enable the seamless, noninvasive, and low-cost monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. Objective The objective of this literature survey is to explore whether some of the physiological parameters that can be monitored with noninvasive, wearable sensors may be used to enhance T1D management. Methods A list of physiological parameters, which can be monitored by using wearable sensors available in 2020, was compiled by a thorough review of the devices available in the market. A literature survey was performed using search terms related to T1D combined with the identified physiological parameters. The selected publications were restricted to human studies, which had at least their abstracts available. The PubMed and Scopus databases were interrogated. In total, 77 articles were retained and analyzed based on the following two axes: the reported relations between these parameters and T1D, which were found by comparing persons with T1D and healthy control participants, and the potential areas for T1D enhancement via the further analysis of the found relationships in studies working within T1D cohorts. Results On the basis of our search methodology, 626 articles were returned, and after applying our exclusion criteria, 77 (12.3%) articles were retained. Physiological parameters with potential for monitoring by using noninvasive wearable devices in persons with T1D included those related to cardiac autonomic function, cardiorespiratory control balance and fitness, sudomotor function, and skin temperature. Cardiac autonomic function measures, particularly the indices of heart rate and heart rate variability, have been shown to be valuable in diagnosing and monitoring cardiac autonomic neuropathy and, potentially, predicting and detecting hypoglycemia. All identified physiological parameters were shown to be associated with some aspects of diabetes complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, as well as macrovascular disease, with capacity for early risk prediction. However, although they can be monitored by available wearable sensors, most studies have yet to adopt them, as opposed to using more conventional devices. Conclusions Wearable sensors have the potential to augment T1D sensing with additional, informative biomarkers, which can be monitored noninvasively, seamlessly, and continuously. However, significant challenges associated with measurement accuracy, removal of noise and motion artifacts, and smart decision-making exist. Consequently, research should focus on harvesting the information hidden in the complex data generated by wearable sensors and on developing models and smart decision strategies to optimize the incorporation of these novel inputs into T1D interventions.","originating from medical devices. 2. The relationship between the parameters monitored with wearables and glucose regulation is complex. 3. The strict safety constraints in the management of T1D impose hard boundaries on the testing and validation of new decision tools. Benefits and Future Directions:
 Despite the hurdles, this survey makes the case that wearable sensors have a significant potential to enhance the life of those living with T1D. The identified links between physiological parameters that wearables can monitor and T1D can be used to augment the T1D sensing space and develop better management tools. The continuous monitoring potential and the abundance of generated data per person can assist in the personalization of interventions. At the same time, wearable sensors that provide seamless and noninvasive monitoring are expected to add a minimum sensing burden compared with other types of sensors, whereas the automation of management processes that today require the cognitive effort of the persons living with T1D (eg, insulin bolus calculation) or induce stress (eg, fear of hypoglycemia) is expected to lead to better quality of life and lower daily burden. Benefits and Future Directions:
 To harvest this potential, 2 main directions for future research can be identified. First, advanced data processing strategies need to be developed to extract the information obtained from the data collected through wearable sensors. This research direction is not specific to T1D, and T1D can profit from the research outcomes of every field (health care or other), which opts to use wearable sensors. Second, further simulations, models, and clinical studies need to be conducted to support the development of decision tools for T1D based on the data collected through wearables. This direction is T1D-specific and involves multidisciplinary collaboration among data scientists, engineers, clinicians in the field, and persons with lived experience of T1D. Comparison With Previous Work:
 This survey aims to bridge on one side the large volume of research dedicated to identifying correlations between T1D glycemic control and complications with measurable physiological functions and on the other side, the novel potential of wearable technology in medical applications. The bulk of existing work dedicated to wearable technology and T1D is related to glucose sensing and omits other biomarkers that can be readily and noninvasively monitored with the available wearable sensors. To the authors' knowledge, a survey that explores the potential of wearable sensors in T1D has not been conducted till date. This is the first attempt to bring the fields of T1D and wearables together to highlight the potential of these sensors in the daily management of this disease and the mitigation of its long-term complications. Survey Limitations:
 The main limitation of the survey was that the search was conducted based on a list of wearable-enabled biomarkers (Textbox 1), which may not be exhaustive. Additional knowledge models related to wearables and T1D may exist that were not identified. Moreover, the focus was only on noninvasive sensors and did not consider minimally invasive wearable technology, which can be another pathway to further enhance T1D diagnosis and management. Similarly, the survey focused only on wearable sensors and did not discuss noninvasive, nonwearable devices, such as breath or saliva sensors, which can also be highly advantageous in T1D (eg, breath acetone sensing)."

","for all patients, regardless of their socioeconomic status. While there have been significant advancements in RPM technology in recent years, many patients, particularly those living in rural or underserved areas, may not have access to these tools due to cost or limited availability. AI in diabetes and Glycemic control:
 Artificial intelligence is a fast-growing field with its applications for persons living with many chronic diseases such as diabetes. There has been global concern about the ever-increasing incidence rate of diabetes with one in two persons undiagnosed and untreated . The total number of people living with diabetes is likely to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045 . A recent study of 300,000 patients with type 2 diabetes on medical therapy found that after 3 months, 31% of patients had discontinued their diabetes medications that number was widened to 44% by 6 months, and to 58% by 1 year . Besides, about 75% of diabetic adults live in lowand middle-income countries with only 5% of those receiving thorough treatment according to guidelines . The best care for diabetes is mostly hindered by lack of real-time crucial health information required to make necessary choices with diabetes control and therapy. AI in diabetes and Glycemic control:
 Today, advances in AI have introduced a shift in diabetes care from conventional management approaches to targeted data-driven precision care. There is a spectrum of interventions spread across different care processes in diabetes. AI is not only being applied to predict diabetes risk utilizing genetic data and to diagnose diabetes via electronic health record data in clinical decision support but it is also transforming diabetic care and predicting the potential sequelae of diabetes such as nephropathy and retinopathy. Such solutions have enhanced the workflow of both medical staff and patients. How is AI utilized in diabetic care?:
 To help fight diabetes disease and improve its management, AI can play a vital role in diabetic care at many different levels discussed below that can benefit both providers and patients in a team-oriented approach. Diabetes prediction:
 AI can help diagnose diabetes noninvasively and proactively by identifying a subset of populations with the highest risks at a pre-illness stage. Though diabetes prediction models have been generated by conventional statistics, machine learning (ML) can maximize the predictive performance of conventional models to the next level . Algorithms built by ML can do risk stratification by analyzing genomics, lifestyles, mental and physical health, and social media activity. Earlier detection and intervention for at-risk individuals could decrease the incidence of diabetes, and the financial costs associated with uncontrolled diabetes. Lifestyle guidance for diabetes patients:
 Monitoring glucose levels in real-time is being done using wearable devices and continuous glucose monitoring systems of patient symptoms and biomarkers. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM), which are now frequently used by diabetics, acquire a large amount of data that has previously been underutilized. The amount of glucose in the fluid inside the body is measured by CGM. In certain circumstances, the sensor is glued to the back of the arm or is implanted under the skin of the belly rapidly and painlessly. The information is then sent to a wireless-pager-like monitor through a transmitter on the sensor ."

Fortunately, with the help of IoMT, monitoring diabetic patients remotly is becoming more doable . However, the management of diabetes using continous glucose monitoring techniques is still a challenging process . Figure  shows the IoMT based contionus glucose monitoring. Figure 3. IoMT based contionus glucose monitoring:
 The main contribution of the proposed study is to enhance the healthcare living facilities using IoMT for RHM of diabetic patients. Patients with diabetes need 24/7 monitoring  which can be achived by measuring the blood glucose (BG) level using wearable sensors . RELATED WORKS:
 In order to address IoMT related challenges, several studies have been conducted in IoMTbased remote health monitoring for diabetic patients. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IoMT BASED RHM:
 RHM based on IoT can make a healthcare easier and more efficient in terms of cost, accessibility, visibility, reliability, accuracy, affordability, continuity, and real time monitoring. For example, hospitalized patients cost a huge money on the patients, healthcare centers, and insurance companies. Moreover, patients living in remote areas do not have an easy access to the hospitals and caregiver centers. Thus, they need to travel for long distances to seek health care. IoT in RHM has the ability of interoperability, communication and information exchange, and data transfer that improve healthcare services. In addition, RHM provides a continues monitoring for chronic diseases (i.e. diabetes) . Table  shows the advantages and benefits of RHM based IoMT for patients, caregivers and insurance companies . CHALLENGES AND FUTURE TRENDS:
 This section summarizes the challenges of the remote health monitoring of the diabetic patients through wearable sensors . This include: 1) Cost effective and non-obstructive sensing devices : design and evaluate a non-obstructive sensing devices with low cost is a challenging issue. 2) Data processing  and big data problem : big data originate from sensing devises in a short time is hard to store and manage if the access to cloud is unavailable. 3) Security and privacy : medical sensor data and electronic patient records are very critical and sensitive. However, it is crucial to protect these data from potential internet threats. 4) Uncontrolled environment  and Noise intrfere : various noise levels may occure. 5) Wireless technology : No connectivity and wireless technology standards for IoT. 6) Reliability and availability : several connected devices, software, services, and users are connected which leads to increase the failure rate. 7) Energy efficiency : real time continuous sensing consumes the power. 8) Intelligent algorithms used for data processing require sufficient and big training data."

Massive improvements in image processing and computer hardware have allowed the emergence of multiple imaging techniques of the eye that can transform patient care. The purpose of this review is to describe the most recent advances in eye imaging and explain how new technologies and imaging methods can be utilized in a clinical setting. The introduction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) was a revolution in eye imaging and has since become the standard of care for a plethora of conditions. Its most recent iterations, OCT angiography, and visible light OCT, as well as imaging modalities, such as fluorescent lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, would allow a more thorough evaluation of patients and provide additional information on disease processes. Toward that goal, the application of adaptive optics (AO) and full-field scanning to a variety of eye imaging techniques has further allowed the histologic study of single cells in the retina and anterior segment. Toward the goal of remote eye care and more accessible eye imaging, methods such as handheld OCT devices and imaging through smartphones, have emerged. Finally, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in eye images has the potential to become a new milestone for eye imaging while also contributing in social aspects of eye care.","Retinopathy: Using AI in the setting of DR is one of the most promising applications in medicine. As opposed to general monitoring of diabetes, which can be performed easily (blood glucose testing, HbA1c levels and others), DR requires qualitative evaluation. Artificial Intelligence and Diabetic Retinopathy:
 The modalities more commonly used for diagnosis and monitoring of DR are fundus pictures, OCT, and OCT-A scans (as mentioned above). AI has the potential to detect disease in early (even asymptomatic) stages, classify it, predict the disease course, and thus guide treatment in select eyes . Tools can match or even outperform physicians and can make access to screening broader and less expensive; algorithms and devices are already clinically available (IDx-DR by Digital Diagnostics, Coralville, IA, United States; SELENA+ by EyRIS, Singapore) and have been authorized for use in multiple fundus cameras . Training models for AI has been steadily increasing for diagnosing DR from fundus pictures, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity improving over time (reaching 95.7, 97.5, and 98%, respectively) . Artificial Intelligence and Diabetic Retinopathy:
 Similar results are also seen when using CNNs for DR severity grading; Ryu et al. have recently developed a fully automated algorithm to classify DR stages with accuracy of 91-98%, sensitivity of 86-97%, and specificity of 94-99% . Application of these models can also establish biomarkers useful for diagnosis and treatment response; these could be structural (retinal layer measurement, hyperreflective foci) or vascular (areas of non-perfusion, vascular leakage, microaneurysm count, and neovascularization) . TELEOPHTHALMOLOGY AND SMARTPHONE FUNDUS IMAGING:
 Telemedicine is defined as ""the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates the participants"" . In response to its growing demand in recent years, further enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic, ophthalmologists have begun to implement techniques and technologies more widely to better facilitate patient care in a remote setting. This would make access to eye care more accessible, easier and more convenient for patients, faster, and more cost-effective. In terms of ophthalmic care, teleophthalmology is mostly applicable to ophthalmic emergencies, screening, and monitoring of chronic conditions. TELEOPHTHALMOLOGY AND SMARTPHONE FUNDUS IMAGING:
 One such technique is imaging of the eye with a smartphone (smartphone imaging -SI). The use of smartphones for clinical imaging in ophthalmology was first introduced by Lord et al. in 2010 . It was demonstrated that an iPhone could be used to capture external photos of the orbit and surrounding structures, indirectly image the anterior segment and the fundus of the eye when used with a slit lamp fitted with a 78D lens or a handheld 20D lens ."

It may cause many complications, precisely when a patient moves, which may risk their and other drivers’ and pedestrians’ lives. Recent research shows diabetic drivers are the main cause of major road accidents. Several wireless non-invasive health monitoring sensors, such as wearable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors, in combination with machine learning approaches at cloud servers, can be beneficial for monitoring drivers’ diabetic conditions on travel to reduce the accident rate.

 Diabetes is a chronic disorder that prompts long-term complications and other disorders. Finding the disease at the beginning phases diminishes clinical expenses and the risk of patients having more confounded medical conditions. Researchers have made fruitful accomplishments in the field of diabetes prediction and treatment. Abundant, helpful, and indicative information is required for further comprehensive research by utilizing data mining (DM) and ML later. This segment gives a summed-up survey of all the recently proposed diabetes prediction and monitoring approaches. Related Work:
 Kavakiotis I. et al.  provide a precise survey of data mining, ML strategies, and instruments in the field of diabetes research concerning: Diabetic complications, prediction and diagnosis, genetic background, environmental risk factors, and health care and management. A broad series of ML algorithms were utilized. A total of 15% of those was portrayed by unsupervised learning techniques and 85% by supervised ones, and all the more explicitly, association rules. Concerning the kind of information, clinical datasets were utilized. Rghioui A. et al.  proposed an intelligent architecture for monitoring diabetic patients using machine learning algorithms. The architecture elements included smart devices, sensors, and smartphones to collect measurements from the body. Naive Bayes, SVM, random forest, and simple classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were used. As evaluation parameters, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision were used, and they achieved accuracy (average of 70.08). Chen M. et al.  proposed a 5G-smart diabetes framework, which consolidates recent technologies, such as big data, ML, and wearable 2.0, to create a comprehensive examination and detection for patients experiencing diabetes. This can be achieved by assembling a 5G-smart diabetes testbed with cell phones, a huge data cloud, and smart clothing. Three machine learning calculations, SVM, DT, and ANN, are actualized to build various models for finding a cure for diabetes. Related Work:
 However, Noshadi H. et al.  present a substitute technique for gathering diabetic patients' pre-recorded physiological information utilizing VANET. The vehicles gather synthetic, noise, and traffic tests and can straightforwardly correspond with the subject's anxiety. The correspondence between the patient and the vehicle was started. At the same time, the on-body sensor receives the message from the vehicle's GPS information and IP address. The system was liable for data assortment, beginning the communication among vehicles and wearable devices and affirming content delivery. Songer, T. J. et al.  highlight a higher involvement of drivers with diabetes in vehicle road accidents. According to this report, vehicle crash risk remained higher for drivers with diabetes throughout the age span. The finding of this report indicates that the risk of vehicle crashes is 30% higher in diabetic patients than in the non-diabetic population."

Regular eye screening is imperative to detect sight-threatening stages of diabetic retinopathy such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema in order to treat these before irreversible visual loss occurs. Screening is cost-effective and has been implemented in various countries in Europe and elsewhere. Along with optimised diabetes care, this has substantially reduced the risk of visual loss. Nevertheless, the growing number of patients with diabetes poses an increasing burden on healthcare systems and automated solutions are needed to alleviate the task of screening and improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning by convolutional neural networks is an optimised branch of artificial intelligence that is particularly well suited to automated image analysis. Pivotal studies have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for classifying advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy and identifying diabetic macular oedema in optical coherence tomography scans. Based on this, different algorithms have obtained regulatory approval for clinical use and have recently been implemented to some extent in a few countries. Handheld mobile devices are another promising option for self-monitoring, but so far they have not demonstrated comparable image quality to that of fundus photography using non-portable retinal cameras, which is the gold standard for diabetic retinopathy screening. Such technology has the potential to be integrated in telemedicine-based screening programmes, enabling self-captured retinal images to be transferred virtually to reading centres for analysis and planning of further steps. While emerging technologies have shown a lot of promise, clinical implementation has been sparse. Legal obstacles and difficulties in software integration may partly explain this, but it may also indicate that existing algorithms may not necessarily integrate well with national screening initiatives, which often differ substantially between countries.

Diabetes is caused by an excess of sugar collected in the blood. Diabetes is one of the most serious chronic health issues. Diabetes sufferers' eyes, hearts, kidneys, and nerves may be damaged if they go undiagnosed. Humans can benefit from automated technologies to assist them in managing their hectic schedules. It inspires us to create a diabetes management scheme for patients that uses an IoT device to track their blood sugar, blood pressure, sports activities, nutrition plan, oxygen level, and ECG data. Machine learning has risen to prominence in healthcare services (HCS) due to its potential to enhance disease prediction. AI and ML approaches have already been used in the HCS field. We give a complete review of DL applications in diabetes in this study. We did a thorough literature review as well as discovered three key areas where this method is used: diabetes diagnosis, glucose control, and diabetes-related complication diagnosis. The search yielded 40 original research articles, from which we summarised essential data on used learning methods, development methods, main outcomes, and performance evaluation baseline techniques. According to the Reviewed Literature, various DL techniques and frameworks attained state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional ML methods.","a Google team has made significant progress. In a human-centred study, they used deep learning to treat diabetic eye problems at 11 clinics. The findings suggest several socio-environmental issues must be addressed before such automated systems can be widely deployed. Conclusion and future scope::
 The adoption of Big Data Analytics in Hadoop provides a systematic means to achieve improved outcomes, such as the availability and cost of healthcare services for all populations. NCDs such as diabetes is a major health concern in India. This study will help diabetes patients comprehend difficulties that may emerge by converting diverse health records into relevant analysed results. This paper provides a complete overview of the current trend in DL methods for diabetes research.

The early identification and effective management of diabetes are crucial for controlling its spread. Currently, the HbA1c test is the gold standard for the detection of diabetes with high confidence. But this is an invasive, expensive pathology test. Therefore, alternative non-invasive and inexpensive methods have been proposed in the literature for the early detection of diabetes. In this pilot study, we used a handheld fundus camera that simplifies the accessibility issue for doctors and patients in underprivileged communities, remote areas, enabling a quick and reasonably accurate diabetes diagnosis process. We invited participants from the community to share their demographic information, history of diabetes, and captured their retinal fundus images using the oDocs Nun IR handheld non-mydriatic fundus camera in a non-invasive manner (no dilation is required). Subsequently, we developed a deep learning model for early diagnosis of diabetes based on fundus image only. Moreover, we created an Android-based mobile application, DMPred, which utilizes the fundus images to predict the onset of diabetes. The proposed model achieved an 86.4% accuracy rate in diabetes detection showing that handheld cameras can be effective and provide comparable results like tabletop cameras in the early diagnosis of diabetes. We also provide a comprehensive guideline, including necessary steps for transforming deep learning models into Android-based mobile applications for tech transfer. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first demonstration of diabetes diagnosis using handheld fundus camera and mobile app. We believe that this pilot study and the proposed tech solution will support the larger community with limited clinical facilities and enhance the accessibility of technology for diabetes detection. In this paper, we presented a pilot study by developing a deep learning model for diabetes diagnosis based on images acquired using a handheld fundus camera from oDocs. This model achieved high accuracy and this model was integrated with an Android based mobile “DMPred”.

Introduction: These traditional fundus cameras are often bulky and immobile, limiting their use in remote or point-of-care settings where portability and ease of use are essential. Introduction:
 However, advancements in retinal imaging technologies, such as handheld fundus cameras and portable devices, aim to address this shortcoming by enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of retinal imaging for various healthcare settings such as remote areas, underprivileged communities or limited/difficult access to healthcare facilities such as during the time of COVID-19 . Introduction:
 Handheld fundus camers such as those produced by oDocs , Remidio  Volk Optical , are non-mydriatic and use smartphone devices with special mobile applications to capture fundus images. AI's capabilities in in medical imaging and diagnosis have benefited from recent advancements in deep learning, particularly, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). Introduction:
 Enhanced CNN models have improved performance and therefore enabled more reliable disease diagnosis such as diabetes detection using retinal images. Combined with the advancements in handheld retinal cameras, these innovations support further progress in diabetes detection in a more salable healthcare setting. Introduction:
 The integration of AI models into mobile apps for the automatic diagnosis of diabetes using fundus images show great promise in improving the accessibility and efficiency of DR screening. These AI-powered mobile apps leverage deep learning algorithms to analyze retinal fundus images captured using smartphone cameras or compatible attachments. Introduction:
 By applying computer vision techniques, these apps can detect and classify DR related abnormalities, helping in the early detection and diagnosis of diabetic-related eye diseases. Rajalakshmi et al.  Used fundus images captured with a smartphone to assess the effectiveness of AI-based automated software in identifying DR and sight-threatening DR (STDR). Introduction:
 The software demonstrated high sensitivity (95.8% for any DR, 99.1% for STDR) and reasonable specificity (80.2% for any DR, 80.4% for STDR) in detecting both DR and STDR. Introduction:
 The findings imply that automated AI analysis of retinal images from smartphones may be a useful tool for screening people with diabetes for retinal abnormalities on a large scale. Introduction:
 Another study by Sosale et al  evaluated the Medios AI algorithm's performance in diagnosing DR using nonmydriatic retinal images captured by one of the handheld devices produced by . The algorithm demonstrated 83.3% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity for detecting referable DR, showing promise for accurate diagnosis using non-mydriatic Baseline characteristics of the participants:
 Based on our invitation to participants, we conducted the data collection over two days. During this period, 22 participants visited the data collection centre. The number of diabetic participants was 8/22 (36.4%) and non-diabetic participants were 14/22 (63.6%). Baseline characteristics of the participants:
 Of the the total number of participants, 15/22 were male (68.2%) and 7/22 were female (31.8%). The average age of the diabetic group was 42.8 years and for the non-diabetic group 35.9 years. The average BMI among participants was 27.53 ± 4.49."

Methods This study investigated the performance, feasibility, and user experience of a seamless hardware and software solution for screening chronic eye diseases in a real-world clinical environment in Germany. The solution integrated AI grading for DR, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma, along with specialist auditing and patient referral decision. The study comprised several components: (1) evaluating the entire system solution from recruitment to eye image capture and AI grading for DR, AMD, and glaucoma; (2) comparing specialist’s grading results with AI grading results; (3) gathering user feedback on the solution. Results A total of 231 patients were recruited, and their consent forms were obtained. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve for DR grading were 100.00%, 80.10%, and 90.00%, respectively. For AMD grading, the values were 90.91%, 78.79%, and 85.00%, and for glaucoma grading, the values were 93.26%, 76.76%, and 85.00%. The analysis of all false positive cases across the three diseases and their comparison with the final referral decisions revealed that only 17 patients were falsely referred among the 231 patients. The efficacy analysis of the system demonstrated the effectiveness of the AI grading process in the study’s testing environment. Clinical staff involved in using the system provided positive feedback on the disease screening process, particularly praising the seamless workflow from patient registration to image transmission and obtaining the final result. Results from a questionnaire completed by 12 participants indicated that most found the system easy, quick, and highly satisfactory. The study also revealed room for improvement in the AMD model, suggesting the need to enhance its training data. Furthermore, the performance of the glaucoma model grading could be improved by incorporating additional measures such as intraocular pressure. Conclusions The implementation of the AI-based approach for screening three chronic eye diseases proved effective in real-world settings, earning positive feedback on the usability of the integrated platform from both the screening staff and auditors. The auditing function has proven valuable for obtaining efficient second opinions from experts, pointing to its potential for enhancing remote screening capabilities.

 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic diseases involving severe insulin deficiency with usually acute onset of hyperglycemia due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, or gradual onset of hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance . Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of DM, and the main cause of blindness in working-age adults, which can be retarded, palliated, or even avoided if detected early. Unfortunately, most patients who develop this condition are asymptomatic until late stages, when treatment is less effective or DR is irreversible. Classically, screening procedures for DR are usually based on imaging techniques of the fundus of the eye. The analysis of such images has been optimized during the last years by machine learning (ML) methods, capable of detecting even microaneurysms-the earliest visible sign of retinal damage . The relatively recent application of user-friendly and reasonably affordable smartphones for the implementation of computer-assisted approaches has permitted the exportation of Sensors 2022, 22, 718 2 of 18 such screening imaging-based methods to developing countries, where lack of funds and personnel have often been the limiting factors to their healthcare systems . Many recent reviews have already extensively explored the possibilities of computer-assisted methods for screening DM and DR , which still present few actual applications in the form of commercially available products . Less (but commendable) attention is paid to alternative and early DR detection techniques, such as electrochemical  or colorimetric . These methods usually rely upon the detection of a biomarker (or multiple biomarkers simultaneously) which might indicate the presence of the target disease (potentially earlier than the image-based methods, which usually rely upon observation of already-damaged tissues) . The higher reliability of these multi-targeted sensing approaches can even be improved by the use of technologies with multiple and diversely integrated sensors, for which the great amount of data can be efficiently filtered and processed by ML. In this review, we present a series of colorimetric (with special emphasis on naked-eye approaches) and electrochemical techniques for the non-invasive detection and/or quantification of DM biomarkers, including sensor arrays powered or not by ML models . The scope is to encourage the reader towards development of ML-powered sensor arrays for early diagnosis of DM and DR."

Recent developments in diagnostic technologies facilitated studies on retinal conditions and ocular disease in metabolism and endocrinology. Globally, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is regarded as a major cause of vision loss. Deep learning systems are effective and accurate in the detection of DR from digital fundus photographs or optical coherence tomography. Thus, using AI techniques, systems with high accuracy and efficiency can be developed for diagnosing and screening DR at an early stage and without the resources that are only accessible in special clinics. Deep learning enables early diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity, which makes decisions based on minimally handcrafted features paving the way for personalized DR progression real-time monitoring and in-time ophthalmic or endocrine therapies. This review will discuss cutting-edge AI algorithms, the automated detecting systems of DR stage grading and feature segmentation, the prediction of DR outcomes and therapeutics, and the ophthalmic indications of other systemic diseases revealed by AI.","to ophthalmic clinic still faces some problems in reality. Although there are many representative international datasets of DR available to build the diagnosis model, they were designed with insufficient consideration for clinical adaptability. The data quality was uneven and the labeling standards varied. Conclusion:
 Therefore, a standardized dataset with a large sample size needs to be constructed with authoritative and recognized high-quality annotations, which is prerequisite to improve the performance of AI systems finally. In addition, the regulatory mechanism and evaluation criteria have not yet formed a complete and unified system. It is also necessary to establish and improve an AI product evaluation system that conforms to medical evaluation standards before the large-scale clinical use of AI, in order to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Conclusion:
 Since DR has seen the first FDA clearance named IDx-DR for an autonomous AI diagnostic system without an image interpretation provided by a specialist, more and more commercial products are developed and believed to come into the market in the near future. In China, training and validation data for AI algorithms are vast due to a rather centralized healthcare system and the largest population of DR (93). Hundreds of new start-up companies working on AI applications to healthcare in China have emerged to improve business, and several DR AI-based screening tools have acquired the certificate of medical device Class III approved by NMPA as pioneers, e.g., Silicon Intelligence, Airdoc, Vistel, and especially Intelligent Healthcare of Baidu that developed the first granted algorithm working robustly with various fundus camera models and achieving high accuracies for detecting multiple ophthalmic diseases . Undoubtedly, the real-world deployment of these new systems in multiple settings will be full of challenges not only in AI diagnostic technologies but also in the marketing pattern and policy-making. The combination of telemedicine aided by 5G technology and automated retinal image analysis will enhance the convenience of DR care by  Scheme of the AI-based applications integrating DR screening with multimodal features. Fundus image inputs, including digital fundus photography and OCT, integrated with multimodal features, are indicative for diverse systemic diseases such as diabetes, nephropathy, cognitive disorder, and cerebro-or cardiovascular disease, facilitating the four perspectives of medical practice concerned. Conclusion:
 providing automated real-time assessment in a more personalized way, supporting commercial interests to promote the whole industry. Additionally, multicenter, head-to-head, real-world validation, multimodality, and improved algorithm studies are imperative and encouraged to conduct, which might magnify the significance of DR screening beyond preventing sight-threatening diseases to the new strategies of systemic diagnosis in metabolism and endocrinology."

 Diabetes mellitus or diabetes is considered as a collection of metabolic conditions that can predominantly be described by hyperglycemia rising from the deficiency in insulin discharge . The prolonged hyperglycemia of diabetes is correlated with long-term impairment and collapse of heart, kidneys, and microvascular circulation of the retina . Among the diabetic individuals in the USA, almost 30% of them have the tendency of growing diabetic retinopathy (DR), a common complication for diabetic patients which may lead to blindness , .

Alternatively, these retinal images could be used to detect diabetes as well, but it requires subjective judgement from the ophthalmologist, and it might be time consuming as well. The human oriented subjective judgement could be avoided if we could implement the automation of retinal image-based diabetes diagnosis in clinical setup. Such automation could alleviate the workload of the ophthalmologist as well as screen a large number of patients objectively within a short amount of time . Though there are multiple studies ,  that aim at detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, none addressed the task of detecting diabetes using retinal images from a holistic point of view. In fact, a significant number of studies focused on the diagnosis of diabetes mainly based on clinical markers e.g., HbA1c, Glucose .

Methods: Evaluation of the software was performed on a dataset of 7195 nonmydriatic fundus images from 6325 eyes of 3189 diabetic patients attending our screening program between February to December of 2019. The software generated a DR severity score for each colour fundus image which was combined into an eye-level score. This score was then compared with a reference standard as set by a human expert using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The artificial intelligence (AI) software achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.988 [0.981:0.993] for the detection of referable DR. At the proposed operating point, the sensitivity of the RetCAD software for DR is 90.53% and specificity is 97.13%. A workload reduction of 96% could be achieved at the cost of only 6 false negatives.

 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health problem with a significant clinical impact on our society . Sedentary lifestyles, obesity and lack of awareness are several potential factors that have contributed to an increased prevalence of DM, particularly in developing countries . Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of DM and is a leading cause of acquired visual loss and blindness among the working-age population . Introduction:
 Early detection of this condition is critical to reach better outcomes, because DR may remain asymptomatic until it progresses to an advanced vision-threatening stage. For this reason, DR screening programs have long been recommended for patients with diabetes, adopting regular follow-ups, in order to detect the onset or progression of DR condition . Telemedicine-based screening for DR using digital nonmydriatic fundus photography has proven to be effective for detection of DR along with an appropriate referral . This method makes screening available to more patients and it can be used as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative than conventional in-office examination by an ophthalmologist . Introduction:
 As the prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise in the future, together with the aging of populations globally, an associated increase in DR cases should also be expected . In parallel, there is a need of intensify screening programs to include larger number of patients. So, in an effort to develop long-term strategies to manage this increasing burden of diabetes patients and possible retinopathy cases, artificial intelligence (AI) appears as an innovative tool of optimizing screening programs. DR screening programs require human grader evaluation of the images which is resourceconsuming, while deep learning approaches are gaining popularity in automated detection of DR from retinal fundus photographs as they have achieved excellent diagnostic performance in terms of high sensitivity and specificity . Introduction:
 In an attempt to increase the efficiency of DR screening and optimizing daily work flow, we designed this study to determine the performance of a deep learning system in detecting referable DR images from a real setting screening program compared with the evaluation done by ophthalmologist human graders. Our aim is to evaluate the amount of workload that could be released with this AI-based technology while keeping a suitable safety profile. Participants and images:
 A dataset of deidentified digital nonmydriatic fundus images were collected from consecutive recruited patients with a diagnosis of either type 1 or 2 DM who attended their regular visit at Ramon y Cajal Hospitals screening program. Fundus photographs were taken by trained nurses during routine clinical practice between February to December of 2019. Captures were done with a Topcon TRC-NW400 fundus camera (Topcon Medical Systems, Inc) using a 45º field of view. No mydriasis was applied. The acquisition protocol ensured that at least one fovea centered image per eye had to be taken. In total 7454 images of 3270 patients were collected. The mean age of the patients was 64.7 years (range 14-92 years) and 54% were male. The mean duration of their diabetes was 6.7 years (range 1-48 years) and 85% had type 2 DM."

Healthcare data are being produced at ever-increasing rates, and this information has the potential to transform the provision of diabetes care. Big Data is beginning to have an impact on diabetes care through data research. The use of Big Data for routine clinical care is still a future application. Vast amounts of healthcare data are already being produced, and the key is harnessing these to produce actionable insights. Considerable development work is required to achieve these goals.","will be available easily and in a readily absorbed format. Pills with chips inside will be able to signal when the person has taken their medication . Improved categorisation of those at risk of Type 2 diabetes would lead to better and more targeted preventative measures . Big Data: the future:
 Artificial intelligence will power apps that provide individualized guidance for people with diabetes e.g. adjustments of their treatment regimen and dietary recommendations. Big Data: the future:
 Monitoring of blood glucose alone does not improve and can have negative effects . The data gathered from apps will improve the algorithms used for predictions and dose calculations. Bluetooth-enabled injection devices could automatically dispense the correct amount of insulin. Insulin pumps and automated insulin delivery systems can be controlled by software with or without the intervention of healthcare professionals. Connected glucose monitors could alert healthcare professionals if the person becomes hypoglycaemic. Artificial intelligence could identify what the cause of poor glycaemic control is for individuals. Wearable devices that monitor food consumption e.g. by serial photographs of food will be able to advise the person on what adjustments to make to their medications, and what effect that item likely to have on their metabolic profile . Systems for the automated analysis of retinal images will take over the routine task of monitoring retinopathy. Big Data: the future:
 The increasing use of real world data will ensure that the evidence applies to the patient group in question. Factors peculiar to a particular ethnic group, locality or institution will be rapidly detected. This will enable the benefits of research to apply to the entire patient population and will particularly benefit ethnic minorities whose relevant genetic characteristics or other factors may differ from the general population. Conclusions:
 Diabetes is an appealing target for Big Data research for a number of reasons, not least because it has a substantial impact on population health that is likely to increase significantly over the next few decades. It is a complex, polygenic disorder that is comprised of a number of different subtypes. A number of serious complications can occur, and these can all be ameliorated by intensive management of blood glucose and other risk factors. Conclusions:
 The overall economic impact of T2DM is huge, once costs of diabetes management, treatment of complications, and indirect economic costs, such as lost productivity, are included. This means that there is great potential for both new drug discoveries and large cost savings. The study of prediabetes holds the promise of reducing the incidence of diabetes, either through public health measures or more targeted intervention measures. Conclusions:
 A large amount of healthcare data can be (and ought to be) generated by people with diabetes. This ought to be exploited to the maximum extent to develop new insights. It is the responsibility of the research community to maximise the benefits. This will require the correct approach to data stewardship to ensure ongoing trust.

Method The study included 491 ultra-wide-field fundus ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images that passed an image-quality review and were graded as no apparent DR (NDR; 169 images), mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR; 76 images), moderate NPDR (54 images), severe NPDR (90 images), and proliferative DR (PDR; 102 images) by three retinal experts by the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale. The findings of tests 1 and 2 to identify no apparent diabetic retinopathy (NDR) and PDR, respectively, were then assessed. For each verification, Optos, OCTA, and Optos OCTA imaging scans with DCNN were performed. Result The Optos, OCTA, and Optos OCTA imaging test results for comparison between NDR and DR showed mean areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, 0.883, and 0.847; sensitivity rates of 80.9%, 83.9%, and 78.6%; and specificity rates of 55%, 71.6%, and 69.8%, respectively.

Conclusion The combination of Optos and OCTA imaging with DCNN could detect DR at desirable levels of accuracy and may be useful in clinical practice and retinal screening. Although the combination of multiple imaging techniques might overcome their individual weaknesses and provide comprehensive imaging, artificial intelligence in classifying multimodal images has not always produced accurate results.","in ETDRS 7 are considered predominantly peripheral lesions, the extent of which is associated with retinopathy progression . Furthermore, this cohort included eyes treated with and eyes treated without a pan retinal photocoagulation (PRP) laser. Discussion:
 Progress in traditional technologies, such as digital fundus photography, along with recent advancements in various imaging modalities, has provided clinicians with new information and improved efficiency. Tran and Pakzad-Vaezi reported the benefits of multimodal imaging of DR and the clinical applications of several imaging techniques in DR including color photography, OCT, OCTA, and adaptive optics . Discussion:
 Furthermore, the use of the combination of DCNN and these multimodal images in diagnosing DR is expected to increase in the future, and the use of DCNN in the analysis of retinal images is appealing given its suitability with the current trend of teleophthalmology and telemedicine , and cost-effectiveness . Considering that an automated DR grading software can potentially offer better efficiency, reproducibility, and early detection of DR, the use of this grading software in the screening of the even-increasing number of individuals with diabetes should help reduce the    healthcare burden. Discussion:
 e use of multimodal images with DCNN would enable screening for referable DR in remote areas where services of an ophthalmologist are unavailable. However, understanding the indications and limitations of each technology allows clinicians to gain the most information from each modality and thereby optimize patient care. In an actual human clinical setting, the combination of multiple imaging techniques can overcome their individual weaknesses and provide a more comprehensive representation. Such an approach helps in the accurate localization of a lesion and understanding the pathology in posterior segment. Considering that the major technological advancements in imaging over the past decade have improved our understanding and knowledge regarding DR, a multimodal approach to imaging has become the standard of care . However, the present study revealed that multimodal diagnosis using AI did not always yield the best results. Discussion:
 e present study has several limitations. One of the major issues of this study is the small number of images for training. Many DL researchers agree that such a small number of data in each category is insufficient to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Deep learning generally requires more than a million samples to train without  overfitting. Another limitation is that this cohort included eyes treated with and eyes treated without a PRP laser, which may have confounded our results. Discussion:
 In summary, our study suggests that the use of AI in classifying multimodal images did not always produce accurate results and showed advantages and disadvantages depending on the stage. Although combination of DCNN and multimodal images certainly provides better result, it is not particularly superior to medical examination. Face-toface examinations by ophthalmologists are indispensable for a definite diagnosis. Conclusions:
 Although UWF fundus ophthalmoscopy and OCTA images with a DCNN were effective in diagnosing DR, the use of AI in diagnosing multimodal images did not always produce accurate results. Acknowledgments:

 Diabetic retinopathy is a major public health problem and the leading cause of vision loss in the working age population. DR occurs when the blood vessels in the retina are damaged due to high blood sugar. These damaged blood vessels can cause blurry vision or stop the blood flow. Advanced DR causes vision loss. DR usually affects both eyes . In 2015, worldwide, around 415 million people have diabetes . This number is expected to reach 642 million by 2040 . As this number increases, so too will the number of DR cases. Records show that early detection and diagnosis can lead to the protection of eyesight. Noninvasive medical image modalities have been used to detect and diagnose DR. The most popular image modalities for the detection and diagnosis of DR are fundus imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Visual diagnosis using these modalities is subjective and time consuming. Therefore, automated methods  have been presented in the literature for the automated detection and diagnosis of DR. The aim of this paper is to present an automated platform for the detection and diagnosis of DR."

 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness among working-age people, about one-third of the diabetic population have clinically visible DR, another one-third might suffer a sight-threatening state of the disease, characterized as proliferative DR (PDR) or diabetic macular edema (DME) . There is considerable heterogeneity in the incidence of DR around the world and within countries . In China, the prevalence of DR in diabetic patients is 24.7-37.0%, the proportion of referable DR (moderate non-proliferative DR or worse) is around 25% and sight-threatening DR (STDR, severe non-proliferative DR or worse) is about 11%, which were reported to increase rapidly . INTRODUCTION:
 As the early stage of DR is usually asymptomatic, only 36.5% of diabetic patients in China are aware of this disease, even fewer patients could get timely interventions . Numerous DR patients might progress to a late-stage and suffer severe and irreversible visual loss. Thus, early detection and timely referral are of great value in delaying the progress of DR and preventing vision loss. Although advanced fundus cameras and telehealth services were widespread in China, the workload of DR screening was too overwhelming, and the number of experienced ophthalmologists was also scarce. Meanwhile, several studies have shown that certified ophthalmologists screening DR by indirect ophthalmoscopy could only achieve an average sensitivity of 33, 34, or 73% . The huge number of people with diabetes, the shortage of ophthalmologists, and the imbalance of medical resources all present as major obstacles to early detection and timely intervention for DR. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a sound monitoring and follow-up strategy for diabetic patients. INTRODUCTION:
 Deep learning (DL), as a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), has shown a convincing performance in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy by fundus images and peripheral neuropathy in diabetes mellitus utilizing corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). DL-based technology has been applied to retinal vascular segmentation, recognition, and classification of DR lesions, referable DR and diabetic neuropathy detection. Recently, Preston et al. developed an AI-based algorithm to classify peripheral neuropathy utilizing CCM without image segmentation prior to classification, which did not require manual or automated annotation and allowed the utilization of a larger database . Most of the above algorithms use the convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture, which has better performance than other network architectures . At the same time, DL has the advantages of continuous work, no need to rest, and reproducibility, so it does not need to spend a lot of manpower to train doctors. In addition, the application of DL in DR referral is conducive to the discovery of DR patients in remote and poor areas and has the potential to reduce ophthalmologists' workload and improve the efficiency of DR screening programs ."

However, the studies are still at an early stage. The majority of studies have used AI only for diseases diagnosis, and the specific mechanisms linking systemic diseases to ocular images are still unclear. In addition, there are many limitations to the research, such as the number of images, the interpretability of artificial intelligence, rare diseases, and ethical and legal issues.While ocular images-based artificial intelligence is widely used, the relationship between the eye and the whole body should be more clearly elucidated. ","tolerance test is the major tools for diagnosing diabetes. As the gold standard, its accuracy is high, but the invasive and frequent puncture blood collection operations limit its use in widespread screening. Noninvasive and convenient screening methods are needed. Diabetes:
 There is no doubt about the relationship between diabetes and the eyes. Long-term chronic hyperglycemic environment brings oxidative stress, metabolic problems, inflammatory response, and many other disorders to the eye and causes various eye illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract . Diabetes patients' retinal microvasculature has already been changed compared to healthy individuals before they acquired diabetic retinopathy . Thus, the detection of diabetes based on retinal images seems to be well documented. In 2020, retinal fundus photographs were collected and used to construct an AI system to detect hyperglycemia . The accuracy of hyperglycemia detection was 78.7%, while the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.880. However, the researchers selected only 1222 images of Chinese rural residents, and the small number of images may have a significant impact on the predictive efficiency of the model. In 2021, Zhang et al. used an AI system to predict diabetes, and over 100,000 images were used in the construction of the model . A person could be screened for type 2 diabetes using fundus photographs. In addition, combining fundus photographs and patient metadata, they predicted the future incidence of diabetes in patients from the cohort study within 5 years. The use of longitudinal data to predict the future of healthy patients is what makes the work of Zhang et al. unique. In their work, rather than directly predicting the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes in healthy subjects within 5 years, the subjects were divided into three groups of low, medium and high risk by risk score. Zhang et al. used metadata and fundus images to predict the risk group of the test set. In this way, doctors can understand and inform patients of their future risk of developing the disease and take actions such as lifestyle changes to reduce the incidence. However, despite the cleverness of this method, it still has some shortcomings. The risk score used by Zhang et al. is not an internationally accepted standard for predicting the risk of developing diabetes. Therefore, the generalizability of this grouping is to be questioned. In external datasets, the AUC of detecting diabetes were over 0.80, and the AUC of prediction model was 0.824. Also, to increase the scope of application of the AI system, they loaded the system on a smartphone to screen the uploaded retinal images through the cloud service. AI based on mobile devices and cloud can broaden the scope of fundus images for screening, reducing the burden of care and regional disparities in healthcare resources."

Providers must integrate these codes into revenue cycle operations. Training clinical staff (nurses and mid-level providers) to check incoming data from patients and escalate decision making to a physician, as needed, is another important step. Diabetes management:
 Wearable continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and lash glucose monitoring devices (a wearable sensor and smartphone/reader to scan the sensor), including the DEXCOM G5/G6 and the Freestyle Libre Sensor, promise to revolutionize diabetes management. These devices enable tight glycemic control while minimizing hyperand hypoglycemic episodes, which can result in improved HbA1c and ""time in-control"" for patients with both type I and type II diabetes . Patients using approved CGMs can self-adjust insulin doses without con irming results with capillary glucose ( ingerstick) readings . The FDA evaluated data from 2 clinical studies including 324 adults and children in which DEXCOM G6 readings were compared against laboratory measurements of blood glucose, and found no serious adverse events . Several landmark trials have demonstrated the ef icacy of CGM technology in patients requiring multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) , continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) , and in patients with hypoglycemic unawareness . In the future, we expect machine learning and robust arti icial intelligence (AI) will assist with this type of analysis. One emerging example is the ""applied health signals engine"" from Livongo . CGM systems are now being deployed in closed-loop con igurations with CSII; the Medtronic Minimed 670G system approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on the market . Others are likely to soon follow. mHealth technologies will enable providers to partner with patients with diabetes, such as adjusting treatment regimens via the patient's mobile device. AI software can ef iciently evaluate patient-generated health data from mHealth tools, along with lab results (e.g., glucose levels, renal function, HbA1c, and lipid pro iles) and eye exam to continuously monitor patients' progress. Patients needing more intensive intervention can meet with a certi ied diabetes educator or have a scheduled clinic visit. These technologies allow for implementation of population health goals, and makes patient management truly time-and place-independent. Diabetes management:
 Recommendations for practice readiness, similar to those for weight management, include additional emphasis on integrating home glucose monitoring data into sections of the electronic record where clinicians can easily view patients' relevant lab data. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) management:
 This chronic condition consumes signi icant healthcare resources and is associated with repeated ER visits and hospitalizations, and high rates of readmission. In the United States, CHF is one of the Medicare readmission penalty diseases; the average cost of a single hospitalization for a Medicare recipient is $14,631, with a median length-of-stay of ive days . Data demonstrate that 40.2% of Medicare patients with CHF are readmitted within 90 days of a prior hospital discharge ."

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified three main areas that use this approach: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications. The search resulted in the selection of 40 original research articles, of which we have summarized the key information about the employed learning models, development process, main outcomes, and baseline methods for performance evaluation. Among the analyzed literature, it is to be noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches.

In order to deploy deep learning in an ambulatory setting, the frameworks mentioned in Section II can be easily ported to mobile devices by using tools such as TensorFlow Lite , . B. Opportunities and Future Work:
 To interpret deep learning technologies in healthcare, many recent attempts in the AI domain have been made to enhance model transparency and understand model functionality. In particular, a unified framework, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was proposed to explain the input features that contribute to the final output, which has been validated on many data-driven applications in healthcare domains . This is also an effective method to select input features by ranking their importance. In Table , an article also employed SHAP analysis to attribute the descriptors for the CNN outcomes . Another effective technique to interpret the learned features of CNN layers is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) , which was used to visualize the clusters of heartbeat data according to glucose levels in . The use of t-SNE can also be generalized to other CNN applications, such as DR detection, to qualitatively analyze the extracted feature maps. Moreover, a recent study also verified the conformance of neural network models in terms of glucose-insulin dynamics . Similar approaches can be used to analyze the performance of DNNs and further enhance interpretability. B. Opportunities and Future Work:
 Instead of solely using data-driven models, integrating the expert knowledge in the learning process can help to better understand the underlying mechanisms of a health condition such as diabetes. Specifically, there are two feasible methods. One is to incorporate the physiological parameters as the input feature of the models, and the other is to use expert knowledge as a guide during the training process. Expert knowledge is also essential to craft safety constrains and calculate the confidence of the model outputs. B. Opportunities and Future Work:
 Many selected articles mentioned that their studies require to be further validated in real-world scenarios , , , , . In this regard, a team from Google took a step forward. They conducted a human-centered study in 11 clinics, applying deep learning to diabetic eye diseases . The results indicate that some socio-environmental factors need to be addressed before the widespread deployment of such automated systems. VI. CONCLUSION:
 In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the current trend in deep learning technologies for diabetes research. We performed a systematic search, selected a collection of articles, and summarized the key information focusing on three areas: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes related complications. In these areas, various DNN architectures and learning techniques have been applied and obtained superior experimental performance that previous conventional machine learning approached. On the other hand, several challenges have been identified from the literature including data availability, feature processing, and model interpretability. In the future, there is great potential to meet these challenges by transferring the latest advances in deep learning technologies into massive multi-modal data of diabetes management.

Manual detection of DR is a difficult task since it can affect the retina, causing structural changes such as Microaneurysms (MAs), Exudates (EXs), Hemorrhages (HMs), and extra blood vessel growth. In this work, a hybrid technique for the detection and classification of Diabetic Retinopathy in fundus images of the eye is proposed. Transfer learning (TL) is used on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to extract features that are combined to generate a hybrid feature vector. This feature vector is passed on to various classifiers for binary and multiclass classification of fundus images. System performance is measured using various metrics and results are compared with recent approaches for DR detection.

Repairing the data problems of sensing devices by artificial intelligence technologies have facilitated the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) and its emerging applications in Healthcare. MIoT has great potential to affect the patient's life. Data collected from smart wearable devices size dramatically increases with data collected from millions of patients who are suffering from diseases such as diabetes. However, sensors or human errors lead to missing some values of the data. The major challenge of this problem is how to predict this value to maintain the data analysis model performance within a good range. In this paper, a complete healthcare system for diabetics has been used, as well as two new algorithms are developed to handle the crucial problem of missed data from MIoT wearable sensors. The proposed work is based on the integration of Random Forest, mean, class' mean, interquartile range (IQR), and Deep Learning to produce a clean and complete dataset. Which can enhance any machine learning model performance. Moreover, the outliers repair technique is proposed based on dataset class detection, then repair it by Deep Learning (DL).

Phung et al. employ deep learning(DL) for predicting the values of the missing data on the healthcare dataset.

 It's noticed that some authors introduced a lot of research on the classification of diabetes, most of the techniques, applying machine learning models, but not concerning the missing data and outlier. But it is very weighty and the model performance is affected. Regarding these limitations in the state of art diabetes classification methods, the main achievement in this work is two enhanced algorithms to clean the data from any missing or outlier values. So the results show that the final model performance is enhanced through altered metrics like accuracy, recall, and MSE. Smart wearable device based data analytics for diabetes detection in MIoT:
 With our day's digital age, a massive number of smart devices have been connected to the Medical Internet of things (MIoT). Connected MIoT devices generate an extensive volume of data. However, the enormous amount of data produced by the connected Medical IoT devices is requiring fast parallel processing platforms. Big data platforms (i.e. Apache Spark) are used to handle and manage large volumes of gathering data from wearable sensors. Thus, big data processing challenges need to be resolved by adopting a big data mining approaches in the classification and detection processes of various diseases. Smart wearable device based data analytics for diabetes detection in MIoT:
 The main idea of the proposed MIoT system is to send the data to the cloud and big data server for analysis. Then the cloud and big data server send back the results of predicting and detecting diabetes (i.e. yes or no) as shown in Fig. . The proposed system consists of the following main parts: Smart wearable device based data analytics for diabetes detection in MIoT:

 In the previous system, the phases that the data passes through cause some errors, due to sensor problems, or human mistakes. These errors may lead to wrong decisions or case handling which can cause disease to enter dangerous stages or even death.

Due to its real-time relevance to everyone's lives, smart healthcare is attracting a lot of interest. With the convergence of IoT, this attention has increased. The leading cause of blindness among persons in their working years is diabetic eye disease.

Review of Literature:
 Researchers have been focusing on connected smart health, the healthcare Internet of ings (Health IoT), and patient monitoring, all of which offer significant promise for AI and IoT technologies. AI techniques and technologies will improve the situation of world health, particularly for diabetic retinopathy. e numerous challenges and achievements in eye care were discussed by researchers, with a focus on the Indian community. ey stated that efficient treatment and potential cures for a number of eye illnesses that may cause vision loss should be available in India by the year 2020. Organizing certification programs for technicians and physicians will help them get the knowledge and abilities necessary for DR identification at an early stage . Numerous techniques have been put out to find DR. is section focuses on deep learning and neural network techniques for multiclass classification. Some researchers have classified fundus pictures into two categories: diabetic, which includes moderate to severe NPDR, and nondiabetic, which denotes the person does not have DR . e authors proposed a method for precisely identifying a class into which a fundus picture may be classified based on these results using a single primary classifier and backpropagation neural organizing processes. Similar to this, a deep learningbased method has been developed for classifying fundus images for human ophthalmologist diagnosis. Based on Inception V3, the authors created a Siamese-like CNN binocular model that can give output from both eyes simultaneously and detect fundus images in both eyes . e authors proposed a hybrid approach for DR detection in which the HE contract constrained adaptive histogram supports the deep learning model (CLACHE). e method uses visual augmentation during the diagnosing process to increase attention and effectiveness. For the dataset of individuals with diabetic retinopathy, the authors used five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to evaluate progress indicators. According to their classification system, images are split into three groups based on the severity of the disease .

Epidemiological survey results show that about one third of diabetes patients have signs of diabetic retinopathy, and another third may suffer from serious retinopathy that threatens vision. However, the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy is still unclear, and there is no systematic method to detect the onset of the disease and effectively predict its occurrence. Methods: In this study, we used medical detection data from diabetic retinopathy patients to determine key biomarkers that induce disease onset through BP neural network algorithm and hierarchical clustering analysis, ultimately obtaining early warning signals of the disease. Results: The key markers that induce diabetic retinopathy have been detected, which can also be used to explore the induction mechanism of disease occurrence and deliver strong warning signal before disease occurrence. We found that multiple clinical indicators that form key markers, such as glycated hemoglobin, serum uric acid, alanine aminotransferase are closely related to the occurrence of the disease. They respectively induced disease from the aspects of the individual lipid metabolism, cell oxidation reduction, bone metabolism and bone resorption and cell function of blood coagulation. Conclusion s : The key markers that induce diabetic retinopathy complications do not act independently, but form a complete module to coordinate and work together before the onset of the disease, and transmit a strong warning signal. The key markers detected by this algorithm are more sensitive and effective in the early warning of disease. Hence, a new method related to key markers is proposed for the study of diabetic microvascular lesions. In clinical prediction and diagnosis, doctors can use key markers to give early warning of individual diseases and make early intervention.","9.3 million people worldwide have become blind due to diabetic retinopathy, with about 90% of cases being preventable. Therefore, predicting and preventing diabetic retinopathy has become a global public health issue that requires enhanced research and practice. Introduction:
 Up to now, diabetes has become the third chronic disease, which is after cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumor diseases. Diabetes is a clinically heterogeneous glucose intolerance syndrome, which is mainly due to the selectivity of immune mediated islet beta cell damage caused by a lack of insulin and glucose metabolism disorders. Chronic hyperglycemia in the body poses serious health risks, and leads to a form of retinopathy, which is known as diabetic retinopathy . Compared with the research on type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, the current studies on the pathogenesis and early warning of diabetes complications are relatively rare. Some scholars have been dedicated to researching the risk factors and related genes that lead to diabetic retinopathy , and the prediction of diabetic retinopathy through retinal images .  investigate the metabolic features of diabetic retinopathy by using metabolomics profiling . The study found significant differences in the concentrations of metabolites among different groups of diabetic retinopathies, and 16 metabolites were identified as common metabolites of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), among which three metabolites were found to be potential markers of diabetic retinopathy progression. The identification of these metabolic features will help to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying diabetic retinopathy and provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of related diseases. Carmen et al. construct the linear relationship between the graduated indicators of the diabetes risk assessment model according to the theory of physique identification . They investigated the feasibility of using complexity analysis of glucose profile to predict the development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. And they found that the complexity metric (detrended fluctuation analysis, DFA) calculated from 24-hour glucose time series using DFA can significantly predict the development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. The results showed that DFA is a significant predictor of type 2 diabetes development, even after adjusting for other clinical and biochemical variables. This method has the potential to identify patients in need of intensified treatment and provide new insights for the prevention and management of diabetes. Shankar et al. constructed a diabetes risk assessment model to study the linear relationship between biochemical indicators, and proposes a deep learning-based automated detection and classification model for fundus diabetic retinopathy images . Chakravarthy et al. discussed the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy of diabetic retinopathy based on artificial intelligence system, and proposed a framework DR-NET using stacked convolutional neural networks for diabetic retinopathy detection from digital fundus images . Progress in artificial intelligence for diabetic retinopathy screening, including artificial intelligence applications in 'real-world settings' are summarized in Gunasekeran's research. The use of artificial intelligence models for diabetic retinopathy risk stratification, improved the efficiency of diabetic retinopathy management . Somasundaram designed a Machine Learning Bagging Ensemble Classifier to identify retinal features for diabetic retinopathy disease diagnosis and early detection using machine learning and ensemble classification method . However, the previous studies on the risk warning of diabetic complications usually relied on the detection of a large number of biochemical indicators or gene sequences, which requires a more complicated detection and diagnosis process."

These sensors can be worn in the form of glasses, jewellery, face masks, wristwatches, fitness bands, tattoo-like devices, bandages or other patches, and textiles. Wearables such as smartwatches have already proved their capability for the early detection and monitoring of the progression and treatment of various diseases, such as COVID-19 and Parkinson disease, through biophysical signals. Next-generation wearable sensors that enable the multimodal and/or multiplexed measurement of physical parameters and biochemical markers in real time and continuously could be a transformative technology for diagnostics, allowing for high-resolution and time-resolved historical recording of the health status of an individual. In this Review, we examine the building blocks of such wearable sensors, including the substrate materials, sensing mechanisms, power modules and decision-making units, by reflecting on the recent developments in the materials, engineering and data science of these components. Finally, we synthesize current trends in the field to provide predictions for the future trajectory of wearable sensors. ","solar panels or biofuel cells) or powerless options through near-field communication. These advances could lead to the evolution of standalone, fully integrated wearable sensors, or a biosensing unit that operates in combination with other ubiquitous personal devices (such as smartphones). Outlook:
 To enable robust long-term (days to weeks) continuous measurement in a wearable format, sensing and sampling technologies should be further matured. In this regard, future trends for advanced sensing units include the use of microneedles, nanoneedles or unconventional sample collection methods (such as face masks) for easy and continuous or on-demand sampling as well as the further integration of micromaterials or nanomaterials and stabilized synthetic biology reactions for signal amplification. Moreover, novel biorecognition elements or assay technologies (such as aptamers, molecularly imprinted polymers, nanozymes, DNAzymes or CRISPR-Cas-powered assays) could be applied to increase sensitivity and facilitate long-term use. Outlook:
 The accuracy of wearables could be improved through multimodal and/or multiplexed sensing by mounting different transducer types and/or simultaneously measuring different analytes and/or samples on the same platform. In addition, increased use of cloud or fog computing, data mining and ML for the extremely large datasets produced by wearable sensors would also help to enable more accurate predictions of the physiological status of users. In this respect, the first prerequisite is to conduct larger prospective cohort studies using wearable sensors to validate their clinical applicability for diagnosis and population-level studies. Before starting these trials, data collection and its use should be planned by considering their implementation in ML models, for both training, validation and testing of these models. Moreover, social acceptance of wearable sensors must be ensured by informing users about the advantages and disadvantages and by integrating them into existing wearable devices or application ecosystems (such as smartwatches or wearable glucometers) and health-care services (such as health insurance policies; see Supplementary information for further discussion). In addition, the integration of wearables into Internet-of-Things applications and the adoption of protocols for data safety and handling (such as blockchain  ) with the establishment of an ethical regulatory framework for wearable data networks could further promote their use. Outlook:
 In the foreseeable future, extension of the capabilities of wearables beyond diagnostic sensing through the integration of feedback loops would pave the way for (third-generation) wearable devices for theranostic applications. Smart bandages, for example, could allow for real-time monitoring of wound healing through pH measurement and, in the case of an infection, treatment by on-demand delivery of antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs. Another trend is to enhance the capabilities of current wearable continuous glucose-monitoring systems to release insulin to the patient in a closed-loop manner."

Using artificial intelligence, it has become possible to extract meaningful information from large volumes of data, in a shorter frame of time, with very less human interference. In effect, convolutional neural networks (a deep learning method) have been taught to recognize pathological lesions from images. Diabetes has high morbidity, with millions of people who need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Deep neural networks offer a great advantage of screening for DR from retinal images, in improved identification of DR lesions and risk factors for diseases, with high accuracy and reliability. This review aims to compare the current evidences on various deep learning models for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR).","fluid or subretinal fluid, neovascularisation have started gaining great interest recently . Research on AI assisted automated OCT analysis to assess OCT biomarkers to predict outcomes of treatment such as intravitreal injections for various retinal disorders is on-going. Role of deep learning and DR screening and its future:
 The AI devices provides a screening decision without requiring an ophthalmologist to interpret the retinal images, hence can be used by physicians who may not normally be involved in eye care. The integration of AI into healthcare, would be expected to radically change clinical practice with more people getting screened for retinopathy. With the exponential increase in the prevalence of diabetes, AI can ease the pressure on the healthcare system, particularly in India and in other lower and middle income countries with large number of people with diabetes to be screened for retinopathy with limited resources. AI based software in ophthalmology provide an easier and more convenient option for the people to detect the disease at an early stage at the physician clinic and hence the patient satisfaction levels could be better. Automated DR screening methods can make the screening process more efficient, cost-effective, reproducible, and accessible. A multicentre study in India (SMART India) will evaluate the clinical and costeffectiveness of automated DR screening in India. The study is funded by the Global Challenge Research Fund from the United Kingdom Research and Innovations (UKRI) with the aim of translating the results globally. Conclusion:
 Automated analysis with integration of AI in DR detection can be safely implemented and appears to be a promising solution for screening large number of people with diabetes globally. DL has shown impressive results of high sensitivity and specificity in automated image analysis of fundus photographs. Artificial intelligence would act as an auxiliary part and a useful assistant in DR screening and provide diagnostic support and cannot replace the role of ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis and management. Future development of AI technology will generate medical advances, and the physicians and ophthalmologists would need to learn how to utilize the technical advances with care. Robust diagnostic AI-based technology to automate DR screening would help increase referral of people with STDR and other retinal diseases to the ophthalmologist / retina specialist for further management and hence would aid in reducing visual impairment. Conclusion:
 The ultimate approach and goal of the future to save healthcare resources and possibly be to incorporate AI into a retinal imaging device fundus cameras that can be used in various locations such as pharmacy, optical shop, etc to screen all people with diabetes."

Yet, efficient monitoring schemes can mitigate or postpone any disorders, mainly by early detecting regions of interest. Nowadays, optical sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) tools can contribute efficiently to such monitoring processes. In this work, we provide information on the adopted imaging schemes and related optical sensors on this topic. The analysis considers both the physiology of the patients and the characteristics of the sensors. Currently, there are multiple approaches considering both visible and infrared bands (multiple ranges), most of them coupled with various AI tools. The source of the data (sensor type) can support different monitoring strategies and imposes restrictions on the AI tools that should be used with. This review provides a comprehensive literature review of AI-assisted DFU monitoring methods. The paper presents the outcomes of a large number of recently published scholarly articles. Furthermore, the paper discusses the highlights of these methods and the challenges for transferring these methods into a practical and trustworthy framework for sufficient remote management of the patients.","bottleneck in model development.

As shown in sub-sections that follow, unsupervised or semi-supervised schemes are efficient for these scenarios. Unsupervised learning techniques:
 Unsupervised learning based models have been used to surpass the problem of labelled data, since these algorithms can infer adequate feature representations of input values, without using labelled data. Typically, in healthcare related studies unsupervised learning manifests as clustering techniques, which detect hidden patterns or groupings in data . Extracting meaningful features from the original raw values is useful for reducing the dimension of feature space and achieving better clustering performance . Semi-supervised learning techniques:
 Other approaches may involve tensor-based  and semi-supervised learning Protopapadakis et al. . Both techniques exploit feature space projections, which allow for better handling of sets of high-order data and/or limited training sets. The former case, i.e., tensor-based learning, imposes canonical/Polyadic (CP) decomposition of rank-R on its weights, leading to a significant reduction of the number of hyperparameters during training. The later case, couples labeled and unlabeled data to form additional regularization terms, resulting in higher performance models. Identified sensor/AI tools synergies:
 Diabetic foot can cause severe morbidity in diabetic patients with a subsequent increased cost for the health care system. Prevention and early diagnosis are the keys to decrease the prevalence of diabetic foot. Due to Covid-19 pandemic evolution, public health guidelines should be reconfigured to support and manage diabetic foot patients including remote consultations. Self-foot assessment is a critical tool for the highly beneficial early detection of ulcers. Development and proper usage of an objective tool that can assess the foot of a diabetic patient are key interventions towards prediction and early diagnosis of diabetic foot with significant benefits for the patient and the health care system. Various sensory systems can be used towards this direction. Table  highlights the most important conclude remarks per sensory system. Grouping of the machine learning approaches in DFU monitoring depending on the range of the electromagnetic spectrum:
 Non-invasive sensors have contributed in a great extend for diabetic foot monitoring. In addition, the recently released datasets captured from these sensors provide a breeding ground for the application of machine learning algorithms. In this section, we group the literature works and the proposed approaches, based on the type of sensor that is utilised during capturing and the electromagnetic spectrum that is covered. In particular, we divide the literature work in four main categories that is works dealing with: i) data captured from the visible spectrum, ii) hyper-spectral imaging data, iii) thermal imaging data, and iv) data from the middle-IR spectrum."

Specifically on people with Diabetic Retinopathy, long periods of hyperglycemia lead to the creation of very fragile blood vessels in the retina, or to the suppression of old ones, leading to problems like hemorrhages or exudates, that may cause blindness. Diabetic Retinopathy can be diagnosed with several devices, but these are mainly too expensive and non-portable, not allowing the screening of a great part of the population. This way, EyeFundusScope was created, being a smartphone based, non-mydriatic, handheld and low-cost Embedded Retinal Imaging System. Image quality depends on the system’s optical alignment and it should provide fundus images with a wide field-of-view. A communication protocol for streaming video and capturing still fundus images, from an UVC-Compliant Camera was developed, after a careful examination of the types of cameras that could be integrated in the system. Such cameras can be placed meticulously in the compact optical system, and suppress issues related to the different specifications of smartphone cameras, that often vary according to the manufacturers. An approach for low level control of high resolution and low cost camera modules was also evaluated. With the system developed, the user can select Internal Fixation Point Actuators, that are extremely important for this diagnosis, since they allow a fixed target for the patient to fixate on, reducing image aberrations due to its eye movement and providing wider field-of-view images. In the future, the UVC-Compliant Camera and Internal Fixation Points Actuators should be integrated on the current prototype, providing an accurate Diabetic Retinopathy screening tool which can enhance the early treatment of the pathology to a greater percentage of the population.","Image Sensor Integration in the Scope of EyeFundusScope: a Retinal Imaging System for Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Assessment Keywords: Diabetic Retinopathy, Fundus Camera, UVC Compliant Cameras, Fixation Targets, Mechanical Prototyping Ac kn o w l e d ge me n t s:

This has been especially beneficial for developing countries with limited infrastructure, where testing often involves sending specimens off-site and waiting for hours or days for results. However, the development of POCT devices has been challenging, with simplicity, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness being key factors in making these tests feasible. Nanotechnology has played a crucial role in achieving this goal, by not only making the tests possible but also masking their complexity. In this article, recent developments in POCT devices that benefit from nanotechnology are discussed. Microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technologies are highlighted as major drivers of point-of-care testing, particularly in infectious disease diagnosis. These technologies enable various bioassays to be used at the point of care. The article also addresses the challenges faced by these technological advances and interesting future trends. The benefits of point-of-care testing are significant, especially in developing countries where medical care is shifting towards prevention, early detection, and managing chronic conditions.

Consequently, the team developed a wireless real-time glucose monitoring system based on a wearable Cu 2 O NP sensor which transmitted the concentration data to a smartphone via Bluetooth connection . Wearable Devices:
 The development of biosensors capable of detecting glucose in other biofluids such as tears and urine is an exciting area of research, as it could revolutionize point-of-care glucose monitoring for individuals with diabetes. The use of glucose-responsive photonic crystal hydrogels shows promise as a simple and cost-effective optical sensor for detecting glucose levels. A polyelectrolyte photonic hydrogel with GOx immobilization has been investigated as a naked-eye optical sensor. The cationic polyelectrolyte poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) expands and has a clear pH response in the form of a red shift with decreasing pH, while the enzymatic reaction of GOx with glucose in the hydrogel results in a reduction in pH. Furthermore, Elsherif et al. introduced phenylboronic acid (PBA) groups into a photonic microstructural hydrogel and used it to fabricate a wearable contact lens optical sensor in which the photonic crystal hydrogel expands when bound to glucose in tears. The integration of this technology into wearable contact lenses for continuous glucose monitoring is a particularly exciting development, as it offers a non-invasive and convenient way to monitor glucose levels in tears. This could provide individuals with diabetes with real-time glucose monitoring and alerts, potentially improving their quality of life and reducing the risk of complications associated with poorly managed diabetes. Overall, the development of glucose-responsive photonic hydrogels is an exciting area of research with promising applications in point-of-care glucose monitoring and diabetes management .

 Various novel detection methods can be utilized to aid in the development of pointof-care (POC) diagnostics, including electrochemical biosensors, fluorescence biosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensors, and magnetic biosensors . These methods have been empowered by the booming development of microfluidics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and nanotechnology, which have substantially promoted the development of POC devices such as lab-on-a-chip (LOC), lab-on-a-disc (LOAD), lateral flow, miniaturized polymerase chain reaction (PCR), isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA), and microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs) . The combination of novel biosensors, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has the potential to accelerate the development of POC diagnostics toward more efficient and intelligent diagnosis.

Design This is a multicentre platform development study based on retrospective, cross-sectional data sets. Images were labelled by two-level certificated graders as the ground truth. According to the UK DR screening guideline, a DL model based on colour retinal images with five-dimensional classifiers, namely image quality, retinopathy, maculopathy gradability, maculopathy and photocoagulation, was developed.

These technologies have generated a lot of “hype,” but their real-world effectiveness will depend on patients’ uptake. Our objective was to describe patients’ perceptions of the use of BMDs and AI in healthcare. We recruited adult patients with chronic conditions in France from the “Community of Patients for Research” (ComPaRe). Participants (1) answered quantitative and open-ended questions about the potential benefits and dangers of using of these new technologies and (2) participated in a case-vignette experiment to assess their readiness for using BMDs and AI in healthcare.

Overall, 20% considered that the benefits of technology (e.g., improving the reactivity in care and reducing the burden of treatment) greatly outweighed the dangers. Only 3% of participants felt that negative aspects (inadequate replacement of human intelligence, risks of hacking and misuse of private patient data) greatly outweighed potential benefits. We found that 35% of patients would refuse to integrate at least one existing or soon-to-be available intervention using BMDs and AI-based tools in their care.

 The development of wearable biometric monitoring devices (BMDs) (i.e., sensors embedded in smartphones or wearable equipment to collect physiological, biological, environmental or behavioral information) allows for remote, high-frequency and high-resolution monitoring of patients' health outside the hospital.  Coupled with the progress of artificial intelligence (AI), the thousands of data points collected from BMDs may help in informing diagnosis, predicting patient outcomes, and helping care professionals select the best treatment for their patients.  These two technical revolutions have generated a lot of hope and ""hype,"" and myriad digital and AI-based tools for healthcare have been developed.  Today, AI can outperform medical practitioners in the analysis of skin lesions, pathology slides, electrocardiograms or medical imaging data.  Continuous glucose monitoring systems combined with closed-loop insulin delivery systems can improve type 2 diabetes mellitus control.  Multiple AI algorithms using data from BMDs are being tested to detect unknown disease, predict patient outcomes and provide reactive guidance or proactive interventions.  Despite these good preliminary results, the real-world effectiveness of such interventions that occur outside of hospitals is still uncertain and will depend on patients' engagement, uptake and adherence to these interventions.  The literature on patients' views of the use of BMDs and AI in healthcare is scarce and relies mainly on context-specific studies, with limited generalizability, and on evaluations of specific interventions reported in some trials evaluating these technologies, which do not reflect whether patients would have engaged in these interventions outside of the research context.  In this study, we aimed to describe chronic patients' perceptions of the use of BMDs and AI-based tools in healthcare and assess their readiness to integrate such technologies in their care. RESULTS:

 There is no doubt that digital transformation in healthcare will continue. Big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, EHR-integrated, web-based, and mobile apps will improve, enhance, and adopt diabetes care. Future care for diabetes:
 Medical and consumer devices collect a vast amount and variety of data, including continuous glucose monitoring data, insulin pump data, heart rate, hours of sleep, the number of steps walked, movement captured by wristbands or watches, hydration, geolocation, and barometric pressure. Future care for diabetes:
 Next-generation developments of CDS will leverage big data and prioritize clinical actions based on data analysis, delivering maximum benefits to a given patient at the point of care. In the meantime, innovative care models and delivery methods will emerge. Future care for diabetes:

CDSs facilitate doctors in clinical diagnosis and overcome clinical inertia in terms of prescribing habits. Future care for diabetes:
 In addition, patient-centered care should consider patients' preferences in care decisions and identify effective methods to communicate CDS information to patients. Doctors need to be more tech-savvy in learning the latest technologies on patient care; patients want more empowerment by participating in self-care and care decision-making. Future care for diabetes:
 Furthermore, increased number of diabetes journals publish AI-related technologies in diabetes care. Now, doctors must learn new skills and knowledge on AI tools, which have become part of diabetes health care . Future care for diabetes:
 A path forward may be computerized virtual coaches replacing human counseling; virtual doctors will be able to fully engage in the diagnosis, treatment, and continuous monitoring of chronic diseases. Future care for diabetes:
 CDSs can be as good or superior to human doctors when prescribing diabetes medicines and may be more effective in overcoming clinical inertia as CDSs can remove human biases and habits. Future care for diabetes:
 Considering the fact that the physician shortage is growing and 10.5% of the population has diabetes, CDSs play an important role in treating diabetes and more efficiently using clinical resources ."

Improvement of medication adherence:
 The majority of people with diabetes require lifelong oral or injectable medications. The use of a medication notification service, via a smartphone, can help improve their medication adherence . Although not directly related to people with DM, recent attempts have been made to improve medication adherence for the treatment of schizophrenia by combining sensors with oral medications . Possibly, therefore, this methodology will expand for the management of various other chronic diseases where adherence to drugs is important. Improvement of medication adherence:
 For insulin users, an insulin dose calculator has been developed to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates in a meal and provide an insulin dose based thereon . In addition, for the convenience of insulin users, a digital insulin pen that supports automatic detection of insulin type, the fine adjustment of insulin dosage, and a notification function for injection time and hypoglycemia was released . Increasing compliance with insulin use is very important, and it is also necessary to consider the application of IoT (Internet of Things) to monitor insulin use and the system that provides effective education.

 Digital health equipment for the evaluation and management of diabetes-specific chronic complications has also been developed and launched. For example, fundoscopy systems, using smartphones or handheld cameras, are expanding in scope to screen for diabetic retinopathy . The collected images can be graded using machine learning, and effectively screened for persons in need of treatment by an ophthalmologist . Diabetic foot ulcer screening equipment has also appeared , and is designed to scan the foot when the patient is on a weight scale.

However, diagnosis is often too late to prevent irreversible damage caused by these linked conditions. This study describes the development of an integrated test, automated and not requiring laboratory blood analysis, for screening of these conditions. First, a random forest model was developed by retrospectively analyzing the influence of various risk factors (obtained quickly and non-invasively) on cardiovascular risk. Next, a deep-learning model was developed for prediction of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images by a modified and re-trained InceptionV3 image classification model. The input was simplified by automatically segmenting the blood vessels in the retinal image. The technique of transfer learning enables the model to capitalize on existing infrastructure on the target device, meaning more versatile deployment, especially helpful in low-resource settings. The models were integrated into a smartphone-based device, combined with an inexpensive 3D-printed retinal imaging attachment. Accuracy scores, as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve, the learning curve, and other gauges, were promising. This test is much cheaper and faster, enabling continuous monitoring for two damaging complications of diabetes. It has the potential to replace the manual methods of diagnosing both diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular risk, which are time consuming and costly processes only done by medical professionals away from the point of care, and to prevent irreversible blindness and heart-related complications through faster, cheaper, and safer monitoring of diabetic complications.

 Approximately four hundred and twenty million people worldwide have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and this is predicted only to increase. Of those with diabetes, approximately one-third are expected to be diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy (DR), a chronic eye disease that can progress to irreversible vision loss, and the leading cause of blindness among working-class individuals (Facts About Diabetic Eye Disease, 2015). Early detection, which is vital for effective prognosis, relies on skilled readers and is both labor and time-intensive, which limits who can be helped. Skilled readers perform prognosis by analysis of swelling in the retina that threatens vision, of evidence of poor retinal blood vessel circulation, or of abnormal vessels or tissue in the retina . Moreover, the manual nature of DR screening methods creates inconsistency among readers . Introduction:
 Xie et al.  found that patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy have an increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (which can manifest in abnormalities in ocular blood vessels), meaning that these patients must be followed up with more closely to prevent cardiovascular disease. Due to this connection, simultaneous monitoring has several advantages to improve early detection and risk prediction of incident cardiovascular disease. Introduction:
 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world, for both men and women. In the U.S., 1 in every 4 deaths is due to cardiovascular disease. Although cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of deaths globally, many do not act on risk factors and warning signs although about half (47%) of Americans have at least one significant risk factor . Introduction:
 . For these extremely prevalent problems, current methods (detailed below) of risk detection/prediction are costly, slow, inaccessible, and often inconsistent. Due to the emergence of more accessible machine learning, machine learning and deep learning are being applied to various medical problems as well. Thus far application of these methods to automate prediction of diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular risk, while accurate, have been resource-intensive and computationally costly, creating an inability to apply these methods on devices in low-resource settings. As well, these tests have been separated (see ""Discussion"" section for further comparison). This study aimed to apply various machine learning/deep learning algorithms to more cheaply, quickly, accessibly, and consistently monitor diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular disease in a comprehensive test. Introduction:
 A recent publication by EyePACS  revealed the use of retinal fundus images in the prediction of diabetic retinopathy. Introduction:
 Research has shown that many other aspects of health may be predicted via the analysis of retinal fundus images (age, sex, systolic BP, and smoker % among others), which are all risk factors of cardiovascular disease."

Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe and widely spread eye disease which can be regarded as manifestation of diabetes on retina. Retinopathy literally means damage to retina. There are two types of retinopathy. The most common type is background or non proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Background or non proliferative diabetic retinopathy may be associated with macula edema. Exudates are the primary sign of diabetic retinopathy. So detection of exudates is very important in diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. To detect the exudates, segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images is necessary. For this, several classes of methods have been commonly used. Processing of large data and classification of data is much difficult using other methods. Hence a method for the automatic detection and classification of disease severity is aimed at this work. The comparison of several soft computing tools for the classification of diabetic retinopathy stages has been used. The platform for implementing the image processing and neural network is MATLAB.

 The retina, choroid, photoreceptor cells, blood vessels, and optic nerve are all located in the fundus, which is the posterior region of the eye. Introduction:
 An essential tool in the toolbox of ophthalmologists and other medical professionals is retinal fundus imaging, which makes it easier to identify and track vision-threatening eye disorders throughout time. Introduction:
 This advanced method is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of conditions including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD)  [2] . The chronic and degenerative eye illness known as AMD affects the macula, which is essential for clear vision. Introduction:
 AMD, a common condition in the elderly, is characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation in wet AMD and drusen deposition in dry AMD. It is now the primary cause of vision loss. Introduction:
 Known as the ""silent thief of sight,"" glaucoma is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure that can take many different forms. To avoid damage to the optic nerve, early diagnosis is crucial. Diabetes-related retinopathy (DR) is a condition that damages the retinal blood vessels. Introduction:
 It increases the chance of blindness and visual impairment, hence early treatment is essential   . Introduction:
 Diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and AMD involves an integrated approach that includes clinical evaluations and sophisticated imaging. Fundus photography provides highly precise images of the retina, while optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers cross-sectional views that facilitate the identification of macular abnormalities. Introduction:
 Measurements of intraocular pressure, eye tests, and OCT assess structural changes in glaucoma . The diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy includes retinal vascular abnormalities being highlighted by fluorescein angiography, fundus photography, and OCT for macular examination. Introduction:
 Automated grading systems facilitate efficient screening, emphasizing the importance of regular eye examinations for early detection and timely intervention. Introduction:
 The diagnosis and continuous monitoring of common eye illnesses are revolutionized by the quick advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based image identification and grading   . Introduction:
 Given that eye issues frequently do not show any symptoms at first, it is critical to step up efforts to semi-automate mass screening programs in order to identify diseases early and conduct routine monitoring. Introduction:
 With quick treatments to avoid visual damage or blindness, screening efficiency, efficacy, and financial viability will all be improved by this automation. AI integration has great potential to transform the manual categorization of retinal fundus images and bring about improved ophthalmology diagnostic capabilities . Introduction:
 In the realm of retinal vascular segmentation for medical imaging, the two predominant approaches, supervised and unsupervised methods, play a crucial role in automating the intricate task, substantially reducing time and effort compared to manual segmentation, particularly in addressing conditions like diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness   .

Currently, China has the largest population living with diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing field and its applications to diabetes could enable the delivery of better management services for people with diabetes. This perspective summarized the latest findings of digital technologies and AI use in the following areas of diabetes care, mainly including screening and risk predictions of diabetes and diabetic complications, precise monitoring and intervention combined with new technologies, and mobile health application in self-management support for people with diabetes. Challenges to promote further use of AI in diabetes care included data standardization and integration, performance of AI-based medical devices, motivation of patients, and sensitivity to privacy. In summary, although the AI applications in clinical practice is still at an early stage, we are moving toward a new paradigm for diabetes care with the rapid development and emerging application of AI.","initiation of insulin significantly decreased HbA 1c in patients with T2D, while patient engagement with diabetes education was significantly associated with improvement of glucose control . With digital health, diabetes self-management is becoming more comprehensive and simultaneously more patient-centered. Discussion:
 For the application of digital health and AI in diabetes care, challenges still exist. To achieve high-quality AI-based medical devices, data standardization and data integration are vital. The participation and motivation of people with diabetes, ethics, and the cost also influence the application of AI. Good performance is the key to promote the use of AI-based medical devices in healthcare settings. A multicenter real-world validation study of seven automated AI-based DR screening systems summarized that although high negative predictive values (82.72%-93.69%) were observed, sensitivities varied widely (50.98%-85.90%) and the DR screening algorithms showed significant performance differences . Besides, a potential barrier to promote widespread adoption of AI is sensitivity to privacy. Future researches are required to address these challenges. Discussion:
 In summary, AI is full of exciting and important prospects for diabetes care. A wide use of AI techniques in both clinical settings and communities is timely to enhance prevention and management of diabetes. Despite the great potential, the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage. We are moving toward a new paradigm for diabetes care with the emerging application of AI. Prediction, screening, monitoring and early intervention combined with AI will therefore be major factors in reducing the disease burden of diabetes.

Not only will this help develop trust within the medical community, but it will also tell basic researchers as to where they should focus their efforts. CHAPTER 3 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH DIAGNOSIS 3.1 INTRODUCTION:
 Call attention to the need of keeping realistic expectations, namely that the performance of AI algorithms, including Deep Learning, should not be expected to be superior to that of the training sets. CHAPTER 3 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH DIAGNOSIS 3.1 INTRODUCTION:
 Applications of Deep Learning algorithms in healthcare contexts, on the other hand, enable the possibility of consistently presenting high-quality discoveries. This is especially true in situations where robust training sets reflect the greatest levels of medical skill. CHAPTER 3 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH DIAGNOSIS 3.1 INTRODUCTION:
 As a result, it is a commendable goal for these kinds of applications to ensure that everyone has access to medical treatment of a sufficient standard. ADVANCES IN AI APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAL IMAGING:
 In the sections that follow, we will investigate various applications of Deep Learning. ADVANCES IN AI APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAL IMAGING:
 We will place a special focus on having a quantitative understanding of the characteristics of the data sets, the nature of the problem specification, and the nature of the comparison standard that was used for labeling the data sets. ADVANCES IN AI APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAL IMAGING:
 Both of the examples that will be used are from the field of medical imaging; specifically, diabetic retinopathy and dermatology. Both of these examples will be used. Detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images:
 Imaging the retina through the pupil in a noninvasive manner allows for the detection of several eye ailments. Detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images:
 Because the number of diabetic patients is rising at an alarming rate, it is even more important to test these patients on a routine basis for diabetic retinopathy in order to reduce the risk of long-term vision loss caused by the condition. Detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images:
 In addition, this type of screening has the potential to detect early warning signals of cardiovascular disease as well as other eye diseases. Detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images:
 The increased demand for screening of this kind and the corresponding growth in the necessity for expert analysis are the driving forces behind the goal of developing a quantitative retinal image analysis that can be performed at a cheap cost. Detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus images:
 It makes no difference whether the pupil is dilated (mydriatic) or not (non-mydriatic); in any case, routine imaging for screening is accomplished using the particularly manufactured optics of a 'fundus camera,' with several pictures produced at different orientations (fields, see Figure .1)."

The development of retinopathy significantly depends on how long a person has had diabetes. Initially, there may be no symptoms or just a slight vision problem due to impairment of the retinal blood vessels. Later, it may lead to blindness. Recognizing the early clinical signs of DR is very important for intervening in and effectively treating DR. Thus, regular eye check-ups are necessary to direct the person to a doctor for a comprehensive ocular examination and treatment as soon as possible to avoid permanent vision loss. Nevertheless, due to limited resources, it is not feasible for screening. As a result, emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, for the automatic detection and classification of DR are alternative screening methodologies and thereby make the system cost-effective. People have been working on artificial-intelligence-based technologies to detect and analyze DR in recent years. This study aimed to investigate different machine learning styles that are chosen for diagnosing retinopathy. Thus, a bibliometric analysis was systematically done to discover different machine learning styles for detecting diabetic retinopathy. The data were exported from popular databases, namely, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. These data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer in terms of publications, top countries, sources, subject area, top authors, trend topics, co-occurrences, thematic evolution, factorial map, citation analysis, etc., which form the base for researchers to identify the research gaps in diabetic retinopathy detection and classification.","traditional ML styles to deep learning styles used in the literature. It aids researchers in better understanding the automated diabetic retinopathy detection system's motives, necessity, methodology, and justifications. It provides deep insights into various kinds of datasets and suitable methods. Discussion and Observations:
 Most researchers used publicly available datasets, and few used private datasets collected from the hospital. However, in either case, the issues were as follows: Discussion and Observations:
 (i) First, all images collected belonged to a single modality and were captured from one particular device from one hospital. To overcome such issues, images must be captured from different devices under different circumstances, and multimodal images, such as OCT and fundus images, may be used. (ii) Second, fewer DR images may lead to overfitting. Thus, the size of the dataset must be increased, or alternative ML styles, such as semi-supervised, self-supervised, and colearning techniques, may be used to produce a good model with better performance. (iii) The third issue may be due to imbalance, i.e., a biased dataset, which may be avoided by adequately collecting DR images. Discussion and Observations:
 In addition to the above, there may be issues of non-uniform illumination and low contrast. Since the eye structure is spherical, it leads to brightness at the center and becomes darker in the surrounding. Discussion and Observations:
 Thus, a robust classification model with high accuracy and speed could be possible that considers these points, and hence, can be deployed on a server to be used by ordinary people. Discussion and Observations:
 Various image segmentation and ML styles are discussed in this paper. For better segmentation and classification, useful features must be extracted, such as the intensity, statistical, textural, grey-level co-occurrence matrix, moments, standard deviation, and deep features (pixel level and super-pixel level) in the R, G, B, and intensity channels for both greyscale and color images. Conclusions:
 This paper presents a literature review of different machine learning styles for diabetic retinopathy detection. It discusses datasets and the selected papers based on image segmentation, traditional ML styles, DL methods, and the parameters used for quantifying the performance of various classification models. Conclusions:
 It also explores statistical data in DR detection and classification. The quantitative analysis was based on the Scopus and WoS databases from 2000 to 2021, with 811 documents published in various journals and conferences, including different kinds of funding received by researchers worldwide working with other organizations. It was observed that various research studies were carried out using supervised learning and, recently, deep learning. Future work can be focused on working with a balanced and multimodal dataset. The second point is to use semi-supervised, self-supervised, and co-learning techniques with deep neural networks. This paper may help researchers to narrow the research spectrum and form hypotheses by identifying the gaps."

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) technology can provide automatic decision-making for DR grading application. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the AI model is one of challenges that limited the effectiveness of the WSNs-aided DR grading application. Regarding this issue, we propose a WSN architecture and a parallel deep learning framework (HybridLG) for actualizing automatic DR grading and achieving a fundus image-based deep learning model with superior classification performance, respectively. In particular, the framework constructs a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a Transformer backbone in a parallel manner. A novel lightweight deep learning model named MobileViT-Plus is proposed to implement the Transformer backbone of the HybridLG, and a model training strategy inspired by an ensemble learning strategy is designed to improve the model generalization ability. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed HybridLG framework, obtaining excellent performance in grading diabetic retinopathy with strong generalization performance. Our work is significant for guiding the studies of WSNs-aided DR grading and providing evidence for supporting the efficacy of the AI technology in DR grading applications.","patients with diabetes. Despite these advancements, DR remains a significant public health concern, particularly in countries with low-and middle-income levels. Thus, there is a continued need for research to develop cost-effective, scalable and accessible solutions for DR detection and management. WSNs-Aided DR Grading:
 WSNs have been widely applied in various fields, including medical image processing, and have shown potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of retinal image classification tasks. In particular, WSN-based systems have been utilized for the classification of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic diseases. Delia [4] reviewed the role of retinal imaging and mobile technologies in tele-ophthalmology applications for diabetic retinopathy screening and management. They claimed that telemedicine is a worthy tool to support health caregivers in the effective management and prevention of diabetes. Arun et al.  proposed a scalable cloud-based teleophthalmology architecture via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for the diagnosis of AMD; patients wear a head-mounted camera to send their retinal fundus images to the secure and private cloud drive storage for personalized disease severity detection and predictive progression analysis. Saswat et al.  introduced a fully wearable, wireless soft electronic system that offers a portable, highly sensitive tracking of eye movements via the combination of skin-conformal sensors and a virtual reality system. Deep Learning-Based DR Grading:
 Deep learning has shown promising results in the field of diabetic retinopathy grading. The use of deep learning can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of DR grading, which is critical for the early detection and timely treatment of DR. For example, Gulshan et al.  proposed a deep learning system for the automated grading of DR using a large dataset of retinal images. It presented that the deep learning algorithms had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting diabetic retinopathy and macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. Wang et al.  introduced a deep learning system for the automated grading of DR using a multi-level approach. This technology offers the potential to increase the efficiency and accessibility of DR screening programs. Wu et al.  proposed a Vision Transformer-based method to recognize the grade of diabetic retinopathy, highlighting that an attention mechanism based on a Vision Transformer model is promising for the diabetic retinopathy grade recognition task. Achieving interesting early results using only a few colour features, Teresa et al.  introduced a novel Gaussian-sampling approach based on a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework which enables ophthalmologists to assess the reliability of the system's decision. Building upon this idea,  addressed the multiple instance classification problem in OCT images using MIL techniques and achieved significant success. This is particularly effective because the morphological changes induced by diabetic macular edema (DME) are sparsely distributed in the B-scan images of the OCT volume. Additionally, OCT data are commonly labeled at a coarse level, making MIL an appropriate approach. Eugenio et al.  presented preliminary numerical results obtained from the classification of healthy eye fundus images versus those with severe diabetic retinopathy using the MIL algorithm. Zhu et al.  tackled the challenge of classifying referable diabetic retinopathy (rDR) and segmenting lesions using self-supervised equivariant learning and attention-based MIL."

Blood diagnostics are the benchmark against which wearable systems are evaluated, and lower target concentration, lag times, and sample variation are challenges to be addressed. Progress in wearable sensor technology has been significant; flexible substrates have been facilitated by new nanomaterials, polymers, and novel fabrication technologies. To date, diabetes monitoring has been the commercial and technology benchmark, with glucose and lactate extensively used to demonstrate proof of concept in research devices. Emerging biomarkers from genome and proteome research are generating clinical interest as biomarkers linked to specific diseases. Currently, many commercial diagnostic assays monitor single biomarkers (e.g., glucose), but the possibility to monitor multiple biomarkers promises more efficient health monitoring where multiple parameters inform clinical diagnosis.

One of the industries that has a critical direct impact on humans, is the healthcare industry. While IoT technologies can be seen in medical supply chains within the healthcare sector, however, IoT technologies are still not widely adopted in other areas and services within the healthcare sector. The number of patients living with diabetes has increased drastically over the past four decades and is expected to increase even more over the next ones. The disease currently has no cure, and if the patients are not monitored and get the right treatment at the right time, it might end a patient’s life. The IoT is said to be a game-changer for the healthcare industry and the aim of this paper is to review and investigate how IoT technologies and solutions can improve the quality of life and aid the people living with the chronic disease. Our findings suggest that IoT can aid in patient monitoring, including the continuous glucose monitoring, and also can assist in providing a healthier lifestyle for patients through activity and diet tracking. In addition, we have identified key challenges for IoT adoptions and implementations in healthcare within the scope of this research.","periodically. The passive tag does not need a battery and it works by using the energy transmitted by the reader . By integrating sensor technologies into passive RFID tags, a lot of completely new applications to the IoT context would be enabled, especially in e-health . Continuous glucose monitoring:
 Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an advanced way for people living with diabetes to monitor real-time glucose readings, the CGM monitors the glucose level in the user's blood and the device is connected to an insulin pump with an automated suspension of insulin infusion . Several CGM systems utilizing IoT-based solutions have previously been presented. These systems collect glucose data and store it in a hospital information system, which makes it possible for medical staff to access real-time data from their patients . Since the first CGM was presented and made available in 1999, several continuous glucose monitors have continued to evolve to become more accurate and user-friendly . Statistics have demonstrated that CGM may reduce patient's long-term complications between 40% and 75% of the time . The CGM can also be equipped with an alarm system, which may help the patient to take the correct actions when it comes to their diet, physical experience and remind them when it is time to take their medications . Gia et al.  proposed an advanced IoT-based system for real-time glucose monitoring, body temperature and contextual data. Through this system, healthcare personnel and caregivers can easily monitor the patients at any time via a web-browser or an application on their smart-phones .  conducted experiments using a proposed IoT-based virtual sensor to continuously measure type 2 diabetes patients. The sensor measures glucose levels in connection with additional patient information and other indicators, such as, the body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, age, presence of diabetes mellitus in first-degree relatives, and HDL cholesterol from a physical sensor connected to the IoT network. Others created glucose-monitoring applications for medical journal keeping . Activity-and diet tracking:
 According to the World Health Organization, 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on a daily basis, will help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes . In addition, a healthy diet, avoiding sugar to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight is important . Using IoT-technology such as smart watches or wristband sensors can easily monitor the patient's activity level. The smart watches can monitor walking steps taken, distance, calories burned, pace, active versus inactive time etc. Some of them also offer diet-tracking capabilities . In addition, researchers developed a wearable sensor that can stick to a single tooth to track the user's diet, based on the chemical changes in their mouth. The sensors communicate with a mobile device through a wireless network, and transmit information on the intake of glucose, alcohol and salt . The data collected from the watches/wristbands can easily be transmitted to a connected application, giving a complete overview of the patients' activity level and diet . This information can also be shared with the patient's contact persons and the patient's doctor."

The developed scheme appraised an accuracy of 84.29% from 25 diabetes patients' data. A web portal is also developed to monitor the patients' health status continuously. However, the performance is relatively low for practical use. C. DIABETES:
 In another work, a diabetes monitoring and prediction framework is proposed in  utilizing IoT and machine learning techniques. The system used a blood glucose meter, Arduino, and GSM modem as hardware components. The experimental data are retrieved using the glucose meter using an edge device like Arduino and processed in the microcontroller. The decision of the processed data is automatically sent to mediators through a GSM modem. The author found the Random Tree classifier to provide the highest accuracy, and lowest training time among the four used algorithms, and the value are 97.87% and 0.03 seconds, respectively. However, the glucose sensor and Arduino could not be operated at the same time. Further, Rghioui et al.  introduced an intelligent framework for diabetes-infected patients monitoring using machine learning architectures in IoT networks to monitor physical activity, glucose level, and body temperature. For data collection purposes, a glucometer, temperature sensor, and motion sensor are used at the patient's end. The collected data are transferred to the database station using a smartphone through 5G networks. The patient's records are classified using six classification algorithms, and the minimal sequential optimization (SMO) obtained the best accuracy of 99.66%. Whenever any abnormality is found, a notification text is sent to the doctors to take proper steps for treatment. However, the latency is comparatively high in this system. Afterward, Godi et al.  developed a healthcare monitoring framework to diagnose and monitor disease using machine learning modalities through IoT networks. Various wearable devices are utilized to retrieve data from patients from different scenarios like homes and hospitals. In addition, a diabetes dataset from the Kaggle repository  is used for experiments. Machine learning techniques classified the data based on the presence of abnormality. Among four classifiers, SVM achieved an accuracy of 80.51%, precision of 76%, recall of 65%, and F1-Score of 70% for the positive diabetes class. The predicted results are shared with the physicians, mediators, and patient's caregivers. However, the performance is relatively low for real-time implementation."
