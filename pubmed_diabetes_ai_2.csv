In Ghana, there is a significant incidence of stroke, yet systematic reviews highlight a lack of comprehensive data on stroke in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana. Additionally, information on the spatial and spatiotemporal distribution of stroke risk across Ghana's 16 regions remains limited. The objective of this study was to study the spatial and spatiotemporal distribution of stroke relative risk, identify regions with high-risk regions and associated predictors."

EDCs operate through various mechanisms, including receptor binding, interference with hormone production pathways, modification of hormone-transporting proteins, or disturbance of hormonal metabolic processes. Evidence links EDCs to several health conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Fortunately, the field of biomarker discovery for metabolic and endocrine disorders is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by advancements in metabolomics, multi-omics integration, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced diagnostics. Cutting-edge analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of novel biomarkers for early disease detection, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Metabolomics has played a crucial role in unraveling disease mechanisms, identifying biochemical signatures of metabolic dysfunctions, and bridging traditional and modern medical approaches. However, challenges remain in clinical validation, reproducibility, and specificity of these biomarkers. The incorporation of multi-omics technologies such as genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomic has provided a more comprehensive view of metabolic dysregulation. Future advancements in machine learning, AI-driven data analytics, and single-cell omics are expected to revolutionize precision medicine by enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes. As biomarker research continues to evolve, the convergence of high-throughput technologies, computational approaches, and clinical validation efforts will be critical in ensuring their translation into routine medical practice."

We measure pancreas size and shape using morphological measurements from early development through aging (ages 0-90). Our goals are to (1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for artificial intelligence (AI) based pancreas measurement, (2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and (3) detect potential deviations in type 2 diabetes. We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged with abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients did not have cancer, pancreas pathology, sepsis, or trauma. We resampled the scans to 3 mm isotropic resolution, segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed pancreas volume trajectories in 1858 control patients across contrast CT, non-contrast CT, and MRI to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends. Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used covariate-adjusted generative additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) regression to model pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2 diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with type 2 diabetes. We selected CT for the main analyses of this study, since the MRI appeared to yield different pancreas measurements than CT using our AI-based method on this dataset of clinically acquired scans. When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13 morphological features were significantly different between patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons corrections). Additionally, we characterized normative morphological aging trends of the pancreas across 13 morphological measurements. We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape of the pancreas are altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and 675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a clinical setting."

This review evaluates the current landscape and future potential of AID systems without meal announcement, particularly focusing on real-world insights from open-source AID (OS-AID) technologies. Although commercial AID systems operating in hybrid closed-loop (HCL) mode have improved glycaemic outcomes, they remain dependent on manual meal announcement and user-driven actions, limiting their real-world utility. Current versions of OS-AID systems, developed by the diabetes community, can allow operation without meal announcements, presenting an opportunity to move closer to truly automated diabetes management. Recent clinical trials suggest that OS-AID systems can effectively manage glucose levels without meal announcements, achieving glucose levels comparable with those obtained by AID systems in HCL mode, with the potential of reduced management burden for users. However, practical challenges persist, including the need for expert configuration and handling of rapid changes in insulin sensitivity, such as during exercise or rapid glucose fluctuations following predicted low-glucose. This review synthesises insights from user and healthcare professional experiences, and emerging clinical evidence. It highlights the fact that successful implementation of AID without meal announcement requires advanced algorithmic responsiveness, user personalisation and ongoing clinician engagement. Looking forward, integrating adjunctive therapies, artificial intelligence and enhanced physiological modelling will likely enhance system performance to drive the next generation of diabetes care towards wider adoption and true 'set-and-forget' functionality."

Despite its clinical importance, progress in diabetes research is often constrained by the limited availability of comprehensive datasets and robust predictive models. To address these challenges, researchers are increasingly turning to big data analytics and machine learning (ML) methodologies. This study presents the development of an ML-based system aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes and classifying its various types. A novel dataset, termed Diabetes Types Dataset, was constructed by integrating four heterogeneous dataset sources: paediatrics data from the Mansoura University Children Hospital repository, the Pima Indian Diabetes (PIMA) dataset, the Pone dataset, and a Gestational Diabetes dataset. The classification of diabetes types was approached as a multiclass problem using a suite of supervised ML algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Adaptive Boosting, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Model performance was evaluated using several metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Mean Squared Error, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. Among the models tested, the ANN classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving a peak performance of 99.98%. Further validation was conducted using an external dataset referred to as diabetes_prediction, which confirmed the model's robustness with consistent accuracy. Additionally, the proposed system was applied to a publicly available dataset, diabetes_Dataset, containing 34 features used to predict 12 distinct types of diabetes efficiently. The results suggest that this ML-driven approach can significantly enhance the ability of healthcare professionals to detect and classify diabetes types, thereby supporting early intervention and improved disease management."

Predicting the evolution of these diseases remains a significant clinical challenge because microbial, host, behavioral, and systemic determinants interact to produce substantial inter-individual variability. In recent decades, periodontal care has transitioned from a reactive model toward a preventive, risk-oriented approach supported by structured prediction systems. Various clinical risk assessment tools, including the hexagonal periodontal risk assessment (PRA), modified PRA (MPRA), UniFe/PerioRisk, SmartRisk, DentoRisk, and the Periodontal Risk Calculator (PRC/PreViser), have been designed to quantify and visualise an individual's susceptibility to disease progression. These models integrate multiple parameters such as probing depth, bleeding on probing, bone loss, smoking, diabetes, and host-response markers to generate patient- or tooth-level prognoses. Recent developments have incorporated artificial intelligence-driven algorithms and real-time digital data capture to enhance predictive accuracy and facilitate personalised maintenance strategies. This narrative review critically analyses the evolution, structure, validation evidence, and clinical applicability of major periodontal risk prediction systems and explores future directions for integrating biological, behavioral, and digital determinants to achieve precision periodontics."

This narrative review describes current uses of AI across major screening pathways. Prospective trials in mammography demonstrate non‑inferior cancer detection with large reductions in radiologist workload. In diabetic retinopathy, the first FDA‑authorized autonomous system extends specialist‑level screening into primary care and improves uptake. During colonoscopy, real‑time computer vision improves adenoma detection without increasing removal of non‑neoplastic tissue. Emerging multimodal approaches, including transformer‑based and large language model-enabled systems, integrate images, clinical variables, and molecular signals and underpin multi‑cancer early detection tests. Despite these gains, three constraints currently limit impact: the base‑rate problem in low‑prevalence cohorts, which magnifies the burden of false positives; limited generalizability and potential bias across institutions and populations; and practical barriers in workflow, regulation, and trust. Opportunities ahead include foundation models pre‑trained on diverse data, uncertainty‑aware ""decision referral,"" federated learning, larger representative datasets, and prospective trials that track interval cancers, stage shift, and cost‑effectiveness. The overarching conclusion is cautious optimism: when validated and invisibly integrated, AI augments physicians, expands access, and improves efficiency; realizing durable public‑health benefits will depend on equity‑focused design, rigorous evaluation, and sustained human oversight."

In this article, we focus on this practice, which is fully aligned with the NIH's Gold Standard Science (GSS) program as well as FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and TRUST (transparency, responsibility, user focus, sustainability, technology) principles. Gold Standard Science supports open science by emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and the use of best practices that enable others to verify and extend research. Pairing a research article's cited data snapshot with a versioned, environment-specific code release, deposited in a companion code repository, ensures that, upon submission to a medical journal, readers and reviewers can directly verify results. An executable and updatable companion code repository complements, rather than replaces, established research data repositories. When code underlying medical research results is made openly available, then other scientists can inspect, run, and validate analyses. These activities enhance reproducibility, which is a core aim of GSS. Shared code also facilitates collaborative innovation by allowing researchers to extend the utility of the code to new datasets and applications. For researchers, code sharing can increase visibility, credibility, and citation impact. Demonstrating transparency through shared executable and updatable code builds trust with journal readers, peer reviewers, funders, and peers. Shared code in an open access repository signals adherence to high standards of scientific integrity and attracts opportunities for collaboration. A researcher who shares code receives recognition as a leader in reproducible, trustworthy research consistent with NIH's GSS principles."

Traditional economic evaluation methods may not adequately capture the unique features of AI, including dynamic model evolution, scalability, and broader societal impacts. This systematic review synthesized existing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of AI-based healthcare interventions and assessed the methodological rigor of published studies. A comprehensive search identified health economic evaluations of AI applications published between September 2019 and March 2025, following PRISMA and SWiM guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42025641230). Eligible studies were full economic evaluations comparing AI-based interventions with non-AI alternatives, and data were extracted on study characteristics, analytical methods, decision-analytic models, perspectives, outcomes, and AI-specific costs. Methodological quality was evaluated using the CHEERS checklist. A total of 52 studies from 15 countries were included, most published after 2020, focusing on diabetic retinopathy screening, cancer detection, and cardiovascular disease applications. Cost-utility analysis was the predominant method (79%), followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (15%). Nearly all studies (98%) concluded that AI-based strategies were cost-effective, cost-beneficial, or cost-saving. However, reporting of AI-specific costs was inconsistent, while over 90% of studies detailed expenses such as software licensing, per-test charges, or maintenance fees, some omitted cost information entirely, limiting comparability. Overall, AI-based healthcare interventions are generally reported as cost-effective, but methodological heterogeneity, incomplete cost reporting, and potential publication bias constrain the reliability and comparability of current evidence. Standardized economic evaluation frameworks that incorporate comprehensive cost structures and account for the evolving nature of AI are urgently needed."

However, the shared molecular mechanisms linking T2DM and atherosclerosis have not been fully elucidated. We analyzed AS- and T2DM-related gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify overlapping differentially expressed genes and co-expression signatures. Functional enrichment (Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were then used to describe the pathways and interaction modules associated with these shared signatures, We next applied the cytoHubba algorithm together with several machine learning methods to prioritize hub genes and evaluate their diagnostic potential and combined CIBERSORT-based immune cell infiltration analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing data to examine cell types and the expression patterns of the shared genes in specific cell populations. We identified 72 shared feature genes. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes revealed significant enrichment of inflammatory- and metabolism-related pathways. Three genes-IL1B, MMP9, and P2RY13-emerged as shared hub genes and yielded robust ANN-based predictive performance across datasets. Immune deconvolution and single-cell analyses consistently indicated inflammatory amplification and an imbalance of macrophage polarization in both conditions. Biology mapped to the hubs suggests IL1B drives inflammatory signaling, MMP9 reflects extracellular-matrix remodeling, and P2RY13 implicates cholesterol transport. Collectively, these findings indicate that T2DM and AS converge on immune and inflammatory processes with macrophage dysregulation as a central axis; IL1B, MMP9, and P2RY13 represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets and may influence disease progression by regulating macrophage states, supporting translational application to diagnosis and treatment of T2DM-related atherosclerosis. These findings are preliminary. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm their validity, given the limitations of the present study."
