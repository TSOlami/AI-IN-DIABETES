Innumerable Machine Learning (…","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a health condition caused due to Diabetes Mellitus (DM). It causes vision problems and blindness due to disfigurement of human retina. According to statistics, 80% of diabetes patients battling from long diabetic period of 15 to 20 years, suffer from DR. Hence, it has become a dangerous threat to the health and life of people. To overcome DR, manual diagnosis of the disease is feasible but overwhelming and cumbersome at the same time and hence requires a revolutionary method. Thus, such a health condition necessitates primary recognition and diagnosis to prevent DR from developing into severe stages and prevent blindness. Innumerable Machine Learning (ML) models are proposed by researchers across the globe, to achieve this purpose. Various feature extraction techniques are proposed for extraction of DR features for early detection. However, traditional ML models have shown either meagre generalization throughout feature extraction and classification for deploying smaller datasets or consumes more of training time causing inefficiency in prediction while using larger datasets. Hence Deep Learning (DL), a new domain of ML, is introduced. DL models can handle a smaller dataset with help of efficient data processing techniques. However, they generally incorporate larger datasets for their deep architectures to enhance performance in feature extraction and image classification. This paper gives a detailed review on DR, its features, causes, ML models, state-of-the-art DL models, challenges, comparisons and future directions, for early detection of DR. "

Automated interpretation of retinal fundus photographs can help support and scale a robust screening program to detect DR. Objective To prospectively validate the performance of an automated DR system across 2 sites in India. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective observational study was conducted at 2 eye care centers in India (Aravind Eye Hospital and Sankara Nethralaya) and included 3049 patients with diabetes. Data collection and patient enrollment took place between April 2016 and July 2016 at Aravind and May 2016 and April 2017 at Sankara Nethralaya. The model was trained and fixed in March 2016. Interventions Automated DR grading system compared with manual grading by 1 trained grader and 1 retina specialist from each site. Adjudication by a panel of 3 retinal specialists served as the reference standard in the cases of disagreement. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity and specificity for moderate or worse DR or referable diabetic macula edema. Results Of 3049 patients, 1091 (35.8%) were women and the mean (SD) age for patients at Aravind and Sankara Nethralaya was 56.6 (9.0) years and 56.0 (10.0) years, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, the sensitivity and specificity for manual grading by individual nonadjudicator graders ranged from 73.4% to 89.8% and from 83.5% to 98.7%, respectively. The automated DR system’s performance was equal to or exceeded manual grading, with an 88.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 85.8-91.5), 92.2% specificity (95% CI, 90.3-93.8), and an area under the curve of 0.963 on the data set from Aravind Eye Hospital and 92.1% sensitivity (95% CI, 90.1-93.8), 95.2% specificity (95% CI, 94.2-96.1), and an area under the curve of 0.980 on the data set from Sankara Nethralaya. Conclusions and Relevance This study shows that the automated DR system generalizes to this population of Indian patients in a prospective setting and demonstrates the feasibility of using an automated DR grading system to expand screening programs."

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on color fundus images for the recognition task of diabetic retinopathy staging. Our network models achieved test metric performance comparable to baseline literature results, with validation sensitivity of 95%. We additionally explored multinomial classification models, and demonstrate that errors primarily occur in the misclassification of mild disease as normal due to the CNNs inability to detect subtle disease features. We discovered that preprocessing with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization and ensuring dataset fidelity by expert verification of class labels improves recognition of subtle features. Transfer learning on pretrained GoogLeNet and AlexNet models from ImageNet improved peak test set accuracies to 74.5%, 68.8%, and 57.2% on 2-ary, 3-ary, and 4-ary classification models, respectively."

Initially it is asymptomatic or causes fluctuating vision problems. As it becomes severe, it affects both the eyes and eventually causes partial or complete vision loss. Primarily occurs when the blood sugar level is unmanageable. Therefore, the person with diabetes mellitus is always at a high risk of acquiring this disease. The early detection can deter the contingency of complete and permanent blindness. Thus, requires an efficient screening system. The present work considers a deep learning methodology specifically a Densely Connected Convolutional Network DenseNet-169, which is applied for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy. It classifies the fundus images based on its severity levels as No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Proliferative DR. The datasets that are taken into consideration are Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 2015 and Aptos 2019 Blindness Detection which are both obtained from Kaggle. The proposed method is accomplished through various steps: Data Collection, Preprocessing, Augmentation and modelling. Our proposed model achieved 90% of accuracy. The Regression model was also employed, manifested up an accuracy of 78%. The main aim of this work is to develop a robust system for detecting DR automatically."

DR is the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults around the world and estimated it may affect more than 93 million people. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or controlled if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process, which requires an ophthalmologist or trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina, to identify DR by the presence of lesions associated with the vascular abnormalities caused by the disease.The automated method of DR screening will speed up the detection and decision-making process, which will help to control or manage DR progression. This paper presents an automated classification system, in which it analyzes fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view and generates a severity grade for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning models such as CNN, VGG-16 and VGG-19.This system achieves 80% sensitivity, 82% accuracy, 82% specificity, and 0.904 AUC for classifying images into 5 categories ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 is no DR and 4 is proliferative DR."

DR causes impaired vision and may even lead to blindness if it is not diagnosed in early stages. DR has five stages or classes, namely normal, mild, moderate, severe and PDR (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy). Normally, highly trained experts examine the colored fundus images to diagnose this fatal disease. This manual diagnosis of this condition (by clinicians) is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, various computer vision-based techniques have been proposed to automatically detect DR and its different stages from retina images. However, these methods are unable to encode the underlying complicated features and can only classify DR's different stages with very low accuracy particularly, for the early stages. In this research, we used the publicly available Kaggle dataset of retina images to train an ensemble of five deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models (Resnet50, Inceptionv3, Xception, Dense121, Dense169) to encode the rich features and improve the classification for different stages of DR. The experimental results show that the proposed model detects all the stages of DR unlike the current methods and performs better compared to state-of-the-art methods on the same Kaggle dataset."

One of the essential challenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success. Unfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is notoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images. Simplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of people. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself. However, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency between different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus. Additionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which makes use of similar datasets with different labeling. The presented method can be used as a screening method for early detection of diabetic retinopathy with sensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and is ranked 54 of 2943 competing methods (quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.925466) on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset (13000 images)."

The early detection of DR is crucial for effective treatment, as symptoms often manifest in later stages. The manual grading of retinal images is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks patient-friendliness. In this study, we propose two deep learning (DL) architectures, a hybrid network combining VGG16 and XGBoost Classifier, and the DenseNet 121 network, for DR detection and classification. To evaluate the two DL models, we preprocessed a collection of retinal images obtained from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Kaggle Dataset. This dataset exhibits an imbalanced image class distribution, which we addressed through appropriate balancing techniques. The performance of the considered models was assessed in terms of accuracy. The results showed that the hybrid network achieved an accuracy of 79.50%, while the DenseNet 121 model achieved an accuracy of 97.30%. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing methods utilizing the same dataset revealed the superior performance of the DenseNet 121 network. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of DL architectures for the early detection and classification of DR. The superior performance of the DenseNet 121 model highlights its effectiveness in this domain. The implementation of such automated methods can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of DR diagnosis, benefiting both healthcare providers and patients."

The primary goal is to automatically classify patients having diabetic retinopathy and not having the same, given any High-Resolution Fundus Image of the Retina. For that an initial image processing has been done on the images which includes mainly, conversion of coloured (RGB) images into perfect greyscale and resizing it. Then, a Deep Learning Approach is applied in which the processed image is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether the patient is diabetic or not. This methodology is applied on a dataset of 30 High Resolution Fundus Images of the retina. The results, so obtained are a 100 % predictive accuracy and a Sensitivity of 100 % also. Such an Automated System can easily classify images of the retina among Diabetic and Healthy patients, reducing the number of reviews of doctors."

Lack of effective treatment can lead to vision impairment and even irreversible blindness. The disease can be diagnosed by examining digital color fundus photographs of retina. In this paper we propose deep learning approach to automated diabetic retinopathy screening. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) — the most popular kind of deep learning algorithms — enjoyed great success in the field of image analysis and recognition. Therefore, we leverage CNN networks to diagnose the diabetic retinopathy and its current stage, based on analysis of the photographs of retina. The utilized models were trained using dataset containing over 88000 retina photographs, labeled by specialist clinicians. To enhance the performance of the system, we proposed a special class coding technique that enabled to include the information about value of difference between predicted score and target score into the objective function being minimized during the neural networks training. To evaluate classification ability of employed models we used standard accuracy metrics and quadratic weighted Kappa score that is calculated between the predicted scores and scores provided in the dataset. The best tested model achieved an accuracy of about 82% in detecting the retinopathy and 51% in assessing its stage. Moreover, system obtained decent Kappa score equal 0.776. Achieved results showed that deep learning algorithms can be successfully employed to solve this very hard to analyze problem."

The large population of diabetic patients and their massive screening requirements have generated interest in a computer-aided and fully automatic diagnosis of DR. Deep neural networks, on the other hand, have brought many breakthroughs in various tasks in the recent years. To automate the diagnosis of DR and provide appropriate suggestions to DR patients, we have built a dataset of DR fundus images that have been labeled by the proper treatment method that is required. Using this dataset, we trained deep convolutional neural network models to grade the severities of DR fundus images. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 88.72% for a four-degree classification task in the experiments. We deployed our models on a cloud computing platform and provided pilot DR diagnostic services for several hospitals; in the clinical evaluation, the system achieved a consistency rate of 91.8% with ophthalmologists, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work."
