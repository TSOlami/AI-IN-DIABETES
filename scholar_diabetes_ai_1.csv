Early prediction and personalized management are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This study presents a novel approach leveraging deep learning techniques and multi-modal data analysis for the early prediction and personalized management of T2DM. We developed a deep learning model that integrates diverse data types, including electronic health records, genetic information, lifestyle data, and continuous glucose monitoring. The model was trained on a large dataset of 50,000 patients, including both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, with a 5-year follow-up period. Our results demonstrate that the deep learning model achieves a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 92% in predicting T2DM onset up to 3 years before clinical diagnosis, outperforming traditional risk assessment tools. Furthermore, the model generates personalized management plans, including tailored lifestyle recommendations and medication schedules, which led to a 25% improvement in glycemic control compared to standard care in a randomized controlled trial of 1,000 patients. This study highlights the potential of AI-driven, multi-modal approaches in revolutionizing diabetes care. By enabling earlier interventions and more personalized management strategies, this approach could significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of T2DM on healthcare systems. Future work will focus on external validation, long-term follow-up studies, and integration into clinical workflows."

This approach combines deep learning techniques with medical data fusion to integrate retinal images with important measurements such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and diabetes duration. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for high-level image analysis and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to process medical data, and achieves fusion through integration. Compared with image-only models, this principle improves performance metrics including optimization, recall, and classification accuracy. Through the use of visualization and therapy, this approach provides large-scale and flexible solutions for many clinical environments. This study demonstrates the various aspects of multidisciplinary work in the diagnosis of DR, paving the way for better patient outcomes and setting a new standard for integration into expert clinical practice in medicine. Future work will focus on expanding the data, developing the translational model and exploring real-world applications."

Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions. This review highlights current developments and outlines future directions to support the design of scalable, generalizable, and clinically applicable multimodal DL systems for DR detection. "

The development dataset was from DRCR Retina Network clinical trials, external testing dataset 1 was from the Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore, and external testing dataset 2 was from the Eye Clinic, IRCCS MultiMedica, Milan, Italy. AI models were trained to detect CI-DME, visual impairment (BCVA 20/32 or worse), and CI-DME with visual impairment, using CFPs alone, OCTs alone, and both CFPs and OCTs together (multimodal). Data from 1,007 eyes were used to train and validate the algorithms, and data from 448 eyes were used for testing. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. In the primary testing set, the CFP model, OCT model, and multimodal model had AUCs of 0.848 (95% CI 0.787-0.900), 0.913 (95% CI 0.870-0.947), and 0.939 (95% CI 0.906-0.964), respectively, for detection of CI-DME with visual impairment. In external testing dataset 1, the CFP, OCT, and multimodal models had AUCs of 0.756 (95% CI 0.624-0.870), 0.949 (95% CI 0.889-0.989), and 0.917 (95% CI 0.837-0.979), respectively, for detection of CI-DME with visual impairment. In external testing dataset 2, the CFP, OCT, and multimodal models had AUCs of 0.881 (95% CI 0.822-0.940), 0.828 (95% CI 0.749-0.905), and 0.907 (95% CI 0.852-0.952), respectively, for detection of CI-DME with visual impairment. The AI models showed good diagnostic performance for detection of CI-DME with visual impairment. The multimodal (CFP and OCT) model did not offer additional benefit over the OCT model alone. If validated in prospective studies, these AI models could potentially help to improve triage and detection of patients who require prompt treatment. "

An ophthalmologist or an automated system can identify DR through manual examination. The automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy has become a preferred choice for patients and healthcare providers due to its cost-effectiveness and time efficiency. The novelty of this research lies in developing a model for predicting diabetic retinopathy using multimodal data fusion, incorporating fundus retinal images, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electronic health records (EHR) through an early fusion technique implemented in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Our model, which utilizes an early fusion of multimodal data with Local Binary Pattern (LBP), has demonstrated the best performance, achieving an AUC value of 0.99. This high accuracy indicates that integrating information from various data sources can significantly improve the capability of the model in detecting both positive and negative cases of diabetic retinopathy, instilling confidence in the reliability of our findings."

However, accurate diagnosis depends on multimodal imaging and the expertise of retinal ophthalmologists.
Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model to detect treatment-requiring retinal vascular diseases using multimodal imaging.
Methods: This retrospective study enrolled participants with multimodal ophthalmic imaging data from 3 hospitals in Taiwan from 2013 to 2019. Eye-related images were used, including those obtained through retinal fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography with or without indocyanine green angiography (FA/ICGA). A deep learning model was constructed for detecting DME, nAMD, mCNV, BRVO, and CRVO and identifying treatment-requiring diseases. Model performance was evaluated and is presented as the area under the curve (AUC) for each receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: A total of 2992 eyes of 2185 patients were studied, with 239, 1209, 1008, 211, 189, and 136 eyes in the control, DME, nAMD, mCNV, BRVO, and CRVO groups, respectively. Among them, 1898 eyes required treatment. The eyes were divided into training, validation, and testing groups in a 5:1:1 ratio. In total, 5117 retinal fundus photos, 9316 OCT images, and 20,922 FA/ICGA images were used. The AUCs for detecting mCNV, DME, nAMD, BRVO, and CRVO were 0.996, 0.995, 0.990, 0.959, and 0.988, respectively. The AUC for detecting treatment-requiring diseases was 0.969. From the heat maps, we observed that the model could identify retinal vascular diseases.
Conclusions: Our study developed a deep learning model to detect retinal diseases using multimodal ophthalmic imaging. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good performance in detecting treatment-requiring retinal diseases."

Methods We used 26,699 fundus images of 17,834 diabetic patients from three Taiwanese hospitals collected in 2007 to 2018 for DR severity classification. Thirty-seven ophthalmologists verified the images using lesion annotation and severity classification as the ground truth. Two deep learning fusion architectures were proposed: late fusion, which combines lesion and severity classification models in parallel using a postprocessing procedure, and two-stage early fusion, which combines lesion detection and classification models sequentially and mimics the decision-making process of ophthalmologists. Messidor-2 was used with 1748 images to evaluate and benchmark the performance of the architecture. The primary evaluation metrics were classification accuracy, weighted κ statistic, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results For hospital data, a hybrid architecture achieved a good detection rate, with accuracy and weighted κ of 84.29% and 84.01%, respectively, for five-class DR grading. It also classified the images of early stage DR more accurately than conventional algorithms. The Messidor-2 model achieved an AUC of 97.09% in referral DR detection compared to AUC of 85% to 99% for state-of-the-art algorithms that learned from a larger database. Conclusions Our hybrid architectures strengthened and extracted characteristics from DR images, while improving the performance of DR grading, thereby increasing the robustness and confidence of the architectures for general use. Translational Relevance The proposed fusion architectures can enable faster and more accurate diagnosis of various DR pathologies than that obtained in current manual clinical practice."

Design Cross-sectional analysis of a retinal image data set from a previous prospective OCT angiography (OCTA) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03422965). Participants Patients with T1DM included in the progenitor study. Methods Radiomic features were extracted from color fundus photographs (CFPs), OCT, and OCTA images, and ML models were trained using these features either individually or combined with clinical data (demographics and systemic data, OCT + OCTA commercial software metrics, ocular data, blood data). Different data combinations were tested to determine the CV risk stages, defined according to international classifications. Main Outcome Measures Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve mean and standard deviation for each ML model and each data combination. Results A data set of 597 eyes (359 individuals) was analyzed. Models trained only with the radiomic features achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of (0.79 ± 0.03) to identify moderate risk cases from high and very high-risk cases, and (0.73 ± 0.07) for distinguishing between high and very high-risk cases. The addition of clinical variables improved all AUC values, obtaining (0.99 ± 0.01) for identifying moderate cases, and (0.95 ± 0.02) for differentiating between high and very high-risk cases. For very high CV risk, radiomics combined with OCT + OCTA metrics and ocular data achieved an AUC of (0.89 ± 0.02) without systemic data input. The performance of the models was similar in unilateral and bilateral eye image data sets. Conclusions Radiomic features obtained from retinal images are helpful to discriminate and classify CV risk labels, differentiating risk categories. The addition of demographics and systemic data combined with ocular data differentiate high from very high CV risk cases, and interestingly OCT + OCTA metrics with ocular data identify very high CV risk cases without systemic data input. These results reflect the potential of this oculomics approach for CV risk assessment.
