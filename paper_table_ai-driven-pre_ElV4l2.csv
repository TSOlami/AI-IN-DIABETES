Screening for DR is recommended in children and adolescents, but adherence is poor. Recently, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed for early detection of DR and have been included in the American Diabetes Association’s guidelines for screening in adults. We sought to determine the diagnostic efficacy of autonomous AI for the diabetic eye exam in youth with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this prospective study, point-of-care diabetic eye exam was implemented using a nonmydriatic fundus camera with an autonomous AI system for detection of DR in a multidisciplinary pediatric diabetes center. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosability of AI was compared with consensus grading by retinal specialists, who were masked to AI output. Adherence to screening guidelines was measured before and after AI implementation. RESULTS Three hundred ten youth with diabetes aged 5–21 years were included, of whom 4.2% had DR. Diagnosability of AI was 97.5% (302 of 310). The sensitivity and specificity of AI to detect more-than-mild DR was 85.7% (95% CI 42.1–99.6%) and 79.3% (74.3–83.8%), respectively, compared with the reference standard as defined by retina specialists. Adherence improved from 49% to 95% after AI implementation. CONCLUSIONS Use of a nonmydriatic fundus camera with autonomous AI was safe and effective for the diabetic eye exam in youth in our study. Adherence to screening guidelines improved with AI implementation. As the prevalence of diabetes increases in youth and adherence to screening guidelines remains suboptimal, effective strategies for diabetic eye exams in this population are needed.","In this article, a point-of-care diabetic eye exam was implemented using a nonmydriatic fundus camera with an autonomous artificial intelligence system for detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a multidisciplinary pediatric diabetes center."

Early detection and treatment of DR is critical for saving vision and preventing blindness. To address the need for increased DR detection and referrals, we evaluated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for screening DR. Methods: Patient images were obtained using a 45-degree Canon Non-Mydriatic CR-2 Plus AF retinal camera in the Department of Endocrinology Clinic (Newark, NJ) and in a community screening event (Newark, NJ). Images were initially classified by an on-site grader and uploaded for analysis by EyeArt, a cloud-based AI software developed by Eyenuk (California, USA). The images were also graded by an off-site retina specialist. Using Fleiss kappa analysis, a correlation was investigated between the three grading systems, the AI, onsite grader, and a US board-certified retina specialist, for a diagnosis of DR and referral pattern. Results: The EyeArt results, onsite grader, and the retina specialist had a 79% overall agreement on the diagnosis of DR. The kappa value for concordance on a diagnosis was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61-0.77), indicating substantial agreement. Referral patterns by EyeArt, the onsite grader, and the ophthalmologist had an 85% overall agreement.

Despite many improvements in diabetic care, DM remains a leading cause of visual impairment in working-age patients. So far, prevention has been the best way to protect vision. The sooner we diagnose DED, the more effective the treatment is. Thus, diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, especially with imaging techniques, is a method of choice for vision protection. To alleviate the burden of diabetic patients who need ophthalmic care, telemedicine and in-home testing are used, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This is why we decided to evaluate current image teleophthalmology methods used for DR screening. We searched the PubMed platform for papers published over the last 5 years (2015–2020) using the following key words: telemedicine in diabetic retinopathy screening, diabetic retinopathy screening, automated diabetic retinopathy screening, artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy screening, smartphone diabetic retinopathy testing. We have included 118 original articles meeting the above criteria, discussing imaging diabetic retinopathy screening methods. We have found that fundus cameras, stable or mobile, are most commonly used for retinal photography, with portable fundus cameras also relatively common. Other possibilities involve the use of ultra-wide-field (UWF) imaging and even optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices for DR screening. Also, the role of smartphones is increasingly recognized in the field. Retinal fundus images are assessed by humans instantly or remotely, while AI algorithms seem to be useful tools facilitating retinal image assessment. The common use of smartphones and availability of relatively cheap, easy-to-use adapters for retinal photographs augmented by AI algorithms make it possible for eye fundus photographs to be taken by non-specialists and in non-medical setting. This opens the way for in-home testing conducted on a much larger scale in the future. In conclusion, based on current DR screening techniques, we can suggest that the future practice of eye care specialists will be widely supported by AI algorithms, and this way will be more effective.","In this article, the authors evaluate current image teleophthalmology methods used for diabetic retinopathy screening and suggest that the future practice of eye care specialists will be widely supported by AI algorithms, and this way will be more effective."

Because of this, medical practitioners may be able to intervene early on, when the illness is most amenable to treatment systems that can monitor blood glucose levels and examine patient histories to create customized diabetic treatment programs. This can involve individualized prescription schedules, workout programs, and food advice. All things considered, AI has the power to completely transform the way people with diabetes are managed by giving patients and healthcare providers individualized data-driven insights. The use of AI in clinical practice is fraught with difficulties, such as privacy issues and a dearth of standardized data, yet the advantages in identifying and treating diabetes are substantial.","Artificial intelligence has the power to completely transform the way people with diabetes are managed by giving patients and healthcare providers individualized data-driven insights, yet the advantages in identifying and treating diabetes are substantial."

Overall, 26% of the 37 million Americans with diabetes suffer from DR, and 5% of people with diabetes suffer from vision-threatening DR. DR is a heterogeneous disease; thus, it is essential to acknowledge this diversity as we advance toward precision medicine. The current classification for DR primarily focuses on the microvascular component of disease progression, which does not fully capture the heterogeneity of disease etiology in different patients. Further, researchers in the field have suggested renewed interest in improving diagnosis and treatment modalities for personalized care in DR management. Moreover, genetic factors, lifestyle, and environmental variation strongly affect the disease outcome. It is important to emphasize that various ocular and peripheral biomarkers, along with imaging techniques, significantly influence the diagnosis of DR. Therefore, in this review, we explore the heterogeneity of DR, genetic variations or polymorphism, lifestyle and environmental factors, and how these factors may affect the development of precision medicine for DR. First, we provide a rationale for the necessity of a multifaceted understanding of disease etiology. Next, we discuss different aspects of DR diagnosis, emphasizing the need for further stratification of patient populations to facilitate personalized treatment. We then discuss different genetics, race, sex, lifestyle, and environmental factors that could help personalize treatments for DR.

Amir Hayeri","10.2196/18660","","Background: Diabetes mellitus, which causes dysregulation of blood glucose in humans, is a major public health challenge. Patients with diabetes must monitor their glycemic levels to keep them in a healthy range. This task is made easier by using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and relaying their output to smartphone apps, thus providing users with real-time information on their glycemic fluctuations and possibly predicting future trends.
Objective: This study aims to discuss various challenges of predictive monitoring of glycemia and examines the accuracy and blood glucose control effects of Diabits, a smartphone app that helps patients with diabetes monitor and manage their blood glucose levels in real time.
Methods: Using data from CGM devices and user input, Diabits applies machine learning techniques to create personalized patient models and predict blood glucose fluctuations up to 60 min in advance. These predictions give patients an opportunity to take pre-emptive action to maintain their blood glucose values within the reference range. In this retrospective observational cohort study, the predictive accuracy of Diabits and the correlation between daily use of the app and blood glucose control metrics were examined based on real app users’ data. Moreover, the accuracy of predictions on the 2018 Ohio T1DM (type 1 diabetes mellitus) data set was calculated and compared against other published results.
Results: On the basis of more than 6.8 million data points, 30-min Diabits predictions evaluated using Parkes Error Grid were found to be 86.89% (5,963,930/6,864,130) clinically accurate (zone A) and 99.56% (6,833,625/6,864,130) clinically acceptable (zones A and B), whereas 60-min predictions were 70.56% (4,843,605/6,864,130) clinically accurate and 97.49% (6,692,165/6,864,130) clinically acceptable. By analyzing daily use statistics and CGM data for the 280 most long-standing users of Diabits, it was established that under free-living conditions, many common blood glucose control metrics improved with increased frequency of app use. For instance, the average blood glucose for the days these users did not interact with the app was 154.0 (SD 47.2) mg/dL, with 67.52% of the time spent in the healthy 70 to 180 mg/dL range. For days with 10 or more Diabits sessions, the average blood glucose decreased to 141.6 (SD 42.0) mg/dL (P<.001), whereas the time in euglycemic range increased to 74.28% (P<.001). On the Ohio T1DM data set of 6 patients with type 1 diabetes, 30-min predictions of the base Diabits model had an average root mean square error of 18.68 (SD 2.19) mg/dL, which is an improvement over the published state-of-the-art results for this data set.
Conclusions: Diabits accurately predicts future glycemic fluctuations, potentially making it easier for patients with diabetes to maintain their blood glucose in the reference range. Furthermore, an improvement in glucose control was observed on days with more frequent Diabits use.

Digital health care interventions (DHIs) can provide scalable care, fostering diabetes self-management and reducing the risk of complications. Tailorability (providing personalized interventions) and usability are key to DHI engagement/effectiveness. User-centered design of DHIs (aligning features to end users’ needs) can generate more usable interventions, avoiding unintended consequences and improving user engagement. OBJECTIVE MyDiabetesIQ (MDIQ) is an artificial intelligence engine intended to predict users’ diabetes complications risk. It will underpin a user interface in which users will alter lifestyle parameters to see the impact on their future risks. MDIQ will link to an existing DHI, My Diabetes My Way (MDMW). We describe the user-centered design of the user interface of MDIQ as informed by human factors engineering. METHODS Current users of MDMW were invited to take part in focus groups to gather their insights about users being shown their likelihood of developing diabetes-related complications and any risks they perceived from using MDIQ. Findings from focus groups informed the development of a prototype MDIQ interface, which was then user-tested through the “think aloud” method, in which users speak aloud about their thoughts/impressions while performing prescribed tasks. Focus group and think aloud transcripts were analyzed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive analysis. For think aloud data, a sociotechnical model was used as a framework for thematic analysis. RESULTS Focus group participants (n=8) felt that some users could become anxious when shown their future complications risks. They highlighted the importance of easy navigation, jargon avoidance, and the use of positive/encouraging language. User testing of the prototype site through think aloud sessions (n=7) highlighted several usability issues. Issues included confusing visual cues and confusion over whether user-updated information fed back to health care teams. Some issues could be compounded for users with limited digital skills. Results from the focus groups and think aloud workshops were used in the development of a live MDIQ platform. CONCLUSIONS Acting on the input of end users at each iterative stage of a digital tool’s development can help to prioritize users throughout the design process, ensuring the alignment of DHI features with user needs. The use of the sociotechnical framework encouraged the consideration of interactions between different sociotechnical dimensions in finding solutions to issues, for example, avoiding the exclusion of users with limited digital skills. Based on user feedback, the tool could scaffold good goal setting, allowing users to balance their palatable future complications risk against acceptable lifestyle changes. Optimal control of diabetes relies heavily on self-management. Tools such as MDMW/ MDIQ can offer personalized support for self-management alongside access to users’ electronic health records, potentially helping to delay or reduce long-term complications, thereby providing significant reductions in health care costs.","This study designs a user-centered risk prediction tool, MyDiabetesIQ, using artificial intelligence to predict diabetes complications, incorporating user feedback to ensure usability and tailorability, ultimately aiming to improve diabetes self-management and reduce healthcare costs."

Type 1 DM (DM1) constitutes the insulin-dependent manifestation from disease onset. Effective DM1 management necessitates daily blood glucose monitoring, pattern recognition, and cognitive prediction of future glycemic levels to ascertain the requisite exogenous insulin dosage. Nevertheless, this methodology may prove imprecise and perilous. The advent of groundbreaking developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), encompassing Big Data, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning algorithms (ML), has facilitated continuous DM1 management monitoring. This investigation concentrates on IoMT-based methodologies for the unbroken observation of DM1 management, thereby enabling comprehensive characterization of diabetic individuals. Integrating machine learning techniques with wearable technology may yield dependable models for forecasting short-term blood glucose concentrations. The objective of this research is to devise precise person-specific short-term prediction models, utilizing an array of features. To accomplish this, inventive modeling strategies were employed on an extensive dataset comprising glycaemia-related biological attributes gathered from a large-scale passive monitoring initiative involving 40 DM1 patients. The models produced via the Random Forest approach can predict glucose levels within a 30-minute horizon with an average error of 18.60 mg/dL for six-hour data, and 26.21 mg/dL for a 45-minute prediction horizon. These findings have also been corroborated with data from 10 Type 2 DM patients as a proof of concept, thereby demonstrating the potential of IoMT-based methodologies for continuous DM monitoring and management. The integration of innovative biological signal sensors and the application of transformative trends in ICT can offer a novel perspective on DM treatment, ensuring precise and secure glucose level management. ","This study develops IoMT-based predictive models using wearable data to forecast short-term blood glucose concentrations in Type 1 and 2 diabetes patients, achieving average errors of 18.60 mg/dL and 26.21 mg/dL, respectively, with potential for continuous DM monitoring and management."

The growth in the capabilities of telehealth have made it possible to identify individuals with a higher risk of uncontrolled diabetes and provide them with targeted support and resources to help them manage their condition. Thus, predictive modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for the advancement of diabetes management.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to conceptualize and develop a novel machine learning (ML) approach to proactively identify participants enrolled in a remote diabetes monitoring program (RDMP) who were at risk of uncontrolled diabetes at 12 months in the program.


METHODS
Registry data from the Livongo for Diabetes RDMP were used to design separate dynamic predictive ML models to predict participant outcomes at each monthly checkpoint of the participants' program journey (month-n models) from the first day of onboarding (month-0 model) up to the 11th month (month-11 model). A participant's program journey began upon onboarding into the RDMP and monitoring their own blood glucose (BG) levels through the RDMP-provided BG meter. Each participant passed through 12 predicative models through their first year enrolled in the RDMP. Four categories of participant attributes (ie, survey data, BG data, medication fills, and health signals) were used for feature construction. The models were trained using the light gradient boosting machine and underwent hyperparameter tuning. The performance of the models was evaluated using standard metrics, including precision, recall, specificity, the area under the curve, the F1-score, and accuracy.


RESULTS
The ML models exhibited strong performance, accurately identifying observable at-risk participants, with recall ranging from 70% to 94% and precision from 40% to 88% across the 12-month program journey. Unobservable at-risk participants also showed promising performance, with recall ranging from 61% to 82% and precision from 42% to 61%. Overall, model performance improved as participants progressed through their program journey, demonstrating the importance of engagement data in predicting long-term clinical outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
This study explored the Livongo for Diabetes RDMP participants' temporal and static attributes, identification of diabetes management patterns and characteristics, and their relationship to predict diabetes management outcomes. Proactive targeting ML models accurately identified participants at risk of uncontrolled diabetes with a high level of precision that was generalizable through future years within the RDMP. The ability to identify participants who are at risk at various time points throughout the program journey allows for personalized interventions to improve outcomes. This approach offers significant advancements in the feasibility of large-scale implementation in remote monitoring programs and can help prevent uncontrolled glycemic levels and diabetes-related complications.

We also designed a non-invasive blood sugar sensor using a near-infrared (NIR) sensor. The proposed system can predict the patient’s health condition, which is evaluated by a set of machine learning algorithms with the support of a fuzzy logic decision-making system. The designed system was validated on a large data set of 50 diabetes patients. The results of the simulation manifest that the random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy in comparison to other machine learning algorithms. The system predicts the patient’s condition accurately and sends it to the doctor’s portal.","A smart sensing technologies-based architecture is proposed that uses AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) for continuous monitoring and health assistance for diabetes patients and the results of the simulation manifest that the random forest classifier gives the highest accuracy in comparison to other machine learning algorithms."

Diabetic microvascular complications significantly impact morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) in predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN).


METHODS
A comprehensive PubMed search from 1990 to 2023 identified studies on ML/AI models for diabetic microvascular complications. The review analyzed study design, cohorts, predictors, ML techniques, prediction horizon, and performance metrics.


RESULTS
Among the 74 identified studies, 256 featured internally validated ML models and 124 had externally validated models, with about half being retrospective. Since 2010, there has been a rise in the use of ML for predicting microvascular complications, mainly driven by DKD research across 27 countries. A more modest increase in ML research on DR and DN was observed, with publications from fewer countries. For all microvascular complications, predictive models achieved a mean (standard deviation) c-statistic of 0.79 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.72 (0.12) on external validation. Diabetic kidney disease models had the highest discrimination, with c-statistics of 0.81 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.74 (0.13) on external validation, respectively. Few studies externally validated prediction of DN. The prediction horizon, outcome definitions, number and type of predictors, and ML technique significantly influenced model performance.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
There is growing global interest in using ML for predicting diabetic microvascular complications. Research on DKD is the most advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance. Both DR and DN require more research. External validation and adherence to recommended guidelines are crucial.","There is growing global interest in using ML for predicting diabetic microvascular complications, and research on DKD is the most advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance."
