 Artificial intelligence (AI), a technology reshaping healthcare, is used to investigate, gather data and draw conclusions from electronic medical records and imaging procedures. AI has been shown to aid in identifying, categorizing, diagnosing, and managing diabetic mellitus . It will likely continue to do so with a clear understanding and the ability to find previously unidentified solutions . AI has a role in diabetes helping to anticipate the diagnosis, provide nutrition and exercise goals, monitor complications, and assist with self-management . We may now see the management of diabetes and other chronic diseases from a new viewpoint thanks to the expanded use of continuous glucose monitoring and the identification of patterns in glucose fluctuation known as glucose variability . It has paved the way for in-depth research into the many new factors that affect managing diabetes such as socio-economic factors, sleep, and activity . Redefining Diabetes Care:
 With electronic medical data, artificial intelligence has allowed us to shape and address the necessary preventive treatment by understanding and predicting people at high risk of acquiring diabetes . The classification and accurate prediction of diabetes in an individual may change soon with the thorough Editorial densities. A non-invasive method of anticipating and diagnosing the illness is now possible thanks to more precise and defined imaging advancements . Recently there has been use of more CT, MRI imaging modalities are being used more when compared to traditional imaging modalities as it is able to provide more enhanced images showing more detail of metabolic function and coronary anatomy by using imaging like MR spectroscopy, 3D intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography . Conclusion::
 AI is being used as a therapeutic and instructional tool that is and will revolutionize how diseases are managed for years to come. Machine learning is a tool that carries strategic weightage by carrying detailed analytical data in different forms in addition to clinical care that has been revolutionary in the incorporation of precision medicine, whether with CGMS discovery and implementation or through advancements in imaging modalities to screen, manage complications of diabetes. Conclusion::
 To lessen diabetes disease burden and aid in reducing morbidity associated with diabetes, AI use has integrated diagnostic and therapeutic roles with use of thorough analysis and algorithms that only increase the accuracy of management in diabetes care while also filling in the gaps that were missed previously. Focusing on precision medicine practice and treatment has tailored new innovative treatment goals towards individuals' particular data and surveillance. It is inclined to focus on collaborative efforts that have proven incredibly strategic and is an advancement to medical practices that is taking precedence. Artificial intelligence is transforming how diabetes is understood and managed by way of making new analysis that has paved the way to new focus of precision medicine care. examination of multiple glucose levels and analysis of CGM readings . Predicting prediabetes and diabetes at an earlier stage in more patients using strict glycemic trends, risk factors, and focusing on adapting precision therapy may become a reality in primary care settings ."
"Medical AI and Contextual Bias","https://scispace.com/paper/medical-ai-and-contextual-bias-4fyt7p7ts5","2019","Posted Content","Social Science Research Network","Price
W. Nicholson","","https://scispace.com/pdf/medical-ai-and-contextual-bias-4fyt7p7ts5.pdf","Artificial intelligence will transform medicine. One particularly attractive possibility is the democratization of medical expertise. If black-box medical algorithms can be trained to match the performance of high-level human experts — to identify malignancies as well as trained radiologists, to diagnose diabetic retinopathy as well as board-certified ophthalmologists, or to recommend tumor-specific courses of treatment as well as top-ranked oncologists — then those algorithms could be deployed in medical settings where human experts are not available, and patients could benefit. 

But there is a problem with this vision. Privacy law, malpractice, insurance reimbursement, and FDA approval standards all encourage developers to train medical AI in high-resource contexts, such as academic medical centers. And put simply, care is different in high-resource settings than it is in low-resource settings such as community health centers or rural providers in less-developed countries. Patient populations differ, as do the resources available to administer treatment and the resources available to pay for that treatment. This development pattern will lead to decreases in the quality of the algorithm’s recommendations, reflected in problematic care and increased costs. Perniciously, such quality problems in low-resource contexts are likely to go unrecognized for exactly the same reasons that promote algorithmic training in high-resource contexts.

Solutions are not trivial. Labeling products the same way that drugs are labeled is unlikely to work, and truly addressing the problem may require a combination of public investment in data to train medical AI and regulatory requirements for cross-context validation. Nevertheless, if black-box medicine is to achieve its goal of bringing excellent medicine to broad sets of patients, the problem of contextual bias should be recognized and addressed sooner rather than later.","improve privacy as details are read by machines rather than medical scribes. B. Automating the Routine: (finding that physicians ""logged an average of 3.08 hours on office visits and 3.17 hours on desktop medicine each day""). C. Democratizing Expertise:
 Finally, medical AI promises to democratize medical expertise. Today, there are tremendous differences in the quality and level of care patients receive based on the context in which they receive that care.  This is reflected in everything from the availability of a specialist (e.g., whether a patient can see a board-certified ophthalmologist or dermatologist rather than relying on a primary care physician for more complex care) to the type of practitioner involved (e.g., physician versus nurse practitioner) to the qualifications of the provider (e.g., top-of-her-class with elite fellowships to less-exalted qualifications).  Medical AI promises to reduce this variation by ""leveling up""allowing a much broader swath of providers to provide care at the level of excellent specialists, which is what I mean by democratization of medical expertise. Medical AI is scalable in a way that human expertise simply is not; although gathering data, training algorithms, and validating algorithmic performance are all hard and expensive tasks, 30 duplicating an existing algorithm for use in another setting is much easier and cheaper than training new people for the same tasks. 31 It's not free or easyinformation infrastructure still needs to be set up,  and the data the algorithm will analyze need to be properly collected and formatted on-site 33but an algorithm is easier to copy than an oncologist. C. Democratizing Expertise:
 This Section describes how AI can democratize different types of medical expertise. It then considers where AI can bring expertisea span that ranges from other high-resource settings like mid-level hos- 31. Such duplication is not costless, of course, and in some situations doing the transfer right might actually be more expensive than home-growing a solution. See, e.g., JAMES E. TCHENG ET AL., NAT'L ACAD. OF MED., OPTIMIZING STRATEGIES FOR CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT: SUMMARY OF A MEETING SERIES 28 (2017) (""While the creation of CDS [clinical decision support] content in-house is an expensive and resource-intensive endeavor, sharing CDS content, either with peers or through the licensing of vendor content, is presently perceived to be equally or more expensive; thus this duplication of effort at each site has persisted.""). 33. Further down the road, AI can help here too; natural language processing will make it easier to accept unstructured data about patients rather than requiring data to be in a certain format. See supra Section II.B. pitals to very low-resource settings like rural providers in lessdeveloped countries. Diagnostics and Treatment Recommendations:
 AI can democratize different types of medical expertise. Though medical expertise comes in many flavors, with many interconnections, we can usefully consider two rough classes: diagnostics and treatment recommendations."

 Progress in AI for improving screening and detection of diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and foot ulcers can transform the gaps in clinical care. The cost of screening and limitation on human and equipment resources is still challenging despite adoption of telemedicine especially in developing countries. The early detection of complications can protect patients from dangerous stages that may later cause blindness and foot amputations.

 Unlocking the Potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Healthcare DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.111489 Patient engagement:
 Improving patient engagement and self-management through immersive technology, virtual coaching, and educational programs can shift disease courses to better outcomes. Face-to-face educational programs are followed in less than 10% of newly diagnosed people, but the emergence of digital health has given them the opportunity to overcome the challenges of lower engagement and participation from patients . A statewide survey study in Indianapolis found that about 50% of people use technology to communicate with providers . Telemedicine, via various telehealth portals, is now accepted as the necessary new normal and is expected to grow by 33% from 2019 to 2026 thus reaching $ 185.6 billion by 2026 . Patients involved in their healthcare will experience better long-term health outcomes and incur lower costs, so there is a push toward promoting greater patient engagement. Challenges in AI of diabetic care:
 Though there are many diabetic AI apps and devices everywhere, however, there has been a lower uptake in the long-term engagement of digital health technologies . Even with a slower understanding of technologies, digital data collected from diabetic patients is growing exponentially. Data is the key to creating better AI insights, but it can be very easy to get exhausted by big data. Besides, data collected by wearables has constraints around their integration into existing systems. It also raises concerns about data privacy, security, and even legal hurdles. Challenges in AI of diabetic care:
 Our ambition should be to create comprehensive and relevant solutions to enhance the usability of AI-based tools with evidence-based models in collaboration with all stakeholders including patients. Effectiveness will depend on the rapidity of construction and modification of new apps, devices, and sensors according to improve diabetes experience for patients and organizational needs. The resolution of such challenges will depend on adequate scientific research and regulation. Conclusion:
 In conclusion, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare management and provide tremendous benefits to healthcare organizations and patients alike. AI can help healthcare organizations gain insights into data that would otherwise be difficult to obtain, provide real-time decision support and recommendations, automate mundane tasks, improve diagnosis and treatment accuracy, monitor patient health, predict future health outcomes, and improve communication between healthcare professionals and patients. As AI continues to advance, healthcare organizations must take advantage of its many benefits and integrate the technology into their systems to ensure they are staying competitive in an ever-changing healthcare landscape."

The discovery of insulin in 1921 transformed the landscape of diabetes treatment and was followed by the discovery of several new therapies which improved glycemia and increased patient life span. However, as patients with diabetes lived longer, they developed classic microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications. In the 1990s, the DCCT and the UKPDS trials demonstrated that tight glucose control reduced the microvascular complications of diabetes, but had marginal effects on cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. In 2008, the FDA directed that all new diabetes medications demonstrate cardiovascular safety. From this recommendation emerged novel therapeutic classes, the GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2-Inhibitors, which not only improve glycemia, but also provide robust cardio-renal protection. In parallel, developments in diabetes technology like continuous glucose monitoring systems, insulin pumps, telemedicine and precision medicine have advanced diabetes management. Remarkably, a century later, insulin remains a cornerstone of diabetes treatment. Also, diet and physical activity remain important components of any diabetes treatment. Today type 2 diabetes is preventable and long-term remission of diabetes is possible. Finally, progress continues in the field of islet transplantation, perhaps the ultimate frontier in diabetes management. ","type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). With ongoing improvements in scanning technology and tubeless insulin pods, the cost of CGMS and insulin pumps has decreased and may become available at a reasonable cost for patients with T2DM as well. Advances in Glucose Monitoring:
 The goal in this field is to develop long term, implantable glucose sensors and fully automated insulin delivery systems which use artificial intelligence to seamlessly maintain glucose in the normal range without the need for human intervention  . Together with diabetes technology and telemedicine, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly coming of age and may soon present a paradigm shift in diabetic management through data-driven precision care. AI supports the development of predictive models that can be implemented at the individual level to refine glycemic control, or at population level to estimate the risk of diabetes and its related complications across diverse patient groups  . The Advent of Telemedicine:
 Telemedicine can be useful for the management of diabetes mellitus and can also be costeffective  . Remote monitoring of glucose levels improves A1C levels in people with poor glucose control. When multiple daily injections of insulin are required, continuous glucose monitoring improves glycemic control and increases patient satisfaction  . Until recently, the use of telemedicine has been minimal. However, social-distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a rapid acceleration of telemedicine, allowing providers to interact with patients virtually and safely  . Telemedicine increases convenience for patients and providers alike and eliminates the risk of spreading infections in the clinic. However, it must be remembered that although telemedicine can be used to deliver effective diabetes care and complement current diabetes management strategies, it cannot replace all in-person consultations. Patients with complex health needs, and those who require a physical examination are not suitable for telemedicine. The Role of Precision Medicine:
 Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease prevention and treatment that considers how individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle impact disease  . The precision medicine approach allows doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment and prevention strategies for a particular disease will work in which groups of people  . This is in contrast to a one-size-fits-all approach, in which disease treatment and prevention strategies are developed with less consideration for the differences between individuals. Precision medicine has the potential to offer direct clinical benefits to patients and to be more cost-efficient for society as time and resources are not wasted on less efficacious treatments. Compared with oncology, the role of precision medicine in diabetes management is less clear given the heterogeneous nature of T2DM, and the fact that diabetes medications are usually selected based on comorbidities, cost and side effects, rather than on the specific pathophysiology underlying disease in the individual patient."

W. Nicholson","","https://scispace.com/pdf/artificial-intelligence-in-the-medical-system-four-roles-for-vvzbotlqcz.pdf","Artificial intelligence (AI) looks to transform the practice of medicine. As academics and policymakers alike turn to legal questions, including how to ensure high-quality performance by medical AI, a threshold issue involves what role AI will play in the larger medical system. This Article argues that AI can play at least four distinct roles in the medical system, each potentially transformative: pushing the frontiers of medical knowledge to increase the limits of medical performance, democratizing medical expertise by making specialist skills more available to non-specialists, automating drudgery within the medical system, and allocating scarce medical resources. Each role raises its own challenges, and an understanding of the four roles is necessary to identify and address major hurdles to the responsible development and deployment of medical AI.","to the particular patient the system is aiding. A. Pushing frontiers: In this flagship model, then, AI augments the capacity of even the best human doctors and most capable health systems, allowing them to do what they could not before. B. Replicating and democratizing expertise:
 AI can also democratize medical expertise-that is, it can make expertise available more widely than it currently is. AI can augment the capacity of generalists, so they can accomplish tasks currently limited to specialists, and it can also provide at least some care in situations with very limited current availability of any care at all. B. Replicating and democratizing expertise:
 Medical practice is limited by the availability (and cost) of specialist providers, and AI can augment the abilities of generalists to decrease that limitation, enabling more patients to access specialist care. Many patients cannot see ophthalmologists when they should-for instance, for yearly diabetic effectiveness in cancer cell lines). 9. retinopathy screens for patients with diabetes-in part because there are too few ophthalmologists, or because ophthalmologist visits are too expensive or otherwise inaccessible for some patients.  This is especially true in the developing world.  AI can help here also; for instance, the FDA approved the IDx-DR system in May 2018 for autonomous diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.  The IDx-DR consists of an automated camera that takes pictures of the retina; an operator with minimal training uses the camera, which transmits images to one algorithm for quality and then another algorithm, which determines if the patient has more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy, in which case the patient should seek further care.  IDx-DR can allow a generalist, such as a primary-care physician or nurse-practitioners, to provide screening care that would otherwise require an ophthalmologist.  Similarly, Google is developing AI-driven ophthalmological programs for deployment in India.  Along the same lines, algorithms can already identify malignant skin lesions as well as dermatologists in some situation;  patients with positive results would then presumably undertake the additional effort to seek out dermatologists or oncologists for treatment. B. Replicating and democratizing expertise:
 AI can also bring care to patients in situations where provider access is extremely limited or nonexistent. In rural areas of India, one primary care physician has responsibility for 30,000 patients.  Liberia had six ophthalmologists in 2016 for a population of 4.5 million.  Rural areas in the U.S. likewise face persistent physician shortages, though nowhere near as severe.   patients direct access to certain forms of medical care (including diagnosis or basic recommendations, for instance), and can similarly triage those patients who do in fact require access to whatever providers are available. ""Ping An Good Doctor,"" a Chinese platform, plans to combine a small waiting room about the size of a phone booth with an interactive AI-based system that solicits patient information, builds a medical history, and then communicates the relevant information to a remote cloud-based physician.  The patient would then be able to purchase medicine from the adjoining ""Smart Medicine Cabinet"" or a nearby pharmacy.  Such systems allow access to care for patients who might otherwise have little or no such access."

""Precision medicine presupposes the existence of vast processing resources and algorithms that can learn on their own at an exponential pace"". Increased recognition of AI-enabled technologies and more advanced use of AI solutions by healthcare professionals at the point of treatment have important consequences for HIM procedures. This includes functional consequences for common HIM procedures, such as medical coding, as well as, more broadly, core HIM responsibility for handling health data and knowledge. Each use case provides explanations of the expected application of AI, addresses the related effect on current HIM processes and procedures, and examines potential possibilities and obstacles for integrating HIM procedures. The enhanced awareness of AI-enabled software and the increasingly advanced use of these AI applications by healthcare professionals at the point of treatment have functional consequences for data management . Future of AI:
 Future data will not be gathered exclusively within the framework of the health care environment. Future of AI:
 The proliferation of mobile sensors will enable future physicians to track, analyze, and respond to additional streams of biomedical data obtained remotely and automatically. These technologies have been under development for a number of years. More than five years back, a blood pressure cuff that attaches to a smartphone and transmits data to a health care provider was available 36 years ago. Future of AI:
 Tools are now available that monitor glucose levels, have electrocardiogram measurements, or also capture human cognitive and mental wellbeing tests. If wearable sensors advance, they will eventually allow for continuous and discreet tracking of precise health parameters. They can replace widely worn items, such as watches, worn under standard clothing, or even incorporated into ""smart"" clothing. These types of devices can conceivably relay data back to the healthcare provider, potentially directly to the EHR, which poses numerous challenges. It would be important to trace the origins of these data as the quality, reliability, and therapeutic importance of the data can be unknown . AI linked with some more advances and transformation:
 As Francis Collins proposed in his vision of the Precision Medicine Initiative, the next generation of scientists would ""create innovative new methods for the identification, assessment, and study of a wide variety of biomedical knowledgeincluding genetic, biochemical, cellular, biological, behavioral, physiological and environmental parameters."" Conventionally, we generally speak about the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of health data, including data relating to specific patients . It has been shown that small variations in the lab values in the patient's EHR will fully modify the mortality prediction made by what is essentially a well-trained predictor; ."

Technology's impact on today's world cannot be overstated. Human work is made easier to manage and more productive by technological advancements. Errors attributable to human error have been reduced because of technological advancements in the healthcare sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to impact the medical and healthcare industries significantly. The ""quadruple goals"" of healthcare include better population health, better care for individual patients, better care for individual caregivers, and lower overall healthcare expenses. To achieve these objectives, healthcare systems across the world face significant challenges. In this paper, we examine the existing use of AI in healthcare, outline a process for creating reliable, safe, and efficient AI systems, and make some educated guesses about their future. It was determined that AI plays a crucial role in medical decision-making, especially predictive analytics when it comes to diagnosing and treating patients and managing health services in general. The current study's findings outline the implications for policymakers and regulatory authorities. In addition to that, the last section outlines the future research directions.

"Artificial intelligence in health care.","https://scispace.com/paper/artificial-intelligence-in-health-care-2t3ertfb7p","2020","Journal Article","Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","David Isaacs","10.1111/JPC.14828","https://scispace.compdf/artificial-intelligence-in-health-care-2t3ertfb7p.pdf","I have a confession to make: everyone is talking about artificial intelligence (AI), but I had no idea what it actually meant. So I set out to find out. My research tells me AI and machine learning or machine intelligence are terms used in computer science for ‘intelligence’ demonstrated by machines like computers, as opposed to the ‘natural intelligence’ of humans and some other animals and birds (Fig. 1). The concept of intelligent machines was considered and described by science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov before they became real. Mary Shelley, daughter of feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley, started writing Frankenstein, the story of an artificial being, in 1815 when she was only 18. Douglas Adams invented an Electric Monk which believed things for you in order to save you the bother of believing everything the world expected you to believe. The word intelligent comes from the Latin intelligere, meaning to understand. Is a computer that beats a chess grandmaster actually intelligent or just well programmed? Alan Turing, the brilliant English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II breaking German ciphers, whose work led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain, suggested a better question was not whether a machine was intelligent, but whether machines could exhibit intelligent behaviour. Incidentally, despite being a war hero, Turing was prosecuted for ‘gross indecency’ for the then crime of being homosexual and was ‘chemically castrated’. In 1954, at age 41, Turing died after taking cyanide. In 2009, the British Parliament pardoned Turing and apologised to him for having persecuted him. In 1956, a young mathematician John McCarthy organised a workshop on thinking machines at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. He proposed a 2-month, 10-man study of ‘artificial intelligence’, the first ever use of the term. People came and went at the workshop. Rather wonderfully, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Enthusiasm for AI waxed and waned. The late 1970s when funding was withdrawn were called the ‘AI winter’, but that winter of discontent has matured into a burgeoning springtime of AI use, including in multiple areas of health care. AI is more than just computerising tasks; it builds on and develops computing capabilities. AI is about how machines ‘learn’ the associations between things by being repeatedly exposed to data. They are agnostic as to whether or not those associations make a priori sense or are logical. AI is increasingly being used in diagnosis, treatment and research. In dermatology, AI systems get feedback data from scanned skin biopsies and gradually improve their diagnostic accuracy based on the data, although systems are not yet sufficiently reliable to be used as the exclusive determinant of which skin lesions need biopsy. Computer technology is being used in pharmacies to assist with drug dosing and even with choice of drugs. One use in research is to aid in sample-size determination. On a positive note, if reliable, AI applications have enormous potential to improve information use in resource poor settings. A literature search for AI yields lots of articles on robots. Although there is no universally agreed definition of AI, most experts agree that a robot that simply automates a task is not AI, because AI involves significant learning. Current robotic surgery has a master–slave basis; true artificially intelligent robotic surgery is still a way off. Surgeons are rapidly training themselves in using robot-assisted (minimally invasive) surgery to operate on adults with proven or suspected malignancy, gynaecological problems including tubal sterilisation, and prostatic hypertrophy. There is less use of robots in children, although there are reports of paediatric robot-assisted surgery being used to perform pyeloplasty in the USA and to treat solid tumours in the UK, albeit with little or no evaluation as yet of the advantages and disadvantages. The names are great. The main US robotic surgical system is called the da Vinci Surgical System, a fitting tribute to the 16th century polymath, vegetarian, liberator of caged birds, so beloved of paediatricians (Fig. 2). A robot soothingly named Calmer is better at reducing pain in neonates than ‘facilitated tucking’. Robots are increasingly being used for the rehabilitation and education of children with disability, although research seems to Fig. 1 Artwork showing Jjaibot, an artificial intelligence robot capable of detecting human emotions such as anger, joy and happiness. doi:10.1111/jpc.14828","automate high-volume, low-value procedures .

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool capable of addressing these issues by enhancing diagnostics, treatment planning, patient monitoring, and healthcare efficiency. AI’s role in modern medicine spans disease detection, personalized care, drug discovery, predictive analytics, telemedicine, and wearable health technologies. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning, AI can analyze complex data sets, including electronic health records, medical imaging, and genomic profiles, to identify patterns, predict disease progression, and recommend optimized treatment strategies. AI also has the potential to promote equity by enabling cost-effective, resource-efficient solutions in low-resource and remote settings, such as mobile diagnostics, wearable biosensors, and lightweight algorithms. Successful deployment requires addressing critical challenges, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, model interpretability, regulatory oversight, and maintaining human clinical oversight. Emphasizing scalable, ethical, and evidence-driven implementation, key strategies include clinician training in AI literacy, adoption of resource efficient tools, global collaboration, and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency, safety, and accountability. By complementing rather than replacing healthcare professionals, AI can reduce errors, optimize resources, improve patient outcomes, and expand access to quality care. This review emphasizes the responsible integration of AI as a powerful catalyst for innovation, sustainability, and equity in healthcare delivery worldwide. ","learning and privacy-preserving computation offer mitigation strategies by allowing models to be trained on distributed data without compromising patient confidentiality. Furthermore, international agreements on data governance and equitable benefit-sharing will be essential to overcome geopolitical divides and ensure global access to AI-driven advances . Future perspectives and recommendations:
 In summary, the transformative potential of AI in healthcare is undeniable, but its realization will depend on addressing critical enablers and barriers. By grounding future developments in diverse data sets, adaptive policies, cost-effective implementation strategies, and international collaboration, AI can move from experimental promise to sustainable integration in clinical practice. Future perspectives and recommendations:
 At the same time, explicit recognition of the risk's bias, regulatory gaps, inequitable access, and data fragmentation together with proactive mitigation strategies will ensure that AI evolves as a safe, ethical, and globally accessible tool for improving human health. Conclusion:
 Artificial intelligence is no longer a distant prospect but an integral component of modern healthcare, transforming diagnostics, drug discovery, precision medicine, and health system operations. However, for AI to progress from promising innovations to globally trusted solutions, stakeholders must go beyond proof-of-concept applications and focus on scalable, equity-driven implementation.

 Robotic systems, equipped with advanced imaging technologies and microsurgical instruments, enable surgeons to perform highly precise manoeuvres with enhanced dexterity and control. This level of precision is particularly crucial in procedures involving delicate eye structures. Robotics:
 Cybersurgery, the concept of remote surgical intervention, has yet to be established in ophthalmology, as the issue of transmitting tactile information across low latency networks (ideally <200 ms) using haptic feedback systems must be solved . Robotics:
 Robot-assisted technology is being studied in intravitreal injections for patients with retinal pathologies with greater efficiency . Despite the technological strides, patient receptiveness to robotic interventions, particularly in procedures like intravitreal injections, varies, with several factors influencing their willingness to embrace such innovations . Teleophthalmology in retinal diseases: case studies 4.1 The case of diabetic retinopathy:
 Teleophthalmology is the backbone of multiple nationally and regionally implemented retinal screening initiatives, such as screening for DR in the United Kingdom (UK), Singapore, and India. DR screening initiatives are designed to achieve early identification and treatment of patients with potentially vision-threatening diseases, thereby mitigating the risk of sight loss. United Kingdom:
 In the UK, the overarching body responsible for coordinating DR screening programs is the National Screening Committee. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their local committee overseeing the screening efforts. Each program may have minor variations in its approach, but they share a standard core structure."

Research on AI assisted automated OCT analysis to assess OCT biomarkers to predict outcomes of treatment such as intravitreal injections for various retinal disorders is on-going. Role of deep learning and DR screening and its future:
 The AI devices provides a screening decision without requiring an ophthalmologist to interpret the retinal images, hence can be used by physicians who may not normally be involved in eye care. The integration of AI into healthcare, would be expected to radically change clinical practice with more people getting screened for retinopathy. With the exponential increase in the prevalence of diabetes, AI can ease the pressure on the healthcare system, particularly in India and in other lower and middle income countries with large number of people with diabetes to be screened for retinopathy with limited resources. AI based software in ophthalmology provide an easier and more convenient option for the people to detect the disease at an early stage at the physician clinic and hence the patient satisfaction levels could be better. Automated DR screening methods can make the screening process more efficient, cost-effective, reproducible, and accessible. A multicentre study in India (SMART India) will evaluate the clinical and costeffectiveness of automated DR screening in India. The study is funded by the Global Challenge Research Fund from the United Kingdom Research and Innovations (UKRI) with the aim of translating the results globally. Conclusion:
 Automated analysis with integration of AI in DR detection can be safely implemented and appears to be a promising solution for screening large number of people with diabetes globally. DL has shown impressive results of high sensitivity and specificity in automated image analysis of fundus photographs. Artificial intelligence would act as an auxiliary part and a useful assistant in DR screening and provide diagnostic support and cannot replace the role of ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis and management. Future development of AI technology will generate medical advances, and the physicians and ophthalmologists would need to learn how to utilize the technical advances with care. Robust diagnostic AI-based technology to automate DR screening would help increase referral of people with STDR and other retinal diseases to the ophthalmologist / retina specialist for further management and hence would aid in reducing visual impairment.

This study explored medical students' and interns' knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), perceptions of the role of AI in medicine, and preferences around the teaching of AI competencies.In this cross-sectional study, the authors used a previously validated Canadian questionnaire and gathered responses from students and interns at KIST Medical College, Nepal. Face validity and reliability of the tool were assessed by administering the questionnaire to 20 alumni as a pilot sample (Cronbach alpha = 0.6). Survey results were analyzed quantitatively (p-value = 0.05).In total 216 students (37% response rate) participated. The median AI knowledge score was 11 (interquartile range 4), and the maximum possible score was 25. The score was higher among final year students (p = 0.006) and among those with additional training in AI (p = 0.040). Over 49% strongly agreed or agreed that AI will reduce the number of jobs for doctors. Many expect AI to impact their specialty choice, felt the Nepalese health-care system is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of AI, and opined every student of medicine should receive training on AI competencies.The lack of coverage of AI and machine learning in Nepalese medical schools has resulted in students being unaware of AI's impact on individual patients and the healthcare system. A high perceived willingness among respondents to learn about AI is a positive sign and a strong indicator of futuristic successful curricula changes. Systematic implementation of AI in the Nepalese healthcare system can be a potential tool in addressing health-care challenges related to resource and manpower constraints. Incorporating topics related to AI and machine learning in medical curricula can be a useful first step. ","among the respondents of AI as demonstrated by lower perception-related responses. The perceptions improved as students progressed to a higher year of study. A better perception may be linked with what students hear and read about AI in social media, news, and other avenues. Discussion:
 The contribution of AI and machine learning in individual patient care involving diagnosis and treatment is well documented in the literature.  AI has proven benefits in many disease conditions such as obesity, GI diseases, oncology, cardiovascular conditions, etc. It has also proven to be beneficial in offering preventive health recommendations.  In the present research, only one-tenth of the respondents felt that AI can provide patients with preventative health recommendations such as exercise, diet, and wellness. Multiple published evidence supports AI applications in these conditions,  which the responding students were not aware of. However, a review on the role of AI in diabetic retinopathy screening emphasized various challenges including medicolegal implications and ethical issues to be resolved in order to expedite the application of AI in these situations.  Of the student respondents, nearly half felt AI can analyze patient information to reach diagnoses while it is clearly documented in the literature that AI can perform as well as or better than human beings in diagnosing diseases.  Students also had a poor perception of the fact that AI can analyze patient information to establish prognoses. The research findings thus clearly demonstrate that the role of AI in the clinical diagnosis of patients using patient information is not well understood by the students. Discussion:
 Another important highlight of the present research is that only very few (one-tenth) felt AI can read and interpret diagnostic imaging. It is clearly documented that AI algorithms have made pathbreaking improvements in imagerecognition tasks and are likely to impact the practice of radiodiagnosis.  While, this branch of medicine is considered a rapidly evolving field in incorporating AI, medical students from Germany viewed AI could detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83%) but not establish definite diagnoses (56%).  In the present study, only one-quarter of the respondents felt that AI can formulate personalized treatment plans for patients and a low number of respondents felt that AI can formulate personalized medication prescriptions for patients as well as monitor patient compliance to prescribed medications, exercise, and dietary recommendations. Discussion:
 These findings clearly show a poor understanding among the student respondents of the potential role of AI in precision medicine. There are multiple pieces of literature confirming the role of AI in precision medicine for cardiovascular medicine,  cancer,  etc. Robotic surgery is a rapidly advancing field with good precision and accuracy. Currently, robotic surgery is controlled by human surgeons who are susceptible to physical, mental, and technical variables, limiting the consistency of performance. On the other hand, surgical robots are resistant to fatigue, and tremors and offer better scalable motion and a high range of axial movement  leading to greater precision and low morbidity rates.  It is expected that AI control algorithms can offer benefits to robotic surgeries by reducing errors, and time and ultimately improving outcomes by reducing human error.  But, in the present research, only 12% of the respondents mentioned AI can perform surgery (eg, robotic surgery)."

The emergence of AI in health care, the reduced costs of digital data, and the availability of usable digital images are now in alignment for digital pathology to succeed. Discussion and conclusion:
 However, there are some barriers to the technological diffusion of AI in some medical fields. A major unresolved issue is how AI will be implemented in routine clinical practice. Numerous intertwined problems will have to be addressed to overcome several significant obstacles for the diffusion of AI in pathology and other branches of medical science. Discussion and conclusion:
 Firstly, digital pathology based on AI may likely be costly at the initial phase of diffusion of this new technology owing to additional workflow, including personnel, AI must demonstrate improved efficiency, quality, and safety. These issues are the first and immediate barriers to a broad application of AI in pathology and clinical practice. However, benefits will inevitably come from the use of AI with digital images and multiple data sets, for example, integrating genomic data and radiologic images to further enhance the value of combined data utilization for the overall health care system. Recent examples with skin lesions, diabetic retinopathy, and radiology detection have highlighted the potential that AI provides to aid clinicians to improve quality, safety and diagnosis . Discussion and conclusion:
 Secondly, the cost of new technological devices is an economic barrier. This cost is associated to the efficacy and efficiency of AI in pathology that have to be clearly demonstrated to government and third-party payers (e.g., insurance companies) developing reimbursement strategies. Although some reimbursement codes exist for computational analyses in the USA, they are not widely used and often are rejected. With US national health care reimbursement trends moving to quality and safety metrics, the recognition of AI technology as part of reimbursement strategies that reward value-based care, rather than fee for service value-based care, would provide important incentives to develop and implement validated algorithms of AI in clinical practice. Discussion and conclusion:
 Thirdly, the critical factor for AI technology is human capital and education that will be the greatest challenge and will require the longest period to address. AI and other computational methods must be integrated into all training programs of the schools of medicine worldwide. Future generations of pathologists and physicians must have technical skills Journal of Social and Administrative Sciences comfortable to use digital images and other data in combination for accurate diagnosis. Discussion and conclusion:
 Overall, then, the promise of AI in health care is the delivery of improved quality and safety of care with the great potential of reducing the inequality in the access to healthcare sector between people within poor and rich countries. Put otherwise, AI technology in medicine can increase the democratization of the health care system, and it can potentially provide value in many economic sectors generating benefits for an industrial and corporate change based on this new technological paradigm. For instance, radiologists can now read imaging studies from anywhere in the world at their home institution/office, bringing expert care to parts of the world that previously had limited expertise. Pathology has the opportunity to do the same with digital imaging and AI combined with ICTs can permit rapid and accurate local care, also in developing countries where there is a high burden of diseases and low medical equipment."

Clinical trials' results provide the basis for guidance and support for official protocols that clinicians use to base their decisions. However, individuals do not consistently demonstrate the reported response from relevant clinical trials. The decision complexity increases with combination treatments where drugs administered together can interact with each other, which is often the case. Additionally, the individual's response to the treatment varies with the changes in their condition. In practice, the drug and the dose selection depend significantly on the medical protocol and the medical team's experience. As such, the results are inherently varied and often suboptimal. Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have emerged as excellent decision-making tools, but multiple challenges limit their application. AI is a rapidly evolving and dynamic field with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life. AI has become increasingly crucial in drug discovery and development. AI enhances decision-making across different disciplines, such as medicinal chemistry, molecular and cell biology, pharmacology, pathology, and clinical practice. In addition to these, AI contributes to patient population selection and stratification. The need for AI in healthcare is evident as it aids in enhancing data accuracy and ensuring the quality care necessary for effective patient treatment. AI is pivotal in improving success rates in clinical practice. The increasing significance of AI in drug discovery, development, and clinical trials is underscored by many scientific publications. Despite the numerous advantages of AI, such as enhancing and advancing Precision Medicine (PM) and remote patient monitoring, unlocking its full potential in healthcare requires addressing fundamental concerns. These concerns include data quality, the lack of well-annotated large datasets, data privacy and safety issues, biases in AI algorithms, legal and ethical challenges, and obstacles related to cost and implementation. Nevertheless, integrating AI in clinical medicine will improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, contribute to more efficient healthcare delivery, reduce costs, and facilitate better patient experiences, making healthcare more sustainable.

A few trends are already foreseeable such as an increased number of patients, advanced technologies, different health-related business models, increased costs, revised ethics, and regulatory procedures. Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation. Indeed, forward-looking innovation about exponential technologies and their effect on healthcare is now gaining momentum. Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The “P4 of health”, a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem.

Hence, large-scale transformations should be encouraged to evolve this system overcoming the current obstacles. DISCUSSION:
 Moreover, the need to evolve clinical practice into a transformed ecosystem is also the response to 21st-century challenges . Indeed, Industry 4.0 and digital transformation brought disruptive and innovative technologies to enter our workplaces and private life and thus influencing the healthcare system to digitally transform. However, even though healthcare is not yet ready to shift toward a digitalized and decentralized system, the Covid-19 pandemic represented a considerable event while forcing the urgency of remote E-health services and monitoring. Whether it is clear that digitalization and advanced technologies in healthcare would bring opportunities and a novel set of values , the importance of revising education and training programs cannot be neglected to allow this transformation . Moreover, learning how to implement these advances to enhance patient care and experience  is the key when thinking of which aspect and innovative strategy should healthcare invest its effort in. DISCUSSION:
 In this regard, our study was firstly aimed to investigate the future of health from a technological and clinical point of view. Secondly, our ultimate goal is the realization of these visions to improve services, procedures, and health democratization in a perspective that is patient-centric, preventive, predictive, and proactive . We developed a framework to detect relevant areas of investigation, followed by the analysis and visualization of holistic trends concerning advanced medical technologies and innovative health-related business models. Indeed, the methodology would help the visualization and consequent translation of predicted technological and clinical developments toward healthcare democratization. Thus, we engaged stakeholders by conducting an online survey to explore the opinion of participants, working in different medical sectors, about the future of healthcare in a short term (3-5 years) and long term (>10 years) perspective. DISCUSSION:
 Digital healthcare, electronic and sensors, and data management have been found to be the three most innovative technologies that would be implemented in healthcare in a short and long-term perspective. Not surprisingly, the future of healthcare is already moving toward the implementation of digital platforms, and globally connected networks while generating a novel ecosystem that is dynamic, autonomous, and made of multiple decentralized stakeholders. Moreover, hospitals and home care were considered the two main settings where advanced technologies and procedures are mostly expected to be implemented. Thus, the future of health will rotate around two main protagonists such as hospitals and homes, and in which the majority of procedures will take place. According to Zimlichman et al. ( ) hospitalat-home programs would improve patients' outcomes with increased satisfaction at lower costs. This trend would also allow a personalized approach to health preventing and predicting the occurrence of diseases besides reducing long hospitalizations. Thus, this will represent what is called telehealth; a decentralized system, remotely accessible, and able to guarantee real-time monitoring, while shifting care services from hospitals to homes. DISCUSSION:
 Moreover, to enhance health delivery in a 5-10 years perspective, AI systems stand out among other advanced technologies. Indeed, in clinical diagnostic, AI can predict and prevent disease development, while supporting physicians in making better decisions suitable for specific patients' needs. Besides, by combining AI with health wearables, patients monitoring devices will be the solution for continuous remote health monitoring and digital-based services."

 A number of governmental and commercial organizations have recently released recommendations and guidelines for the appropriate use of AI in response to these issues. The study, however, reveals a considerable discrepancy in the alleged transparency characteristics. Many critical difficulties in medicine may be resolved with the use of AI. I. INTRODUCTION:
 Numerous cases have gained pace in recent years as a result of significant research on automated prognosis, diagnosis, testing, and medicine formulation . Along with genetic data, biosensors, and medical imaging, these sources create a large quantity of data . I. INTRODUCTION:
 A critical objective of AI in medicine is to personalize medical decisions, health practices, and medications for unique people. Nevertheless, the current state of AI in medicine has been described as ""strong on promise but rather lacking in evidence and demonstration"". I. INTRODUCTION:
 Real-world clinical settings have been tested to detect wrist fractures, diabetic retinopathy, cancer metastases, histologic breast, congenital cataracts, and colonic polyps; however, many of the systems that have been demonstrated to be equivalent to or superior to experts in experimental settings have demonstrated high false-positive rates in real-world clinical settings . I. INTRODUCTION:
 Additionally, prejudice, security, privacy, and a deficit of transparency exist, as do trust, fairness, informativeness, transferability, and causality . Numerous critical difficulties in medicine may be resolved with the use of AI . I. INTRODUCTION:
 Together with medical imaging, biosensors, genetic data, and electronic medical records, these sources create a large quantity of data . To make a precise diagnosis in precision medicine, doctors need substantially more information than a simple binary prediction . I. INTRODUCTION:
 ML in medicine has grown more concerned with explainability, interpretability, and openness . There is sufficient evidence that ML-based methods are helpful; however, their widespread adoption is unlikely until these issues are solved, most likely by providing systems with adequate explanations for their judgments ."

In the United States, underserved and minority populations are disproportionately affected by diabetic retinopathy and other diabetes-related health outcomes. In this narrative review, we describe racial disparities in the prevalence and screening of diabetic retinopathy, as well as the wide-range of disparities associated with social determinants of health (SDOH), which include socioeconomic status, geography, health-care access, and education.","with lower average income, having government-provided insurance, and having lower visual acuity . Efforts to recruit study participants who are typically underrepresented can help determine the impact of new DR treatments in all people with diabetes, while promoting health and equity. Conclusions:
 As the prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. and worldwide continues to increase, as does the burden of diabetes-related complications, particularly diabetic retinopathy and macular edema, it is important to address inequities due to SDOH in the prevalence, screening, management, and outcomes of DRD. Lower socioeconomic status, household income, education, rural geography, and minority status are all associated with reduced access to diabetic retinopathy screening. Delays in diagnosis compounded with risk factors for diabetic retinopathy portends worse visual outcomes. Implementation of accessible DR screening programs using teleretinal networks or autonomous artificial intelligence-based screening in underserved and under-resourced rural and low-income areas can improve early detection of DR, thereby reducing poor visual outcomes in these communities. The diagnostic accuracy achievable by AI paired with its scalability has the potential to increase screening access and diagnosis, and mitigate disparities related to social determinants of health, provided that diagnosability, racial and ethnic bias, explainability, and data usage are adequate addressed in the development. Early detection and diagnosis of DR can also improve long-term visual outcomes for the millions of individuals with diabetes in the US. Although there have been significant advancements in the management of DRD, offering equitable therapies and optimizing adherence where disparities exist can help improve visual outcomes. Future research should aim to increase generalizability in clinical trials with a greater representation of minority populations in study cohorts, as well as the evaluation of visual outcomes further down the clinical pathway. Efforts to promote equity in diabetes clinical care should focus on mitigating care gaps related to social determinants of health to ensure optimal visual outcomes for all people with diabetes. Conclusions:
 There are limitations to this narrative review in that publications reviewed focused on the US health care system; therefore, they do not address global concerns around inequities and social determinants of health associated with diabetic retinopathy."

Deep learning, as a process of artificial intelligence (AI) is used in ophthalmology for data analysis, segmentation, automated diagnosis and possible outcome predictions. The association of deep learning and optical coherence tomography (OCT) technologies has proven reliable for the detection of retinal diseases and improving the diagnostic performance of the eye's posterior segment diseases. This review explored the possibility of implementing and using AI in establishing the diagnosis of retinal disorders. The benefits and limitations of AI in the field of retinal disease medical management were investigated by analyzing the most recent literature data. Furthermore, the future trends of AI involvement in ophthalmology were analyzed, as AI will be part of the decision-making regarding the scientific investigation, diagnosis and therapeutic management.","obtained by deep learning assessment, or when a patient does not receive counseling related to the required treatment it is necessary to introduce and apply medicolegal and ethical regulations. Limitations: All these potential shortcomings highlight the need for continuous improvement in AI technology. The future:
 In the near future, AI will become more involved in the decision-making regarding the scientific investigation, diagnosis and therapeutic management. Tele-ophthalmology applications can transmit information to less developed regions that face a shortage of specialists . Already, a hybrid algorithm, with high sensitivity and specificity, named IDx-DR, approved by FDA as a low to moderate risk device, is used for diabetic retinopathy screening, aiding the management of patients that need referral to an ophthalmologist. AI can quickly analyze large databases. Based on these analyzes, AI can explore the associations between disease features that may not be easily obvious to humans. The future:
 The clinical analysis of the ophthalmologist supported by the DL analysis results will improve the individualization of the medical management, for the benefit of the patients . The future:
 AI also plays an important role in scientific research. With the help of AI, the features of newly discovered eye diseases can be identified . It is expected that AI algorithms will help in identifying new biomarkers, specific to each disease, as they are able to search for characteristics themselves and are not limited to only recognizing clinical features. The future:
 Ongoing research aims to develop autonomous software able to diagnose simultaneously AMD, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, predict progression and recommend personalized treatment. Conclusions:
 AI/ DL (deep learning) algorithms using both OCT and fundus will revolutionize techniques and methodologies of image analysis. Optimizing these (combined) technologies will accelerate the progress in this area. Currently, there are software programs that standardize OCT images from various devices and the results of these software packages are comparable when the appropriate metrics are used consistently. Nevertheless, large databases, using real patient data, are required to optimize the performance of this type of analysis. Thus, computer-assisted screening, diagnosis and prediction of the ophthalmic disease will reach new frontiers. Conclusions:
 In ophthalmology AI has the potential to increase patient access to clinical screening/diagnosis and decrease health-care costs, especially when the risk of the disease occurrence is high or the communities confront with low financial resources. However, legal regulations and solving of the reproducibility issues are required before AI based screening is incorporated in clinical practice."

This interest is driven in high-income countries by challenges in managing high volume chronic conditions (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma). Deep learning is particularly suited to these conditions because their diagnosis and management is largely dependent on retinal photography (appendix 2 p 15) and optical coherence tomography (appendix 2 p 16). Artificial intelligence has many potential applications in eye health that could enhance delivery, optimise health system functioning, and lead to improved patient outcomes. Examples of potential uses that are in development include supporting point-of-care diagnostics,  surgical decision making (risk stratification),  or patient management and treatment.  The most likely early application in public health programmes will be in screening for diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity.  Artificial intelligence solutions can possibly be integrated with electronic medical records to support administrative tasks such as identifying patients with a specific eye condition or at-risk patients.  Artificial intelligence can be used in clinical, epidemiological, and health system research to incorporate data on social determinants of health, identify at-risk patient populations, and help to prioritise scarce clinical resources.  This area presents an opportunity to address the link between poverty and blindness, and the need to promote equity in eye health.  Finally, artificial intelligence coupled with telemedicine and mHealth could help to reach populations with poor health system access, either because of geographical isolation or scarcity of human resources for eye health.  There is little information on implementing artificial intelligence in eye health delivery and even less on whether it could improve care or outcomes. Before deployment into routine clinical practice, artificial intelligence applications require external validation on data that were not previously used in algorithm development and should undergo rigorous safety and efficacy testing in prospective clinical studies. In 2018, IDx-DR was the first artificial intelligence screening product for diabetic retinopathy to obtain approval from the FDA, after demonstrating good diagnostic accuracy in a prospective trial  done in a real-world setting. Artificial intelligence:
 To assess the extent of translation-ready artificial intelligence (in use or soon to be in use), this Commission did a scoping review for publications related to artificial intelligence in eye health since 2015 to 2020 (appendix 1 p 71). We identified 1256 primary data reports, most (60%) focused on retinal imaging (20% diabetic retinopathy, 16% glaucoma, and 6% age-related macular degeneration). Only 12% of reports addressed conditions that affect the anterior segment and 1•5% were on childhood eye conditions. Most (90%), reported on artificial intelligence model development and internal validation. Of 113 reports on external validation or successful deployment in clinical settings, most were for retinal conditions (58%), facilitated by greater availability of images. Arguably, the greatest potential for artificial intelligence to contribute to advancing eye health would be to assist in case identification and health system efficiency, helping people with uncorrected refractive error and cataract access services, neither of which are currently well represented in artificial intelligence development platforms."

Detection of DR requires substantial human resources and high medical costs. Therefore, the use of diagnostic software has been recently explored. The study aimed to assess the results of DR diagnoses by Cybersight, an artificial intelligence software. A total of 1,012 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (1,943 eyes) with a mean age of 74.61 ± 6.73 years were included. Comprehensive demographic and clinical data were gathered, and all patients underwent color fundus photography following Cybersight's standardized protocols. The study compared Cybersight's accuracy with that of ophthalmologists in identifying key DR lesions, including retinal microvascular changes, exudates, hemorrhages, the diagnosis and staging of DR, using sensitivity, specificity, and weighted Kappa metrics. The prevalence of DR was 16.2%. A high level of agreement was found between Cybersight and ophthalmologists in DR diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 85.0%, specificity of 95.8%, and a weighted Kappa of 0.78. The presence of cataracts and the degree of pupil dilation notably impacted on the accuracy of DR diagnosis. The results have important implications for the potential application of Cybersight as a low-cost and effective tool for diabetic eye screening. ","according to the latest international guidelines enhances the study's clinical relevance and comparability. However, a significant limitation of this research lies in its exclusive focus on patients with T2DM, thereby restricting the generalizability of the findings across all DM types. Discussion:
 Additionally, excluding eyes with severe cataracts due to the software's limitations in generating accurate results represents a notable drawback. Nonetheless, the study reaffirms the early diagnostic efficacy of AI software, underscoring its utility in the prompt detection of DR. Conclusion:
 While AI and ophthalmologists were working separately, this study demonstrated the reliable and precise clinical efficacy of the Cybersight AI Software in autonomously detecting DR without ophthalmologist intervention. Conclusion:
 Implementing this AI system holds promise for enhancing DR screening and monitoring among individuals with T2DM by non-ophthalmic healthcare providers, facilitating accurate identification of DR for timely referrals in clinical settings. Conclusion:
 These findings underscore the practicality of this automated tool for endocrinologists, diabetologists, and ophthalmologists in addressing the escalating need for DR screening and monitoring."

 Artificial intelligence (AI) uses computer algorithms to imitate the human intellect, which is becoming increasingly common in medicine. AI in medicine enables rapid and accurate analysis of medical data, which is beyond the ability of human doctors. INTRODUCTION:
 Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, adapts its parameters based on data to generate computer algorithms for making predictions and responding to data. INTRODUCTION:
 The integration of AI is particularly advantageous in ophthalmology, where the field's extensive use of digital imaging techniques made many modalities to be used together with quantifiable parameters such as visual acuity or foveal thickness. INTRODUCTION:
 A significant dataset is made available by the growth of multi-modal digital images and electronic medical databases in ophthalmology for AI analysis. INTRODUCTION:
 ML, which was originally introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959, refers to an AI process in which a machine autonomously generates its programing and acquires the ability to execute tasks independently . INTRODUCTION:
 In supervised ML models, the machine learns from pre-existing data containing accurate answers, making it particularly valuable for classification purposes, whether dealing with categorical values like ""disease"" or ""no disease"" or variables that may take on any value within a range, such as height or weight . INTRODUCTION:
 The process involves utilizing a validation dataset to assess external validity. Conversely, unsupervised ML involves examining data without predefined answers, with the primary objective of modeling the data structure or distribution to gain insights. This method is especially useful for identifying associations among data. INTRODUCTION:
 The integration of the capabilities of human doctors with those of deep learning (DL) algorithms is anticipated to reduce mistakes in diagnoses and therapies inherent in the existing systems . INTRODUCTION:
 These models provide more accurate recommendations from basic eye care services provided in the community to professional ophthalmologists, ultimately optimizing diagnosis. Tele ophthalmology has significantly contributed to enhancing the availability of eye screening and facilitating distant expert evaluations in rural areas. INTRODUCTION:
 This can be achieved via synchronous and mixed synchronous-asynchronous solutions  or ""store, forward and video consultation"" methods . However, despite the improved clinical outcomes shown by digital ophthalmology solutions, their growth potential is constrained by the need for more infrastructure and professionals to implement them. INTRODUCTION:
 Unlike telemedicine and AI, which are not restricted to specific locations (such as to address the demand for eye hospitals that specialize in certain eye conditions or the availability of knowledgeable eye care professionals), these solutions may be combined with other technological advancements, such as imaging apparatus, to effectively deliver and improve primary care and eye screening services. INTRODUCTION:
 Given the documented relationships between clinical features and disease severity in major eye issues, AI is particularly well-suited for use in eye screening. Early detection and treatment of ocular conditions are critical for preventing visual impairment and improving the general quality of life. INTRODUCTION:

 Themost effective method to preserving vision in diabetes mellitus (DM) is early screening, early diagnosis, and early treatment . Because diabetic retinopathy (DR) has a long asymptomatic stage, early detection is critical, as timely intervention can reduce visual impairment . Fundus photography has been acknowledged as a technique of screening for DR, with grading executed by skilled certified retina specialists or ophthalmologists. Because of the continued increase in the number of diabetics and the limited supply of trained retinal specialists, an automated approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) for DR screening has begun to pique the interest of healthcare providers . AI techniques are used on digital images obtained from a fundus camera. Which then provides a detailed image from within the eye (the retinal image). Such automated techniques provide cost-effective solutions to the existing screening challenge . Introduction:
 AI-based solutions techniques have shown medically comparable results to human assessment in existing DR screening programs . Traces of establishment of AI has been observed in Singapore and United Kingdom where they have shown to be robust and cost effective . A study in Nakuru, Kenya concluded that AI could be incorporated into health systems and assisted eye care specialist who were already in short supply in low-income countries . As AI is seamlessly being launched and subsequently incorporated into healthcare, healthcare professionals will be anticipated to use AI technology to manage, diagnose, and treat their patients. Several studies have been carried out to evaluate the perceptions and knowledge of healthcare providers and medical students on AI . To implement AI tools in healthcare that will be satisfactory for everyone, it is very important to initiate a collaborative effort between all those involved. There is no traceable evidence suggesting that AI application in DR screening has been established in the country, particularly in government health facilities. In its establishment, it is vital to capacitate personnel to use these kinds of technologies to meet the intended objectives. As well as to avoid ""white elephants"" due to lack of knowledge on utilization of the equipment. As a result, eye care clinicians input is amongst the most influential signifiers of organizational preparedness, and it must be taken into account in this new age of technological advancement . The first pillar (suitable economic development) of the country's Vision 2036 encompasses Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It states ""We will leverage leading ICT as a key contributor to economic growth and employment whilst also enabling an efficient and public sector' . Similarly, this study hopes to provide information on the use of AI as a technology to assist the public health sector in addressing the already-existing shortage of critical eye healthcare specialists, such as DR graders/screeners."

 Data collection, storage, normalisation, and tracking are all important uses of AI in healthcare. Google's artificial intelligence (AI) research division has unveiled a new initiative called DeepMind Health, which will be used to sift through mountains of medical information in an effort to improve and speed up healthcare delivery. Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust began working together on a joint endeavour to enhance eye care in 2016. Moorfields provided DeepMind with a collection of one million randomized eye scans and some anonymous statistics about eye health and illness management to explore how technology may aid to evaluate eye scans.

With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. Understanding patient’s metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome.

This necessitates development of progressive healthcare environment that will enable clinicians and researchers to gain a complete picture of the patient to deepen their understanding, using additional details from healthcare and Fig.  Design modeling of heterogenous patient-specific healthcare, genomics, metabolomics, phenotypic, and lifestyle data, and publicly available annotation data including genes, variants, diseases, drugs, and biomarkers.

Furthermore, resource allocation for data storage and computational analysis multi-omics data. We hypothesize that clinical information will enrich genomics and metabolomics data such that combined predictors will perform better than the individual classifiers only based on either genomics, metabolomics, or clinical data. Practically supporting the hypothesis, we need to design research methodology, which includes modeling of patient-specific (healthcare, genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and lifestyle) and publicly available annotation (genes, variants, diseases, drugs, biomarkers) data storage, management, integration, knowledgebase creation, and analysis using different artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches (Fig. ) .

 Precision medicine is moving forward but with many challenges that require addition of useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches to efficiently manage massive heterogeneous data, augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory, and public health systems. A major barrier to implementation of precision medicine is the data analysis requirement. Most of the precision medicine efforts today are manual or semi-automated, time-consuming, and unable to facilitate on-demand analysis of diverse human datasets to impact critical treatment windows and predict potential disease risks . The traditional way of computational analysis is based on running a series of command-line applications, which require good programming skills and ability to work in the UNIX environment. It hinders linking information generated at different stages of treatments and experiments conducted at levels of sampling, sequencing, and analysis. While precision medicine analyses require complex coordinated efforts between disparate groups with non-aligned data formats and massive amounts of computing time that is essential in many cases to positively impact treatment outcomes. Furthermore, it is difficult but mandatory to address ethical and social issues related to healthcare data collection, privacy, and protection with effective balance .

The earliest stage of DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), may progress to sight-threatening DR (STDR). Thus, early detection of DR and active regular screening of patients with diabetes are necessary for earlier intervention to prevent sight loss. While some countries offer systematic DR screening, most nations are reliant on opportunistic screening or do not offer any screening owing to limited healthcare resources and infrastructure. Currently, retinal imaging approaches for DR screening include those with and without mydriasis, imaging in single or multiple fields, and the use of conventional or ultra-wide-field imaging. Advances in telescreening and automated detection facilitate screening in previously hard-to-reach communities. Despite the heterogeneity in approaches to fit local needs, an evidence base must be created for each model to inform practice. In this review, we appraise different aspects of DR screening, including technological advances, identify evidence gaps, and propose several studies to improve DR screening globally, with a view to identifying patients with moderate-to-severe NPDR who would benefit if a convenient treatment option to delay progression to STDR became available.","herein suggest that telescreening for DR can be successful while also reducing travel time and costs for patients with diabetes, and despite higher referral numbers owing to ungradable images, patients appear to prefer this approach, thus improving patient adherence and engagement. Recommendations for Future Studies:
 To plan and feasibly implement DR screening in public health policies globally, we propose several studies to assess the extent of DR and screening best practice. To employ successful DR screening programs that are cost effective and efficient, the best approach needs to be determined; incorporating the recent advances in technology and telescreening could impact DR screening, while balancing cost, practicality, and patient preference, as well as patient outcomes. Studies should focus on developing a telescreening methodology that can be applied on a large scale and across different regions. For example, a non-mydriatic or staged mydriatic methodology that would allow evaluation of the predictive accuracy of digital imaging in different populations using digital fundus photography in three fields may offer an acceptable compromise on sensitivity and ease of execution. Other studies should include the evaluation of AI automated detection versus traditional approaches and aim to standardize the second-tier referral process for patients requiring treatment and ungradable images. Research projects exploring whether the use of hand held devices, advanced optics, and newer technology (including UWF imaging and retinal function measurements) are feasible for future large-scale telescreening would be particularly helpful in terms of ease of use, reliability, and costs. The impact of patient-driven approaches such as smartphone pupillometry and automated non-mydriatic fundus cameras situated in public places should also be studied as a means to increase patient-driven screening. Conclusions:
 This review is limited to the published data available; however, it is clear that great attempts are being made worldwide in the fields of telescreening, automated detection using AI, and patient-initiated testing with smartphones and unmanned kiosks to diagnose and manage the escalating problem of diabetes and DR, despite the immense challenges with resources and infrastructure. However, despite these efforts, evidence gaps remain. Telescreening approaches and equipment need to be compared and ideally standardized, and AI and smartphone technologies need to be rigorously tested to ensure adequate sensitivity and specificity. We believe that a more standardized and collaborative approach would lead to the establishment of the best approach to DR screening practice, as well as data sharing for research purposes and cost efficiency. Conclusions:
 In countries with inadequate primary care systems, a holistic approach to screening for diabetes is highly recommended to prevent end-organ damage in the absence of a routine screening program. This, at a minimum, should include retinal screening, as well as foot examinations, blood pressure monitoring, and urine albumin, HbA 1c , and lipid testing. A collateral benefit of DR screening, which may be underappreciated, is that it can also identify other conditions, including retinal disease and other microvascular conditions."

While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype and attention around the topic are significant. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful. For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities of A.I. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I. We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as attempt to provide a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice.","that offers A.I.-driven consultation. It uses the patient's medical history and common medical knowledge. Patients report their symptoms through the app which checks those in a database of diseases using speech recognition. After that, it offers a course of action . Health assistance and medication management:
 The medical start-up Sense.ly developed Molly, a virtual nurse that was designed to have a smiling face coupled with a pleasant voice. Its goal is to help assist patients with monitoring their health or disease management in-between doctor's visits using ML. It also provides customized follow-up care, with a focus on chronic diseases  . A similar approach was used by the AiCure app that uses a smartphone's camera and A.I. to confirm that patients are adhering to their prescriptions  . This could be useful for people with serious medical conditions or participants in clinical trials. A.I.-driven diagnostics:
 In 2020, the approved a software programme from the company Caption Health that allows medical professionals to perform cardiac ultrasound imaging without specialized training. It uses A.I. to provide real-time guidance and also the ability to save images of diagnostic quality. It acts as a ""co-pilot"" for those performing an ultrasound scan as it was designed to emulate the guidance that an expert sonographer would provide to optimize the image. It gives instructions on how to manipulate the transducer, and provides automated feedback on diagnostic image quality  . Mining medical records:
 Collecting, storing, normalizing, and tracking medical records is an obvious step for A.I. As an example, Google Deepmind Health is cooperating with the Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to improve eye treatment by analyzing retina scans. The images are analyzed by DeepMind's algorithms resulting in a detailed diagnosis and a so-called ""urgency score"" in about 30 s. The prototype system can detect diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration  . Precision medicine:
 The company Deep Genomics aims at identifying patterns in genetic data and medical records of patients trying to link mutations to medical conditions. Oncompass Medicine uses A.I.based algorithms to match genetic mutations found in patients' tumor samples with ongoing clinical trials worldwide. This way, patients can receive precisely targeted treatments specific to the kind of cancerous tissue they have. Precision medicine:
 Designing treatment plans IBM Watson developed a software that provides evidence-based treatment options for oncologists. It was designed to analyze both structured and unstructured data in medical records that may contribute to decision-making about treatment pathways. The software combines data from the patient's medical record with clinical expertise, and research papers to suggest promising treatment plans  . There are many similar examples in other specialties. Creating an optimized radiation therapy delivery plan usually takes days. A.I.-based technologies help speed this process, completing the process in a couple of minutes  . Drug creation:
 The way pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs through clinical trials can take several years and can cost billions of dollars. Speeding this up while making it more cost-effective would have an enormous effect on healthcare. The company Atomwise uses supercomputers to root out treatments from a database of molecular structures. They also launched a search for a previously unknown combination of safe and existing medicines and in a few days found two drugs predicted by the company's A.I. technology which may significantly reduce the infectivity of Ebola. Such analysis typically would have taken months or years  ."

 While AI in the US healthcare industry can pose potential cybersecurity risks, it serves as an important technological advancement for improving patient care such as monitoring diabetes and improving patient experience but important considerations should be made regarding the safe utilization, patient opinion, and development of artificial intelligence as it is used more in healthcare. Monitoring of Diabetes::
 An important aspect of AI in healthcare involves its use in diabetes treatment and care. One specific component of this is diabetic retinopathy (DR), which the National Institute of Health (NIH) defines as an eye condition that causes vision loss for diabetic patients (22). Monitoring of Diabetes::
 However, as Dr. Raman from the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology explains, diagnosis and intervention involve the screening of various images, which AI is often optimized for. Monitoring of Diabetes::
 While several algorithms have been developed, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an algorithm by iDx with 96% sensitivity and 88% specificity  As demonstrated by Figure , Artificial Intelligence performs significantly better in terms of cost, personalization, comfortability, sustainability, and scalability compared to traditional diagnosis and intervention. Monitoring of Diabetes::
 While not implemented fully in the US healthcare system, AI can be a powerful tool for saving lives and improving patient care, specifically for diabetes. Improving Patient Experience::
 AI can also be utilized to improve patient experiences significantly. Dr. Bohr continues that medical schools and hospitals can utilize Virtual Reality (VR) systems to train medical students, especially in surgery. When VR was utilized, students performed significantly better compared to their traditional counterparts. Improving Patient Experience::
 In addition, AI can be utilized to interact more effectively with patients and perform administrative tasks such as going through personal records and optimizing the laborious administrative process. All of such can reduce wait times and improve patient care dramatically (20). Improving Patient Experience::
 While such robust systems are not fully implemented in hospitals due to approval, efficacy, and AI biases, with important considerations, the use of AI is promising for the future. AI can also help patients interact with their surroundings."

The future capacity of AI might include using video-and audiocapture tools with facial or tonal interpretation for stress detection in the home or offi ce, or the incorporation of skin lesion detection apps into real-time video for dermatological visits. Using AI to Augment Primary Care Outside of the Clinical Encounter:
 In the last six years, there has been a signifi cant increase in the use of consumer applications for patient self-management of chronic diseases, and to a lesser degree for patient-provider shared management through home health care delivery and remote monitoring . Using AI to Augment Primary Care Outside of the Clinical Encounter:
 In 2018, diabetic care witnessed the landmark approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of IDx-DR, a ML-based algorithm that detects diabetic retinopathy, as the fi rst AI-driven medical device to not require physician interpretation . Outside the hospital, several AI applications have been developed for diabetes self-management, including those that have shown improvements in HgbA1c through AI analysis of photos of patient meals to assess calories and nutrients  and another pilot trial of fully automated coaching for prediabetics, showing decreases in weight and HgbA1c . For insulin management in type 1 diabetes, multiple studies have found that using selfadaptive learning algorithms in conjunction with con-tinuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps results in decreased rates of hypoglycemia and an increase in patients reaching their target glucose range . In March 2020 in the United Kingdom, the fi rst such tool was offi cially licensed and launched publicly . For type 2 diabetes, a promising example is an FDAapproved diabetes management system called Well-Doc that gives individualized feedback and recommendations on blood sugar management and has been shown to reduce HgbA1c levels signifi cantly . Using AI to Augment Primary Care Outside of the Clinical Encounter:
 Other consumer tools, some with approvals by regulatory agencies, help monitor and support blood pressure control and vital sign checks. One app, Binah.ai, features a validated tool that can scan a person's face in good lighting conditions and report heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation, and respiration with high levels of accuracy . In addition, an increasing number of AI virtual health and lifestyle coaches have been developed for weight management and smoking cessation. Remote Technology Monitoring for Promoting Cardiac Health:
 Wearable and remote monitoring technology can assist in ushering in the next era of health care data innovation by capturing physiologic data in HSOHC . In the current clinic-based paradigm, data is captured in isolated snapshots and often at infrequent time intervals. For example, blood pressure is measured and recorded during clinic visits once or twice a year, which Box 1 | Key Artifi cial Intelligence Terminology Defi nitions:

For 20 years, our team developed patient-communicating digital healthcare platforms and proved their efficacy. National scale randomized control trials are underway to systematically measure the efficacy and economic benefits of this digital health care system. Precision medicine aims to maximize effectiveness of disease management by considering individual variability. Digital health technologies enable precision medicine at a reasonable cost that was not available before. The government launched the “National Integrated Bio-big Data Project” which will collect diverse health data from the participants.

In summary, ICT increases communication accessibility between patients and healthcare providers, accelerating the advent of mobile healthcare. ICT-based diabetes care has been shown to be effective and cost-efficient. With national support, ICT-based primary care services for diabetes will largely expand. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND PRECISION MEDICINE IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES: Digital technology provides unprecedented quantity and quality of patient-generated health data (PGHD), accelerating the advent of precision medicine in diabetes care. Patients with diabetes share heterogeneous pathophysiology and phenotypes that require life-long individualized management . In 2015, former U.S. President Barack Obama announced the launch of the Precision Medicine Initiative . Since then, large-scale investments and actions have been undertaken to enable precision medicine. Precision medicine aims to predict the individual risk of developing various diseases and provide the most optimal therapy for those who already have diseases . To achieve this goal, it is important to understand how environmental and genetic factors and their interactions contribute to the development of diseases and understand the variation in individual responses to medical treatments . Each nation has organized large-scale cohorts to collect and analyze medical information and biological samples. National Institutes of Health in the U.S. initiated enrollment of a national cohort (""All of the US"") in 2018 to collect medical information (electronic health record), PGHD, and biological samples (DNA, metabolite, proteome). The cohort aims to engage >1 million participants, and approximately 35% of individuals were enrolled 2 years after the launch of the program . ""The Million Veteran Program"" directed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, is also under progress and has already enrolled 0.9 million participants . The U.K. biobank engaged 0.5 million participants, and further plans to pursue their project until the number of participants reaches 5 million . Finland organized ""FinnGen"" project in 2017 to enroll 0.5 million participants . China has also organized a national precision medicine project aimed at enrolling 1 million participants . One of the main hurdles in collecting data for largescale national cohorts is the integration of EMRs. EMRs were initially developed to efficiently share health information between physicians, patients, insurance companies, and researchers. However, integrating high-throughput EMR data remains challenging because of the diverse number of EMR platforms, the un-unified use of medical terminologies, and the lack of important patient information . Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have enabled us to deal with missing values and systematically analyze high volumes of EMR data . In addition, the ontological classification of medical records provides a link between heterogeneously described medical records and biologically meaningful phenotypes . Data security and storage are other important issues in integrating EMR data and adopting them in precision medicine . I have participated in ""The digital healthcare special committee belonging to the president committee fourth industrial revolution"" in South Korea and organized the ""My-Healthway"" system. ""My-Healthway"" enables each individual to store their personal health record (PHR) in a personal cloud or mobile smartphone (Fig. ) . As a result, each individual can take the initiative for integrating and managing their own medical data and transferring them to others, such as hospitals, government, insurance companies, and researchers, when necessary. The first service of ""My-Healthway"" was started in January 2021 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

 AI applications also facilitate the storage and analysis of patient information on EHR systems presenting it to the physician along with a sound understanding of patient's medical needs in less time. Results of these findings:
 This is saving physicians a great deal of time previously spent on deskwork and EHR systems giving them more time for physical presence with their patients. Results of these findings:
 AI has not only reduced the amount of physicians' deskwork and freed up their time for primary healthcare but also increased ingenuity, accuracy, and efficacy. Results of these findings:
 AI is also being used to find and develop new drugs and investigate the repurposing of existing drugs for use against specific diseases, as clinical trials are costly and time-consuming. AI is facilitating ""precision medicine"" as it can screen existing medications and suggest treatment targeted at individual patients. Results of these findings:
 AI can outperform dermatologists in classifying skin diseases accurately AI systems can learn from successive cases and can handle multiple cases efficiently in less time compared to human learning processes. Results of these findings:
 However, in some cases, AI-based decision-making approaches are not in agreement with the expert's opinion, such as identifying pulmonary tuberculosis on chest radiographs. The increased usage of AI technology has also reduced the number of job opportunities, which is a major concern for the health industry. Results of these findings:
 In addition, although human behavior can be translated by analytical and logical algorithms, it is difficult for machines to translate human attributes such as the ability to conceptualize, interactive and communication skills, sensitive intelligence, and creativity. Moreover, AI predictions are not always accurate. Results of these findings:
 In a study, 640,000 digital mammograms were reviewed in the Digital Mammography DREAM challenge with the help of several high-end processing computers. Results of these findings:
 The observed results were approximately equal to those of the bottom 10% of radiologists with a specificity of 0.81, sensitivity of 0.80, and area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) of 0.87. Results of these findings:
 It is evident, however, that AI will play a major role in the healthcare industry in the future and thus it is essential to train medical staff regarding its concepts and applicability. AI functions efficiently in a technology-based workspace to cultivate soft skills such as empathy in machines."

Erroneous information has negative implications for catastrophe preparedness and response. The actual crowd is represented by the data collected from multiple sources, which includes both purposeful and unintentional misleading data . Conclusions:
 We believe that AI will play a significant role in the healthcare industry. Precision medicine, which is widely known for much improvement in healthcare, is fueled by this capability. Though early attempts at diagnosis and therapy guidance proved challenging, we expect that AI can now master the domain as well. Thanks to significant improvements in AI for imaging science, many radiology and pathology images are projected to be evaluated by a device at some point. Voice and text analytics are increasingly used for tasks such as patient communication and diagnostic report collection, and this pattern is expected to continue. The most challenging challenge for AI in such health domains is maintaining its acceptance in ordinary clinical practice, rather than whether the technologies are competent enough to be effective. AI programs should be licensed by governing bodies, capable of EHR systems, standardized to the point that identical devices function in the same way, trained by physicians, financed by either public or commercial payers, and modified in the long run in the sector for universal acceptance to occur. These obstacles will be solved in the end, but they will require even more than that for the maturation of the technology itself. As a result, within the next five years, we expect to see minimal AI application in clinical practice, with more widespread use by the next decade. It can increase the productivity and efficiency of care delivery and allow healthcare systems to provide more and better care for more people. Compared to previously reported articles on AI, this review focused on the applications of AI in healthcare systems especially in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases (Table ). Based on the summarized data, it has been inferred that the AI can help in improving the knowledge of healthcare workers, enabling them to spend more time in direct patient care and reduce fatigue. Overall, we might conclude that the future of 'traditional medicine' may be closer than we think, with patients first seeing a computer and then a doctor."

Due to the progressive nature of the disease, earlier detection and timely treatment can lead to substantial reductions in the incidence of irreversible vision-loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) screening systems have offered clinically acceptable and quicker results in detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant investigations was performed to document the performance of AI screening systems that were applied to fundus and OCT images of patients from diverse geographic locations including North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. A systematic literature search on Medline, Global Health, and PubMed was performed and studies published between October 2015 and January 2020 were included. The search strategy was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, and AI-based investigations were mandatory for studies inclusion. The abstracts, titles, and full-texts of potentially eligible studies were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review; 18 met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of the evaluated AI screening systems in detecting diabetic retinopathy was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92-0.94) and the specificity was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.89). The included studies detailed training and external validation datasets, criteria for diabetic retinopathy case ascertainment, imaging modalities, DR-grading scales, and compared AI results to those of human graders (e.g., ophthalmologists, retinal specialists, trained nurses, and other healthcare providers) as a reference standard. The findings of this study showed that the majority AI screening systems demonstrated clinically acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus and OCT photographs. Further improvement depends on the continual development of novel algorithms with large and gradable sets of images for training and validation. If cost-effectiveness ratios can be optimized, AI can become a financially sustainable and clinically effective intervention that can be incorporated into the healthcare systems of low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) and geographically remote locations.

It is unclear whether participant data was included in multiple datasets, so the overall performance metrics may be underestimated or overestimated due to potential changes in said participants' severities of diabetic retinopathy between data sources. Conclusions:
 This review and meta-analysis demonstrates clinically acceptable performances from the majority AI systems used in diabetic retinopathy screening. Although the majority of neural networks showed clinically acceptable performance levels, further improvement depends on the continual development of novel algorithms with large and gradable sets of images for training and validation. With the rapidly growing global burden of diabetic retinopathy, AI screening systems can increase the ability for disease prevention by allowing for early detection. If cost-effectiveness ratios can be optimized, AI can become a financially sustainable and clinically effective intervention that can be incorporated into the healthcare systems of LMICs and geographically remote locations. AI screening can increase the efficiency of eye care and diabetes services and optimize the care of patients within healthcare systems that provide large-scale services on a population level. Combining screening technologies with treatment interventions such as anti-VEGF therapy, acellular capillary laser treatment, and vitreoretinal surgery can lead to substantial reductions in the incidence of irreversible vision-loss due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. With further advancement, AI will inform and improve primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings' approaches to diabetic retinopathy management."

To this purpose, we propose a ""digital twin"" of patients modeling the human body as a whole and providing a panoramic view over individuals' conditions. Methods: We propose a general framework that composes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and integrates mathematical modeling in order to provide a panoramic view over current and future pathophysiological conditions. Our modular architecture is based on a graph neural network (GNN) forecasting clinically relevant endpoints (such as blood pressure) and a generative adversarial network (GAN) providing a proof of concept of transcriptomic integrability. Results: We tested our digital twin model on two simulated clinical case studies combining information at organ, tissue, and cellular level. We provided a panoramic overview over current and future patient's conditions by monitoring and forecasting clinically relevant endpoints representing the evolution of patient's vital parameters using the GNN model. We showed how to use the GAN to generate multi-tissue expression data for blood and lung to find associations between cytokines conditioned on the expression of genes in the renin-angiotensin pathway. Our approach was to detect inflammatory cytokines, which are known to have effects on blood pressure and have previously been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., CXCR6, XCL1, and others). Significance: The graph representation of a computational patient has potential to solve important technological challenges in integrating multiscale computational modeling with AI. We believe that this work represents a step forward toward next-generation devices for precision and predictive medicine.",". This tool could also be complemented by clinical decision support systems such as . The complexly structured and multilevel comorbidity and frailty patterns of most diseases describe a highly dynamical system and are, therefore, challenging current medical therapies. AI for Evidence-Based Medicine:
 From a clinical standpoint, AI will support a plethora of different tasks from medical check up to personalized intervention strategies to contrast ripple effects or to promote healthy habits. In non-acute states, predictive inference will propose prevention plans for comorbidity management, particularly in presence of multiple therapies . Increasingly large amount of personal data will be collected to feed modular machine learning (ML) models organized to address specific and personalized medical issues. Clinical endpoints will be constantly monitored, shared, and compared in order to answer relevant research questions and to deliver the best possible service. A deeper understanding and practice of modeling in medicine will produce better investigation of complex biological processes, and even new ideas and better feedback into medicine. Modelingbased approaches combined with data-driven ML techniques will progressively provide models with higher degree of interpretability and generalization ability , which will make evidence-based medicine even more accessible intensifying the involvement of patients in the decision-making process. AI simulations forecasting the evolution of clinical endpoints over time will also reshape clinical guidelines , which will no longer be based just on horizontal population studies. Cross-modality data will be collected for each patient and machine learning models will be used to predict a bundle of possible trajectories representing the future states of the patient allowing for personalized prescriptions, surgical planning, and medical interventions. Social Impact:
 Ethical repercussions will also be huge . The transition will call for deeper transdisciplinary research and a substantial technological innovation in a variety of research and social areas. Here, education will play a key role in changing lifestyle habits and the way health is perceived, communicated, and delivered . For each individual, both healthcare systems and private companies will collect, save, and eventually exploit an enormous amount of personal data. Providing an effective, stable, and unified juridical overview is critical on this matter . Social Impact:
 4.2.6. Next-Generation Medical Devices AI will change the leading vehicle of medicine. The demand for AI-powered and internet of things (IoT) devices is increasing worldwide. The future equipment for precision medicine will likely required to be cheap and extremely modular, but more importantly it needs to be deployable in dedicated hardware to be distributed in larger markets. Our digital twin model aims at providing the first example of a novel class of AI-assisted tools for precision and predictive medicine. Our framework is designed to scale to medical device deployment and run time monitoring and verification combining ideas from systems medicine with scientific computing and machine learning. The integration of interpretable AI models in clinical devices may lead to a deep transformation in healthcare paving the way for a next generation of tools for precision medicine probing the inner workings of full body in well-being and disease conditions."

This article provides an overview of some of the ways telemedicine is improving diabetes care outcomes at the community level. Telemedicine can play a number of roles in moving quality diabetes care forward. It is currently being used to create awareness among urban and rural population about the risk factors and prevention of diabetes; to facilitate patient monitoring; for remote diabetic retinopathy screening; and in diabetes prevention at the primary, secondary, and tertiary level. We also highlight the use of automated artificial intelligence software combined with telemedicine to conduct efficient real-time screening of complications such as diabetic retinopathy in remote areas where such facilities are currently unavailable.","stand-alone diabetes telemedicine systems and hospital electronic medical records, inadequate data encryption and security systems to fully ensure patient privacy, and inadequate decision support software are some of the issues currently facing telemedicine programs, all of which obviously, need to be addressed. Conclusion:
 In low-and middle-income economies, innovative approaches, including telemedicine, mobile technology, internet, and websites, can be adapted to prevent and manage diabetes in the community. Using these technologies, clinicians can reach out to remote and underserved communities and serve patients at their doorstep. Conclusion:
 Telemedicine is a valuable, cost-effective and reliable tool for screening people with diabetes for various complications, and it provides people in rural areas access to many virtual ''super specialists'' in the field of medicine. As such, it holds great promise for enhancing the quality of care, improved access to care in remote areas, and prevention and detection of noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes. Conclusion:
 In summary, telemedicine bridges the gap between primary care and secondary/tertiary care. However, using this technology requires services of expert teams working collaboratively to provide care and follow-up. There is ample scope for telemedicine to improve diabetes care outcomes by reducing the rate of secondary complications in both developed and developing nations. Successful telemedicine-driven diabetic complication screening could reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications due to diabetes and, thereby, the health care burden. Conclusion:
 One could anticipate that the use of automated AI software combined with telemedicine could enable efficient real-time screening of complication like retinopathy in people with diabetes, in remote areas where such facilities are currently not available."

Increased knowledge of this condition has emerged from populations around the world, illuminating the differences in how diabetes presents, its variable prevalence, and how best practice in treatment varies between populations. In parallel, focus has been placed on the development of tools for the application of precision medicine to numerous conditions. This Consensus Report presents the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative in partnership with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), including its mission, the current state of the field, and prospects for the future. Expert opinions are presented on areas of precision diagnostics and precision therapeutics (including prevention and treatment), and key barriers to and opportunities for implementation of precision diabetes medicine, with better care and outcomes around the globe, are highlighted. Cases where precision diagnosis is already feasible and effective (i.e., monogenic forms of diabetes) are presented, while the major hurdles to the global implementation of precision diagnosis of complex forms of diabetes are discussed. The situation is similar for precision therapeutics, in which the appropriate therapy will often change over time owing to the manner in which diabetes evolves within individual patients. This Consensus Report describes a foundation for precision diabetes medicine, while highlighting what remains to be done to realize its potential.

Current diagnostic strategies are suboptimal for defining even the major diabetes categories. Summary and Future Perspectives:
 Despite an excellent diagnostic paradigm, there are no known avenues for prevention in monogenic diabetes. Similarly, there are no known ways to prevent T1D , although careful monitoring in high-risk individuals prevents complications at onset. Thus, precision prevention in T1D is likely to involve stratification of at-risk populations within which innovative monitoring technologies will be applied. In T2D, lifestyle factors play a dominant role, yet standardized preventive interventions have relatively low efficacy. Although both lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions can delay onset of diabetes in people at high-risk (e.g., those with obesity and impared glucose tolerance), completely preventing diabetes has proven challenging. Nevertheless, because lifestyle is paramount and there are such variable responses to lifestyle interventions, opportunities for precision prevention of T2D are perhaps most apparent, with some studies showing that tailoring diet to an individual's biological characteristics can help minimize postprandial glucose excursions . The scope and potential for precision treatment in diabetes is vast, yet deep understanding is lacking. For drug outcomes, there is a pressing need to move beyond early glycemic response and examine variation in response in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, mortality and other patient-centered outcomes, especially for the newer agents such as SGLT2i and GLP-1RA. It will be imperative to determine when and how the application of therapeutics in precision diabetes medicine improves outcomes in a cost-effective fashion. Summary and Future Perspectives:
 There are many important stakeholders whose engagement will be necessary for the implementation of precision diabetes medicine to succeed (Figure ). Progress in translating advances in biology and technology will be governed by the identification, accurate measurement and scalable deployment of agents for diagnosis and therapy, so broad stakeholder engagement is essential. It is crucial that precision approaches are available to the full diversity of human populations and societal contexts, such that precision diabetes medicine does not widen health disparity but achieves the greatest benefits to all individuals and society as a whole. Highly functional partnerships with patient representatives and public organizations will be required to reap the benefits of precision diabetes medicine. o Today, the objective of precision therapy is to maximize the probability that the best treatment of all those available is selected for a given patient. Summary and Future Perspectives:
 It is possible that in the future, precision diabetes medicines will be designed according to the biological features of specific patient subgroups, rather than for the patient population as a whole. o Precision monitoring can be achieved using digital apps, cutaneous or subcutaneous sensors, ingestible sensors, blood assays etc. Summary and Future Perspectives:
 o The intelligent processing, integration and interpretation of the data obtained through precision monitoring are key determinants of success o Precision monitoring may be valuable for precision prevention (e.g., in T1D), precision diagnostics (e.g., where diagnoses are based on timevarying characteristics) and precision prognostics (e.g., where disease trajectories are informative of the development of key outcomes)."

Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes according to the municipality registry were invited to attend nearby clinics for screening on designated days. Trained health-care technicians acquired images which were automatically evaluated by the system, with instant remote evaluation by retinal specialists in selected cases.Our study was based in Sergipe State, located at a region with high illiteracy rates and no local availability of specialized retina care. The average number of laser treatments performed annually in the last 5 years is 126, for a total State population of 2.3 million.Even though screening was performed free of charge in a convenient location for patients, from a total 2052 eligible individuals, only 1083 attended for screening.Efforts to raise awareness on the condition screened and to provide health education for patients and local health-care personnel are fundamental for increased attendance. Tailoring screening systems to the local setting, such as determining the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, is challenging in regions with no current benchmarks. Standards for retinopathy screening based on the strategies adopted by high-income countries may not be realistic in low- and middle-income countries.Le système de santé publique brésilien ne possède à ce jour ni stratégie nationale, ni approche standardisée pour le dépistage de la rétinopathie diabétique, et de nombreux obstacles socioéconomiques entravent l'accès à des examens ophtalmologiques dans les régions les plus défavorisées du Brésil.Entre septembre 2021 et mars 2022, nous avons mené un projet pilote où l'intelligence artificielle était intégrée dans une caméra rétinienne portable afin de dépister la rétinopathie diabétique. Les patients souffrant de diabète, selon le registre de la municipalité, ont été invités à se rendre dans les cliniques des environs pour un dépistage lors de journées prévues à cet effet. Les images réalisées par des techniciens de santé qualifiés ont été automatiquement évaluées par le dispositif et, dans certains cas, soumises à des spécialistes de la rétine pour examen.Notre étude s'est déroulée dans l'État de Sergipe, une région où le taux d'analphabétisme est élevé et qui ne dispose d'aucun établissement proposant une prise en charge des maladies rétiniennes.

El promedio de tratamientos con láser realizados al año en los últimos 5 años es de 126, para una población total del estado de 2,3 millones.A pesar de que el cribado se realizó de forma gratuita en un lugar conveniente para los pacientes, de un total de 2052 personas que cumplían los requisitos, solo 1083 acudieron al cribado.Para aumentar la asistencia, es fundamental realizar esfuerzos de sensibilización sobre la enfermedad que se estudia y proporcionar educación sanitaria a los pacientes y al personal sanitario local. La adaptación de los sistemas de cribado al entorno local, como la determinación del equilibrio entre la sensibilidad y la especificidad, es un reto en las regiones que carecen de puntos de referencia actuales. Los estándares para el cribado de la retinopatía a partir de las estrategias que adoptan los países de ingresos altos pueden no ser realistas en los países de ingresos bajos y medios.لا توجد حاليًا استراتيجية وطنية أو أسلوب قياسي لفحص اعتلال الشبكية السكري في نظام الصحة العامة البرازيلي، وهناك العديد من الحواجز الاجتماعية والاقتصادية التي تمنع الخضوع لفحص العين في المناطق الأكثر فقرًا في البرازيل.من سبتمبر/أيلول 2021 إلى مارس/آذار 2022، قمنا بتنفيذ مشروع تجريبي باستخدام نظام ذكاء اصطناعي لفحص اعتلال الشبكية السكري، مدمج في كاميرا شبكية محمولة. المرضى الذين تم تشخيص إصابتهم بمرض السكري وفقًا لسجل البلدية، تمت دعوتهم للحضور للعيادات القريبة للخضوع للفحص في أيام مقررة. حصل فنيو الرعاية الصحية المدربون على صور تم تقييمها أوتوماتيكيًا بواسطة النظام، مع تقييم فوري عن بُعد بواسطة متخصصين في شبكية العين في حالات مختارة.اتخذت دراستنا من ولاية سيرغيبي مركزًا لها، والواقعة في منطقة ترتفع فيها معدلات الأمية ولا تتوفر رعاية محلية متخصصة لشبكية العين. متوسط عدد العلاجات بالليزر التي تم إجراؤها سنويًا في آخر 5 سنوات هو 126، لإجمالي عدد سكان الولاية البالغ 2.3 مليون نسمة.على الرغم من إجراء الفحص مجانًا في مكان مناسب للمرضى، فمن إجمالي 2052 فردًا مؤهلاً، حضر 1083 فردًا فقط للفحص.إن الجهود المبذولة لزيادة الوعي بالحالة التي يتم فحصها، وتوفير التوعية الصحية للمرضى وموظفي الرعاية الصحية المحليين، تعتبر مطلبًا أساسيًا لزيادة الحضور. إن تصميم أنظمة الفحص وفقًا للمواقع المحلية، مثل تحديد المقايضة بين الحساسية والنوعية، يمثل تحديًا صعبًا في المناطق التي لا توجد بها معايير حالية. إن معايير فحص اعتلال الشبكية القائمة على الاستراتيجيات المعتمدة في الدول ذات الدخل المرتفع، قد لا تكون واقعية في الدول ذات الدخل المنخفض والدخل المتوسط.巴西公共卫生系统目前没有针对糖尿病视网膜病变筛查的国家战略或标准化方法，而且多种社会经济障碍阻碍了巴西最贫困地区进行眼科检查。.从 2021 年 9 月到 2022 年 3 月，我们开展了一个试点项目，将人工智能系统嵌入便携式视网膜摄像头，以便进行糖尿病视网膜病变筛查。市政登记处中诊断为糖尿病的患者被邀请在指定日期到附近的诊所参加筛查。训练有素的医疗技术人员获取系统自动评估的图像，视网膜专科医生对所选病例进行即时远程评估。.我们研究的对象是塞尔希培州，该州文盲率高，当地没有专门的视网膜护理服务。该州总人口 230 万，但在过去 5 年中，每年进行激光治疗的平均次数为 126 次。.尽管是在便于患者前往的地点免费进行筛查，但在 2052 名符合筛查条件的人中，只有 1083 人参加了筛查。.应努力提高人们对筛查疾病的认识，并为患者和当地卫生保健人员提供健康教育，这是提高筛查率的基础。结合当地状况量身制定筛查系统，例如，如何在当前没有基准的地区对敏感性和特异性进行权衡，这便是一项挑战。将高收入国家采用的视网膜筛查战略作为标准，对于中低收入国家来说可能并不实际。.В настоящее время в системе общественного здравоохранения Бразилии не существует национальной стратегии или стандартизированного подхода к скринингу на диабетическую ретинопатию, а многочисленные социально-экономические барьеры препятствуют доступу к офтальмологическому обследованию в беднейших регионах Бразилии.С сентября 2021 г. по март 2022 г. авторы реализовали экспериментальный проект с использованием системы искусственного интеллекта для скрининга на диабетическую ретинопатию, которая была встроена в портативную ретинальную камеру. Пациентов с диагнозом «диабет», чьи соответствующие данные были упомянуты в муниципальном реестре, приглашали посетить близлежащие клиники для проведения скрининга в назначенные дни. Обученные технические работники здравоохранения получали изображения, которые система автоматически оценивала, а в отдельных случаях ретинологи проводили мгновенную дистанционную оценку.Данное исследование проводилось в штате Сержипи, расположенном в регионе с высоким уровнем неграмотности и отсутствием специализированной офтальмологической помощи на местном уровне. Ежегодно за последние 5 лет здесь выполнялось в среднем 126 лазерных офтальмологических процедур при общей численности населения штата в 2,3 миллиона человек.Несмотря на то что скрининг проводился бесплатно в удобном для пациентов месте, из 2052 человек, соответствующих критериям, только 1083 человека посетили скрининг.Усилия, направленные на повышение осведомленности о подлежащем скринингу заболевании и медико-санитарное просвещение пациентов и местного медицинского персонала, имеют основополагающее значение для повышения посещаемости. Адаптация систем скрининга к местным условиям, например определение компромисса между чувствительностью и специфичностью, является сложной задачей в регионах, где нет действующих контрольных показателей. Стандарты скрининга на ретинопатию, основанные на стратегиях, принятых в странах с высоким уровнем дохода, могут оказаться нереалистичными в странах с низким и средним уровнем дохода. ","screening results to patients was related to better adherence to followup appointments. The real success of artificial intelligence systems is related not only to the diagnostic accuracy but also to real improvement in the health of the population. Further studies are necessary to evaluate such outcomes. Lessons learnt:
 Ensuring subsequent specialized care is important for those patients identified by the screening programme and it is also necessary to consider the ability of the community health-care system to accommodate the additional numbers of patients identified.  Underserved areas already lack sufficient treatment coverage, and the systematic identification of new cases of diabetic retinopathy will certainly increase the demand for treatment in the early phases of the programme. Our initiative included advocacy directed at the local health authorities for the adoption and implementation of a cost-effective model for the screening of diabetic retinopathy, with the aim of attaining financial sustainability for the programme. Other ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, Box 1. Summary of main lessons learnt:
 • Raising awareness about diabetic retinopathy among patients and local health-care workers is essential for increased attendance and the overall success of screening initiatives. • Tailoring screening systems to the local setting, such as determining the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, is challenging in regions with no current benchmarks. • Cost considerations are essential for the sustainability of diabetic retinopathy programmes; Box 1. Summary of main lessons learnt:
 health outcome metrics should be sought to evaluate the impact of such programmes. Lessons from the field:
 Artificial intelligence for diabetic retinopathy screening, Brazil Fernando Korn Malerbi & Gustavo Barreto Melo such as non-maleficence (the expert over-reading of all images not to miss false negatives) and the promotion of equity (diagnosis and treatment were offered to all eligible patients free of charge) were also elements of the initiative. Lessons from the field:
 Finally, incomplete data and the lack of representative data sets in the development of artificial intelligence may lead to bias. Public data sets of diabetic retinopathy images represent samples from only seven countries, leaving most of the global population unrepresent-ed.  Of note, the screening system used in the present initiative was previously validated with a similar sample from a neighbouring state in Brazil.  In conclusion, our experience with an artificial intelligence system for prevention of diabetic blindness highlights challenges that are certainly shared by other low-and middle-income countries. Each country will make choices when deciding on public health screening strategies; decisions will be made in the political sphere, after legislative debates, or following scientific guide-lines, for example. We believe that a strategy involving scientific societies or multilateral forums can determine the characteristics of the artificial intelligence system, standardized protocols and key quality metrics. The aim would be to maximize outcomes in a costeffective and successful manner, given the available resources to ensure the sustainability of such efforts. "

Patients and methods Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods. Results Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like ""Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent ... The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible."" There are two approaches to name this technology - ""Artificial intelligence"" and ""Augmented Intelligence."" We prefer to use a more common category of ""Artificial intelligence"" rather than ""Augmented Intelligence"" because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for ""human supervision"" meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, ""calculator""), AI as an entity with some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human's activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare's Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field - smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches - flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns. Conclusion Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation.","erences of collected data; the possibility of medical exceptions in some types of diseases; lack of explanation and inability to substitute the role of the physician. Such a method can undoubtedly be practically implemented, but the scope of such implementation should not be overestimated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 ""Decision-making method"" is grounded on the mathematical algorithms of creating decisions under some level of uncertainty, involving prior experience, manifestations, likelihoodness, and outcomes. As P. Szolovits rightly notes, ""Besides its rationality, such an approach has some issues regarding obtaining reasonable estimates of probabilities and utilities for a particular analysis. Although techniques such as sensitivity analysis help greatly to indicate which potential inaccuracies are unimportant, the lack of adequate data o en forces arti cial simpli cations of the problem and lowers con dence in the outcome of the analysis"".  For instance, such an approach could lead to a situation when multiple symptoms are considering as a mix of single diseases (when, in fact, they are a combination leading to one) or vice versa. Additionally, numeric algorithmic representation of the decision-making process obviously di ers from that of a real human-physician, which could confuse the patient. us, every single approach is suitable but not universal, moreover, as was mentioned before, despite the fact of the relatively long story of AI, we can admit that it is just a starting point of the technology in general and its use in healthcare in particular. According to recent researches, ""While there are widespread questions on what is real in AI in healthcare today, this report looked at 23 applications in use today and provides case studies of 14 applications already in use. ese illustrate the full range of areas where AI can have an impact: from apps that help patients manage their care themselves, to online symptom checkers and e-triage AI tools, to virtual agents that can carry out tasks in hospitals, to a bionic pancreas to help patients with diabetes. ""  It is predicted that we will face three main phases of AI in healthcare scaling: low-level technical implementation phase, when AI will be assisting in repetitive administrative tasks. At this point, AI technology will reduce the accompanying workload (not the main one) of the medical sta of all levels and image-based application of AI in ophthalmology, radiology . home-based care phase, when the assistance of AI will make it possible to switch the model of medical treatment more toward remote monitoring, alerting visual assistance on the basis of AI technology. Additionally, advancing will take place in AI utilization in oncology, cardiology, neurology, where it shows its rst forms of implementation these days  with broader digitalization combinations (by deep learning, NLP, connectivity) and organizational transformation in accompanying existing technologies."

Discussion: Subsequent studies should aim to develop inclusive AI models that synthesize genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variations, thereby preventing algorithmic bias and ensuring fair diabetes care. Challenges and future directions:
 The implementation of AI-driven precision medicine in T2D is hindered by generalizability challenges, as models often overlook the heterogeneity of the population in terms of genetic and socioeconomic determinants, which risks biased outcomes . Challenges and future directions:
 Algorithmic bias poses a threat to amplify health inequalities, especially in diabetes management, where underrepresented populations, such as ethnic minorities or low-income groups, can result in biased predictions . Challenges and future directions:
 Bias emerges from incomplete data that do not include cultural, linguistic, genetic, or environmental differences in underserved populations, and this amplifies disparities in low-and middle-income countries . Challenges and future directions:
 Thus, multiple datasets and fairaware algorithms are necessary, along with open science methodologies to counteract bias in the form of transparent data sharing and diverse model training . Data privacy takes precedence in the face of evolving regulations, which require safe storage and encryption to protect sensitive health information. Challenges and future directions:
 This is particularly important for AI systems managing diabetes, as they often handle large patient datasets that are susceptible to breaches . Challenges and future directions:
 Further, the integration of AI in India's healthcare system is being hindered by limited digital infrastructure and expensive solutions, particularly in rural regions, where access to highquality data and computing resources remains uneven . Challenges and future directions:
 Additional challenges include device interoperability, ethical considerations in algorithmic decision-making, and the need for adaptable regulatory frameworks to ensure the safe deployment of these technologies . Federated learning can promote generalizability and privacy by having models learn from decentralized data without sharing data centrally. Challenges and future directions:
 This facilitates collaborative development of AI across institutions while maintaining the confidentiality of patients with diabetes . Explainable AI can advance trust by making predictions transparent, allowing clinicians to comprehend model choices in real-time, such as during glucose monitoring or complication prediction. Challenges and future directions:
 These methods should be confirmed in the future in India to enable equitable, scalable diabetes management, with an emphasis on longitudinal research, integration with patient-oriented systems, and the remediation of disparities through personalized, AI-based interventions. Conclusions:
 In this study, we have investigated the use of AI for managing diabetes, with a special emphasis on incorporating CGM data and the distinctive phenotypic features of T2D in the Indian population. Conclusions:
 By using big data, AI instruments can identify high-risk subjects for developing diabetes, who can then be treated early and develop personalized treatment plans that incorporate genetic, lifestyle, and environmental determinants. Conclusions:
 Consequently, most AI-driven tools and technologies that support personalized medicine are focused on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of individuals. Moreover, by addressing these challenges, AI holds the potential to revolutionize diabetes management, offering more effective and personalized care and ultimately improving patient outcomes on a global scale."

 The integration of AI with healthcare has several advantages, they are as follows: However, the following issues are a concern: Finally, it makes patients satisfied and benefits them through fast, precise and inexpensive treatment. Areas of Implementations:
 AI is applying in many fields of medicine but with specific focus on diagnosis services. AI can perform the diagnosis of diseases on patient records and scan images including MRI just as effectively, if not more, than a doctor. Areas of Implementations:
 Also, patient treatment advice can be customized through genetic details given by the patient . AI chatbots and virtual assistants increase administrative productivity as they are responsible for schedules and handling nonemergent queries . Areas of Implementations:
 AI also specifically assists in the discovery of new drugs based on assessment of molecular data and literature content. Moreover, AI applies in telehealth through remote patient monitoring, and personalized care. Areas of Implementations:
 Nonetheless, there is still a clear belief among GPs that patient privacy needs to be protected, AI's working sensitive to patients, their data, and the treatment process should be transparent; the data being used for beneficial or nefarious purposes needs to be clarified, and so on. Recent Advancement:
 Research shows that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has improved in recent years especially in diagnosis. Recent Advancement:
 Advanced picture interpretation techniques mean that AI could be used to identify for instance tumours, pneumonia or diabetic retinopathy from X-rays and MRI with the same or better precision as that of radiologists . Recent Advancement:

The advent of advanced computing tools, such as AI, ML etc., has significantly augmented the capabilities within the industry and is making this industry future ready. The healthcare industry has been reactive, i.e. it treats individuals after they get the disease; however, with the application of the latest tools, the healthcare industry is becoming more predictive, i.e. it can predict the risk profile. This is the most significant impact advanced tools have brought to this industry. Advanced computing tools are being applied to multiple functions across the industry, such as drug development, patient treatment, diagnosis, insurance reimbursement etc. As there are multitudes of applications projecting different kinds of benefits, it becomes essential that we have a tool or framework which can measure the impact. This study aimed to develop a framework to evaluate the benefits of implementing these advanced computing tools. The primary objective of this technology application should be to impact the primary outcomes, i.e. accessibility, speed and accuracy, patient compliance and affordability. We must have a framework that objectively assesses the impact and provides guidance to all the stakeholders. This paper proposes a novel 4A framework to help all stakeholders assess the effects. The central idea in healthcare is to improve a patient's life. One can do that by making medicines more productive, reducing adverse effects, improving predictability, reducing cost, improving access etc. This paper provides a strategic framework to assess the impact on the suitable parameters. Novel 4A framework measures the effect on these critical parameters, i.e. access, accuracy, affordability and adherence. As this industry touches patient's life, there are multiple concerns and the primary amongst them, especially for the technology applications, are the ones related to legal and ethical. The overall archetype proposed in this research paper takes into account and provides a framework for the impact assessment. The novel 4A framework presented in this article will serve as a tool to evaluate the impact advanced computing tools will have on the healthcare industry. ","great help as many patient-physician interactions happened online, and routine healthcare was delivered via various online tools. Telemedicine has also helped in storing medical data, as all the data is stored on computers and retrieval, and access is effortless 34 . Access to Medicines:
 Technology can potentially improve the healthcare ecosystem by improving access to medicines  . However, the availability of drugs could be a challenge, especially in remote areas which need better road connectivity. Recently, drones have been used to deliver medicines to distant places. For example, in Africa, drones were used to deliver drugs. Also, in India, a few states discuss drone usage for supplying vaccines and other essential drugs  . Access to Surgeons:
 The potential of artificial intelligence in surgical procedures is vast  . Using AI, surgeons could perform complex surgeries without being present at the site. Another way by which technology can improve access is the use of robotics to conduct surgeries. Recently in Ahmedabad, India, heart surgery was conducted remotely by Dr Tejas Patel. Both the patient and surgeon were at a different locations, and the surgery was performed remotely using a robotic assembly  . Access to Surgeons:
 If this trend continues, then global experts can conduct surgeries anywhere in the world. This will improve access, as patients will not have to travel to other countries. A2. ACCURACY:
 Artificial intelligence can significantly improve the accuracy of diagnosis and early detection/prognosis  . AI has been used to improve the predictability of various diseases. Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated that one can detect diabetic retinopathy using retinal fundus photographs. In a study with 9963 and 1748 images, the algorithm had a high sensitivity and specificity towards detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. In this study, optimization was done for a particular type of neural network which could classify the images and predict diabetic retinopathy. Examples like these validate the promise of technology in improving the speed and accuracy of detecting various diseases  . Technology such as deep learning can predict the disease early and make an interconnection between the two conditions. In a study done by google and its subsidiary Verily  , they demonstrated that deep learning could be used to predict the risk of CV disease using a retinal scan. In disorders related to the cardiovascular system, such as MI (myocardial infarction) and angina, expecting early could be of immense value, as one can take necessary precautions. Currently, to predict CV risk for a patient, one needs to look at risk factors such as high cholesterol, blood pressure, age, smoking history, weight etc .  . Predicting CV risk through an eye scan is a significant advancement in technology. In a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic, AI algorithms were used to identify patients with weak heart pumps. In a study conducted over six months, 125,610 ECGs were analyzed using an AI algorithm and predicted the CV risk 41 A3. ADHERENCE:
 Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, cancer and respiratory are increasing globally due to lifestyle and other factors  . Also, life expectancy is increasing due to improved healthcare standards  . Multiple studies have shown the importance of medication adherence to improve clinical outcomes. AI tools such as patient reminder systems, health records, and outcome tracking can help enhance disease outcomes. AI-assisted devices can also help improve patientdoctor interaction and disease management  ."
"The Role of Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) in Telehealth: A New Frontier of Smart Healthcare Delivery in India","https://scispace.com/paper/the-role-of-ayushman-bharat-health-account-abha-in-2nybok61","2023","Posted Content","","","10.21203/rs.3.rs-2961416/v1","https://scispace.com/pdf/the-role-of-ayushman-bharat-health-account-abha-in-2nybok61.pdf","Abstract This paper draws attention to the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA), which constitutes a pivotal element of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) implemented in India. The ABHA database functions as a centralised repository of health-related information, offering a platform for IEC initiatives aimed at increasing awareness, encouraging healthy behaviours, and disseminating public health messaging. The integration of Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has the potential to augment patient education and engagement, streamline disease prevention initiatives, and enhance health literacy. Centralized health data can help in promoting telehealth by providing health care providers with access to patient medical records, enabling them to provide remote consultations and treatments. Exploring the function of Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) in telehealth for sustainable development necessitates an interdisciplinary view of healthcare delivery in India. Telehealth, which is the use of technology to provide remote healthcare services, can increase the reach and efficacy of ABHA. The adoption and success of ABHA and telehealth in India are influenced by numerous social, economic, technological, and policy-related factors, which can be identified through an interdisciplinary research approach. Such research can inform the development of a sustainable healthcare system that capitalizes on the strengths of ABHA and telehealth to enhance the population's health and well-being in India. This paper proposes the implementation of ABHA, IEC, AI, and telehealth in India, which have the potential to transform healthcare delivery by augmenting patient care, strengthening disease prevention efforts, and encouraging healthy lifestyles. This approach can potentially save lives and reduce healthcare costs in the long run. However, the implementation of such a system may raise concerns over privacy and data security, especially in a country with a large population and limited resources for enforcing regulations and protecting sensitive information. ","risks and limitations associated with its use. A balanced approach that incorporates both technology and clinical judgement is likely the most effective approach to healthcare decision-making. Additionally, steps should be taken to ensure the privacy and security of patient data throughout the predictive analytics process. Personalized Medicine:
 AI algorithms may not be as effective for certain demographics or patient populations due to bias in the data used to train them. For example, if the data is primarily from male patients, the algorithm may have di culty selecting appropriate treatments for women. This can result in inadequate or even harmful medical care for these populations. Therefore, it is important to ensure that AI algorithms used in personalized medicine are trained on diverse and representative data sets to avoid bias and provide effective medical care for all patients. Additionally, healthcare professionals should be aware of these limitations and work to address them through personalized and patient-centered care. Resource Optimization:
 The use of AI in resource optimization can also lead to unintended consequences. For example, if AI algorithms are not properly calibrated or trained on biased data, they may perpetuate existing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. Additionally, there is a risk that AI may be used to replace human decision-making entirely, leading to a loss of empathy and personalized care for patients. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that AI is developed and implemented ethically and with careful consideration of its potential impact on healthcare systems and patients. By leveraging the bene ts of AI while mitigating its risks, we can optimize resources and improve healthcare outcomes for all. Remote Monitoring:
 AI-powered remote monitoring may exacerbate health disparities. Patients with limited access to technology or reliable internet may not be able to take advantage of these tools, further widening the healthcare gap between a uent and underserved communities. Additionally, some patients may feel uncomfortable sharing sensitive health information with AI algorithms, which could negatively impact their willingness to participate in remote monitoring programs. In conclusion, while AI-powered remote monitoring has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, it is important to consider its potential impact on health disparities. Efforts should be made to ensure that all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status, have access to these tools and feel comfortable participating in remote monitoring programs. This will require a collaborative effort from healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology companies to address the underlying issues of inequality and ensure equitable access to healthcare for all. Disease Detection:
 There is a risk of bias in the data used for disease detection as certain populations, such as those with lower incomes or limited access to healthcare, may not be represented in centralized health data. This can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and disparities in healthcare outcomes for marginalized communities. Therefore, it is important to address and overcome these biases in order to ensure equitable and effective disease detection and healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or access to healthcare. This can be achieved through the collection and integration of diverse and representative data, as well as the implementation of targeted interventions to address disparities in healthcare access and outcomes."

The twenty-first century data science landscape may propel new alternative models for the evolution of our field. The imaging data-centric moonshot for global health may look like this: A data oriented moonshot:
 In 20 years, we will (a) expand access to imaging by a factor of 10, (b) witness > 100 startup companies utilizing raw medical image data come to fruition, and (c) deliver care to > 1 million nuclear medicine patients using AI networks trained with > 1 million data sets (d) throughout > 100 countries. This moonshot aims to foster a stewardship of data that incorporates a modern vision of its use. Importantly, this proposal allows cost reductions, viable through expanded access, through cultivation of an innovation landscape that encourages scalable technology development and application. Closing remarks:
 The biggest hurdle to evolution towards medical imaging data democratization across the field may be intellectual inertia. There is a famous quotation attributed the Willie Sutton, an American bank robber in the early twentieth century. When asked why he robbed banks, he replied concisely ""I rob banks because that's where the money is."" Closing remarks:
 New roles around data leadership are emerging because that is where the opportunity is. Our diligence now can impact the shape and reach of medicine for coming generations. Literature discussing the unique opportunities in embracing open science and democratization of data is already plentiful. Many industries are moving towards open access, valuation of data, expanding opportunities for inclusion, and transcending bottlenecks across uses of data. The field of nuclear medicine is well suited to provide leadership for change: our images are rich with meaningful data, and we already have extensive experience in cohesively integrating a variety of specialists. As new landscapes of opportunity for data-driven innovation open, we can lead by becoming stewards of imaging data, opening access to its highest fidelity embodiment, and promoting principles of accessibility and free market competition in the data use space. Closing remarks:
 To close with a metaphor, the wind of change is blowing, it would be a shame not to take the opportunity to reposition our sails."

It provides a visual documentation, a permanent record for the patients, and most importantly the ability to extract information about many diseases. Ophthalmology is a field that is heavily dependent on the analysis of digital images because they can aid in establishing an early diagnosis even before the first symptoms appear. This dissertation contributes to the digital analysis of such images and the problems that arise along the imaging pipeline, a field that is commonly referred to as retinal image analysis. We have dealt with and proposed solutions to problems that arise in retinal image acquisition and longitudinal monitoring of retinal disease evolution. Specifically, non-uniform illumination, poor image quality, automated focusing, and multichannel analysis. However, there are many unavoidable situations in which images of poor quality, like blurred retinal images because of aberrations in the eye, are acquired. To address this problem we have proposed two approaches for blind deconvolution of blurred retinal images. In the first approach, we consider the blur to be space-invariant and later in the second approach we extend the work and propose a more general space-variant scheme.&#x0D; For the development of the algorithms we have built preprocessing solutions that have enabled the extraction of retinal features of medical relevancy, like the segmentation of the optic disc and the detection and visualization of longitudinal structural changes in the retina. Encouraging experimental results carried out on real retinal images coming from the clinical setting demonstrate the applicability of our proposed solutions.

 In this thesis we have always pursued the application of our algorithms on real life sets of data chiefly originating from the clinical practice itself and not obtained under controlled experimental conditions. Everything Becomes Digital:
 This is a much Introduction more demanding challenge, but it is the one needed at present if automated retinal analysis is to become a reality in the clinical practice. Present Concerns:
 The recent paper by ) deals with the present concerns in the field. It combines input from 14 international research groups on the validation of automated retinal image analysis. This work demonstrates the international efforts being put to translating the research findings to the clinical practice in an effective way. Present Concerns:
 The authors described several scenarios in which algorithms for retinal image analysis are being used. Present Concerns:
 • Screening/monitoring, e.g. retinal diseases like DR. The goal is to identify images showing signs of a target condition in large sets. The images (patients) selected are referred for clinical attention. It has been shown that appropriate screening of DR is cost-effective . Present Concerns:
 Diabetic retinopathy screening facilitates early detection of patients with mild stages of DR, and thus early intervention. Automated screening promises to eliminate inefficiencies within the current DR screening workflow by providing a faster, more cost-effective and accurate disease diagnosis. Present Concerns:
 • Computer-assisted diagnosis and risk stratification. The purpose is to detect the presence or likelihood of a disease from specific signs. Automated retinal image analysis performance must be demonstrated to be more precise than diagnosis in the absence of computer assistance, or generate richer data improving a clinician's diagnosis. Present Concerns:
 • Biomarkers discovery. Aimed to determine whether the occurrence of measurable features in retinal images is linked significantly (in a statistical sense) with specific outcomes or conditions that impact treatment decisions, prognosis, or diagnosis. Present Concerns:
 In addition, ) also identify three areas that would further benefit from reliable automated retinal image analysis. Present Concerns:
 • Longitudinal studies. The purpose is to provide a means to study quantitatively the evolution and characterization of the disease, to assist treatment planning or gauging patient response to a treatment. Present Concerns:
 • Computer-aided or image-guided surgery. An emergent application of retinal image analysis algorithms , e.g. vitreoretinal microsurgery, for which image analysis allows registration of intra-operative imagery with pre-operative imagery for image-guided surgical interventions . Aim of the thesis:
 • Tele-health. Disease screening and monitoring could play a very important role here, e.g. in less developed countries where the incidence of diabetes is rising and screening made difficult by the lack of resources and clinicians . Computer-assisted telehealth programs can become a scalable method for providing expert care. Aim of the thesis:
 The different scenarios in which retinal image analysis is useful lead to a number of technological and scientific challenges, many of which arise from the attempts to automate or improve a procedure, to decentralize resources, etc."

 Precision health is described as the ability to assess disease risks at an individual level, detect early preclinical conditions, and initiate preventive strategies . Precision health refers to personalized health care based on a person's unique genetic, genomic, or omics composition within the context of lifestyle, social, economic, cultural, and environmental influences to help individuals achieve well-being and optimal health . As a field of research, it is still being delineated in relation to other fields such as precision medicine , while at the same time giving rise to other research concepts that it may actually encompass, such as precision public health . In this manner, the scope of precision health is broader than that of precision medicine, by including strategies for health promotion and disease prevention that occur outside the setting of health care institutions, which can be widely adopted . Thus, precision health strives to match promotion, prevention, diagnostic, and treatment interventions with genetic, biological, environmental, and social and behavioral determinants of health in a more person-centered manner . Precision health, in a nutshell, entails shifting the focus from treatment to promoting health and preventing the onset of diseases. Overview:
 Precision health, an evolution of precision medicine, combines genetic and genomic sequence, protein, metabolite, and microbiome information collectively known as ""omics"" with lifestyle, social, economic, cultural, and environmental factors . Overview:
 Precision health applications often combine more than one data source to assess risks and diagnose and initiate preventative interventions, including biological, genetic, environmental, social, and lifestyle-related measurements or observations. Although combining clinical-and community-based health data sources has not yet been established as necessary to fall within the realm of precision health, the field does provide the theoretical basis to amalgamate precision medicine and the social determinants of health (SDOH)  within the same interventions. This ambitious approach to health includes dynamic linkages between the research and practice of medicine, economics, population health, and public health . Overview:
 Digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are playing an increasing role in precision health. AI systems are partially or wholly autonomous machine-based systems that can, using statistical and mathematical modeling techniques for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or digital environments . A recent review has identified few studies on machine learning techniques that promote behavioral changes and physical or mental health . AI-based health technologies are rapidly entering the precision health domain outside the clinical setting. Examples of such technologies include screening and early detection devices and applications, health tracking applications, and mobile devices that support healthy living and improve chronic diseases management. In many cases, such technologies are integrated into devices where precision health was not the primary function or purpose. This may affect both the reliability and accuracy of, but also access to, precision health strategies. Some scholars have highlighted the potential of AI-based interventions in integrating the SDOH and precision medicine to improve overall population health ."

Reading articles in different media even the highest ranking medical journals it is easy to get the impression that this is powerful stuff; the future is promising and the real challenge is if computers (and robots) will turn out morally sound or not, or even turn against their human creators. In the field of medicine, some understand this as a saviour and that computer algorithms, such as those represented by Google’s AlphaGo Zero and IBM’s Watson, are the future diagnosticians and maybe even clinicians. However, there is a huge catch to this optimistic (or frightening) worldview. The catch is usually omitted, or barely touched upon in these articles. These systems are dependent on information and often lots of information (e.g., Big Data). Nevertheless, the systems outcomes will, still, never be better than their inputs. If their inputs are flooded with noise and unstructured and unspecified variables, it will be increasingly difficult for the systems to disentangle the true underlying patterns. In clinical medicine, structured and standardized data are rare. Having an entire electronic medical record (EMR) in this structured and standardized way is even rarer. Thus, developing diagnostic or treatment algorithms based on these records might seem futile, especially for those colleagues who believe that natural language processing (NLP) will solve this problem. Here, it should be remembered that EMR is a cornucopia of noisy text and language specific challenges for most countries in the world.

Authors: Lars-Petter Granan (Corresponding Author) Keywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), co-morbidity, complex adaptive systems, diagnostic and treatment algorithms, electronic medical record (EMR), person-centered healthcare, precision medicine, preferences, robotics, systems outcomes, values Introduction:
 Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in precision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI) and the jungle of methods they entail. Reading articles in different media -even the highest ranking medical journals -it is easy to get the impression that this is powerful stuff; the future is promising and the real challenge is if computers (and robots) will turn out morally sound or not, or even turn against their human creators. In the field of medicine, some understand this as a saviour and that computer algorithms, such as those represented by Google's AlphaGo Zero and IBM's Watson, are the future diagnosticians and maybe even clinicians. However, there is a huge catch to this optimistic (or frightening) worldview. Introduction:
 The catch is usually omitted, or barely touched upon in these articles. These systems are dependent on information -and often lots of information (e.g., Big Data). Nevertheless, the systems outcomes will, still, never be better than their inputs. If their inputs are flooded with noise and unstructured and unspecified variables, it will be increasingly difficult for the systems to disentangle the true underlying patterns. In clinical medicine, structured and standardized data are rare. Having an entire electronic medical record (EMR) in this structured and standardized way is even rarer. Thus, developing diagnostic or treatment algorithms based on these records might seem futile, especially for those colleagues who believe that natural language processing (NLP) will solve this problem. Here, it should be remembered that EMR is a cornucopia of noisy text and language specific challenges for most countries in the world. Nevertheless, we should of course acknowledge those diagnostic tools that have already been developed, based largely on ""visual"" pattern recognition in, for instance, pathology . Precision medicine, algorithms and complex dynamic and adaptive systems:
 Based on these fundamental limitations, the near future of systems medicine or precision medicine is very bleak and limited. For sure, a few researchers and authors stand out as more reflective than others. A recent article by Manrai, Patel and Ioannidis  portrayed the future of precision medicine as even gloomier. These authors highlight the problem with one of the seemingly most standardized and structured data variables, references in laboratory tests. In addition, Mentis and co-workers  point out the possible threat of precision medicine to global health. They emphasize the dangers of ""placing too much emphasis on algorithms and not taking the patient's complex background and needs, such as culture, values, preferences, and beliefs, into consideration"" . In theory, at least, having algorithms analyzing structured and standardized complete EMRs from both small local hospitals, large university hospitals, and including the findings from general practice, rehabilitation institutions and nursing homes (among others), would address the effectiveness of much of our healthcare services from individual conditions to public health issues."

The Netherlands employs artificial intelligence to analyze its health system, finding therapeutic errors and inconsistencies in order to reduce avoidable hospitalization . Aside from existing innovations, several advancements are in different stages of exploration that will assist doctors in becoming general practitioners. IBM's Watson Healthcare is a good illustration of this, as it will be able to detect heart problems and tumor indications quickly. A system for Intelligence healthcare is being developed at Stanford University (PAC). Through the use of many detectors, PAC has developed a sophisticated senior well-being assistance system and sophisticated ICUs that will detect any behaviour change in older adults residing independently and ICU victims. Smart Handwashing Assistance and Health insurance Conversation Interfaces are two other initiatives that PAC is working on. Healthcare diagnostics:
 Depth detectors and computational vision technologies are being used to provide ideal hand washing for physicians and nurses' personnel, minimizing healthcare associated infections. Medical conversation initiatives examine how Siri, Google Now, S voice, and Cortana responds to queries from portable device users about mental wellbeing, antisocial behaviour, and physical wellbeing, enabling individuals to access treatment sooner. Molly is a computerized nurse who will give follow-up treatment to released individuals, enabling physicians to concentrate on more urgent problems. In the future, AI will play a significant role in medicine. As a result, it is critical to educate the next generation of medical students about the principles and applications of AI, as well as how to operate effectively in a workplace alongside robots for increased efficiency, while also developing soft skills such as empathy."

Understanding perceptions of these tools is essential to successful development and adoption. This exploratory study gauged participants’ level of openness, concern, and perceived benefit associated with AI-driven healthcare technologies. We also explored socio-demographic, health-related, and psychosocial correlates of these perceptions. We developed a measure depicting six AI-driven technologies that either diagnose, predict, or suggest treatment. We administered the measure via an online survey to adults (N = 936) in the United States using MTurk, a crowdsourcing platform. Participants indicated their level of openness to using the AI technology in the healthcare scenario. Items reflecting potential concerns and benefits associated with each technology accompanied the scenarios. Participants rated the extent that the statements of concerns and benefits influenced their perception of favorability toward the technology. Participants completed measures of socio-demographics, health variables, and psychosocial variables such as trust in the healthcare system and trust in technology. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the concern and benefit items identified two factors representing overall level of concern and perceived benefit. Descriptive analyses examined levels of openness, concern, and perceived benefit. Correlational analyses explored associations of socio-demographic, health, and psychosocial variables with openness, concern, and benefit scores while multivariable regression models examined these relationships concurrently. Participants were moderately open to AI-driven healthcare technologies (M = 3.1/5.0 ± 0.9), but there was variation depending on the type of application, and the statements of concerns and benefits swayed views. Trust in the healthcare system and trust in technology were the strongest, most consistent correlates of openness, concern, and perceived benefit. Most other socio-demographic, health-related, and psychosocial variables were less strongly, or not, associated, but multivariable models indicated some personality characteristics (e.g., conscientiousness and agreeableness) and socio-demographics (e.g., full-time employment, age, sex, and race) were modestly related to perceptions. Participants’ openness appears tenuous, suggesting early promotion strategies and experiences with novel AI technologies may strongly influence views, especially if implementation of AI technologies increases or undermines trust.

However, a survey of patient satisfaction with a specific application of AI for diabetic retinopathy screening in Australia found that 96% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with automated screenings, with convenience being particularly important to them . Introduction:
 In semi-structured interviews with dermatology patients in the United States (U.S.), the most common perceived advantages of AI were increased diagnostic speed, healthcare access, and diagnostic accuracy . However, patients also viewed the possibility of less accurate diagnosis to be the greatest potential disadvantage, and 94% of participants preferred human-AI partnership to AI alone. Another qualitative study of patients in the Netherlands regarding AI in radiology concluded that patients' knowledge is limited and education may be required to foster acceptance of AI and obtain patient input on implementation . A preliminary framework of patients' perspectives produced by the study indicated patients were concerned with efficiency, accountability, reliability, and the boundaries of technologies relative to human providers. Introduction:
 These prior studies did not assess openness or perceived concerns and benefits regarding AI technologies in healthcare among individuals in the U.S., or examine potential correlates that might help understand perceptions. The context and characteristics of the healthcare tasks enabled by AI may influence perceptions . Individuals may have different views of AI that enables diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis, and these views may especially depend on the seriousness, consequences, and complexity of the decision-making required . For example, individuals may respond differently to applications that diagnose or treat cancer versus a broken bone. Individuals may also hold different views related to AI-enabled technologies they might utilize at home-e.g., personalized health Apps and wearableswhereas they might prefer to engage with humans in the clinic or hospital. Further, whether the tools aim to promote wellness or provide treatment-e.g., reduce risk of heart disease versus treat heart disease-may influence perceptions. Introduction:
 In addition to perceptions potentially depending, at least in part, on task context and characteristics, individuals may perceive certain risks or benefits associated with AI-enabled technologies in healthcare. For example, the potential for AI to improve the efficiency and accuracy of decisions may be appealing, but the potential loss of professional discretion and individualized interactions may be concerning . Applications of AI in society generally have raised concerns about their potential to undermine fairness and further exacerbate inequities . A recent report from the National Academy of Medicine indicates that equity and inclusion must be prioritized when designing and scaling AI, as consumerfacing technologies in other domains have exacerbated longstanding inequities . Thus, individuals might perceive concerns related to social justice with the advent of AI-enabled tools in healthcare."

For instance, Arterys Cardio DL, the cloud analytics software recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), helps interpret cardiac MRI, reduces the workload of radiologists, and thus significantly decreases the need for specialists . SHORT-TERM STRATEGIES FOR INNOVATION: THE CURRENT BIG IDEAS:
 How will these technologies be implemented in India? Consider a use-case scenario of the ""CheXNeXt"" algorithm . This CNN-based technology utilizes chest x-rays, the most common imaging tool across the world. Built by researchers at Stanford University, it has been proven to diagnose pneumonia in suspected cases better than radiologists of the same institution, historically long-considered one of the top-ten best radiology training centers in the US . India, on the other hand, with its immense burden of infectious diseases, sorely lacks radiologists, especially at primary and secondary healthcare centers. However, x-ray diagnostic facilities are often available at community health centers. Therefore, images taken here may be uploaded online for analysis by the algorithm resulting in guidance for the rural physician. This will allow rapid confirmation of the diagnosis in non-complex cases, the majority, by a basic medical doctor leading to an early start of empiric treatment and better patient outcomes. Such innovations, by radically reducing the number of specialists required, hold immense hope for healthcare delivery in the most remote villages. Technology here complements clinical competency, with the algorithm diagnosing the majority of cases and flagging the challenging ones for review and resolution by the expert. Thus, implementing CheXNeXt in a nation where over two-thirds live in villages can have a significant impact . Unfortunately, support for this technology was not available in the current pandemic in the majority of India, where doctors in rural areas could have benefitted by getting X-rays of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia cases evaluated by a radiologist or a counterpart. SHORT-TERM STRATEGIES FOR INNOVATION: THE CURRENT BIG IDEAS:
 Furthermore, as part of healthcare innovation, AI can not only diagnose disease under supervision as above; it has been proven to work without the need for a supervising doctor, in selected cases. This gains special relevance in a nation having one of the poorest physician (allopathic) to patient ratios worldwide. Consider IBM's Watson for Oncology, whose independent therapeutic decision-making for breast cancer cases had a 93% concordance with a multi-disciplinary tumor-board . Similarly, ""IDx Dr, "" the first FDA-approved AI-based diagnostic system for screening of diabetic retinopathy, also does not require an ophthalmologist for its operation . Thus, it is of value to secondary healthcare centers in inaccessible areas, in India, permitting them to screen a large number of diabetics . This is crucial for a country having over 70 million diabetics , and a current epidemic of retinopathy . Another work, published in 2020, promises similar significance by detecting fundal papilledema with over 96% sensitivity ."

Papers have also referred to the use of virtual health assistants and AI chatbots to facilitate engagement for patients with providing tailored information . Research Gap:
 Despite these contributions being important, they are fundamentally technologies-centric, specifically looking at system capabilities, algorithm actions, and operational capacities. Research Gap:
 Nonetheless, there is a glaring omission in the literature on the patient-side experience, especially in terms of the quality of communication between patients and healthcare providers and the patients' understanding of health-related information once provided an AI-enabled service. Research Gap:
 The literature contains very few studies exploring AI effects on health literacy, that is, how well patients can understand, remember and apply medical advice given to them in an AI related service. Research Gap:
 While there has been some work to discuss patient engagement and access to AI-enabled health (Unanah & Aidoo, 2025), empirical studies researching AIenabled educational tools and how they positively impact healthcare and health outcomes -particularly in relation to non-clinical and everyday health management -are still developing."

There are both potential advantages and disadvantages with such technology in advancing the interests of patients, with resultant ontological and epistemic concerns for physicians and patients relating to the instatiation of AI as a dependent, semi- or fully-autonomous agent in the encounter. The concept of libertarian paternalism potentially exercised by AI (and those who control it) has created challenges to conventional assessments of patient and physician autonomy. The unclear legal relationship between AI and its users cannot be settled presently, an progress in AI and its implementation in patient care will necessitate an iterative discourse to preserve humanitarian concerns in future models of care. This paper proposes that physicians should neither uncritically accept nor unreasonably resist developments in AI but must actively engage and contribute to the discourse, since AI will affect their roles and the nature of their work. One's moral imaginative capacity must be engaged in the questions of beneficence, autonomy, and justice of AI and whether its integration in healthcare has the potential to augment or interfere with the ends of medical practice.","non-academic areas of human life can be reduced to (or translated into) science"" and accompanying scientific expansionist claims that ""all beliefs that can be known (or even rationally maintained) must and can be included within the boundaries of science"" . Discussion:
 The related secular belief system of datafication underpins ""precision medicine"" (Van Dijck 2014), whereby technology permits ""new phenomena and areas of ordinary life [to become] subject to measurement, attention, and medical interpretation"" . Datafication is reflected in prevalent genetic determinism (Dar-Nimrod and Heine 2011), supersedes post-modern relativism, and places an overreliance on screening, biomarkers, and the predictive role of -omics for patient care . Regardless of the data that is incorporated in AIM, ""these new algorithmic decision-making tools come with no guarantees of fairness, equitability, or even veracity"" . This concern may compound when future persons with access to ""democratized"" information  and personal versions of AI may drive a values-poor and data-centric form of shared decision-making as a new norm . A personally-controlled electronic medical record (EMR) incorporating data from primary care, hospital interactions, consultative doctor-patient interactions, and network-based ""collaborations to integrate genetic and genomic knowledge into clinical care"" may embolden patients to accept, override, or even ignore information or physician recommendations based on algorithmic decision aids  in the name of person-centric care. Discussion:
 The potential denigration of human capacities and skills ) is exemplified by the example of robotic neurosurgery for compressive radiculopathy illustrates the confusion this may generate for patients . Consent is predicated on the patient's understanding that the surgeon rather than the AIM system determines the need for surgery, a common misunderstanding provoking patient anxiety, as is the perceived extent and invasiveness of robotic surgery . If the patient's understanding of the role of AI in their care is unclear, it exposes all parties to potential liabilities which may be difficult to disentangle, with potential corporeal and legal adverse effects. The clinical encounter extends beyond the patient (and their various influences) and the physician, instantiating ""AIM"" as a team member in a therapeutic triad . Discussion:
 The traditional doctor-patient dyad has been affected by population diversity, globalized access to information, and increasing technologization of much of the urbanized populace , with the emergence of the e-patient, ""equipped, enabled, empowered and engaged in their health and health care decisions"" , who may either doubt or refute the notion of physician omniscience and actively engage in their own care . Reflecting income and education, access to and facility with technology has always been a determinant of health , and it is suggested that access to technology may potentially mitigate some social health disparities , at least amongst those with sufficient access. However, the potential for the amplification of health disparities with unequal access to (or dependence on) technology has largely been overlooked."

Recent developments in diagnostic technologies facilitated studies on retinal conditions and ocular disease in metabolism and endocrinology. Globally, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is regarded as a major cause of vision loss. Deep learning systems are effective and accurate in the detection of DR from digital fundus photographs or optical coherence tomography. Thus, using AI techniques, systems with high accuracy and efficiency can be developed for diagnosing and screening DR at an early stage and without the resources that are only accessible in special clinics. Deep learning enables early diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity, which makes decisions based on minimally handcrafted features paving the way for personalized DR progression real-time monitoring and in-time ophthalmic or endocrine therapies. This review will discuss cutting-edge AI algorithms, the automated detecting systems of DR stage grading and feature segmentation, the prediction of DR outcomes and therapeutics, and the ophthalmic indications of other systemic diseases revealed by AI.","to ophthalmic clinic still faces some problems in reality. Although there are many representative international datasets of DR available to build the diagnosis model, they were designed with insufficient consideration for clinical adaptability. The data quality was uneven and the labeling standards varied. Conclusion:
 Therefore, a standardized dataset with a large sample size needs to be constructed with authoritative and recognized high-quality annotations, which is prerequisite to improve the performance of AI systems finally. In addition, the regulatory mechanism and evaluation criteria have not yet formed a complete and unified system. It is also necessary to establish and improve an AI product evaluation system that conforms to medical evaluation standards before the large-scale clinical use of AI, in order to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Conclusion:
 Since DR has seen the first FDA clearance named IDx-DR for an autonomous AI diagnostic system without an image interpretation provided by a specialist, more and more commercial products are developed and believed to come into the market in the near future. In China, training and validation data for AI algorithms are vast due to a rather centralized healthcare system and the largest population of DR (93). Hundreds of new start-up companies working on AI applications to healthcare in China have emerged to improve business, and several DR AI-based screening tools have acquired the certificate of medical device Class III approved by NMPA as pioneers, e.g., Silicon Intelligence, Airdoc, Vistel, and especially Intelligent Healthcare of Baidu that developed the first granted algorithm working robustly with various fundus camera models and achieving high accuracies for detecting multiple ophthalmic diseases . Undoubtedly, the real-world deployment of these new systems in multiple settings will be full of challenges not only in AI diagnostic technologies but also in the marketing pattern and policy-making. The combination of telemedicine aided by 5G technology and automated retinal image analysis will enhance the convenience of DR care by  Scheme of the AI-based applications integrating DR screening with multimodal features. Fundus image inputs, including digital fundus photography and OCT, integrated with multimodal features, are indicative for diverse systemic diseases such as diabetes, nephropathy, cognitive disorder, and cerebro-or cardiovascular disease, facilitating the four perspectives of medical practice concerned. Conclusion:
 providing automated real-time assessment in a more personalized way, supporting commercial interests to promote the whole industry. Additionally, multicenter, head-to-head, real-world validation, multimodality, and improved algorithm studies are imperative and encouraged to conduct, which might magnify the significance of DR screening beyond preventing sight-threatening diseases to the new strategies of systemic diagnosis in metabolism and endocrinology."

Discussion: Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computer algorithms to learn from data without being explicitly programmed to perform a task . As depicted in Figure , deep learning has the most significant impact on precision medicine. Discussion:
 Deep learning represents the most advanced form of ML presently available and has emerged since 2010 as an AI technique facilitating the analysis of medical images and genomic studies . Discussion:
 Recently, deep learning successfully identified two distinct subtypes of glioma from genomic data, providing insights into their individual molecular mechanisms . Furthermore, deep learning has the potential to reduce drug discovery costs by efficiently screening for potential candidates, thereby reducing time compared to traditional methods . Discussion:
 The system was not explicitly directed to perform this task; it identified patterns from the data and ""taught itself"" what to look for and report. Discussion:
 As quoted in the synopsis of the Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics section of the 2017 IMIA Yearbook , precision public/global health and digital epidemiology are terms that are still in use in 2018 . Discussion:
 The former term pertains to delivering the appropriate intervention to the right population at the right time . The latter term involves utilizing digital data, particularly data not intentionally collected, to address epidemiological inquiries . Discussion:
 In epidemiology, the huge potential of Big Data was illustrated by a pioneering study reported by Deiner ,who illustrated that the early detection of epidemics can be achieved by tracking online queries on disease symptoms using social media platforms such as Google Search and Twitter. Discussion:
 Pattern recognition and data analytics served as tools for detecting, recognizing, and classifying patterns of disease incidence related to conjunctivitis. Conversely, wearable technologies will enable the monitoring and collection of individual medical information and the refinement of the care process. Discussion:
 The fusion of AI with virtual reality and augmented reality , will enable the creation of both virtual medical services that citizens can access easily and directly, as well as increasingly effective and safe applications for robotic surgery. Discussion:
 It is noteworthy that the keyword ""ethics"" is depicted in Figure , indicating a growing focus on AI ethics in medicine. Legal regulations and guidelines for medical AI are often formulated without engaging in dialogue among ethicists, developers, clinicians, and community members. Discussion:
 This lack of collaboration may result in regulations that do not align with the experiences of community members as users of medical AI. Discussion:
 Ethical concerns identified by policymakers and scholars may differ from those recognized by actual patients, providers, and developers, leading to a disconnect where ethical decision-making tools may not be perceived as relevant to AI users. Discussion:
 Regulatory practices often stem from higher-level ethical theories and principles rather than from an examination of actual knowledge and practices of medical AI ethics using real-world examples . Discussion:
 Identifying empirical research on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical AI ethics can lead to the development of mechanisms that may assist educators, researchers, and ethicists in clarifying and addressing perceived ethical challenges . Discussion:
 As AI interactions involve patients, families, and healthcare providers, it is crucial to comprehend individuals' awareness of the ethical issues that may impact their use of AI in healthcare delivery and to determine how these findings can inform the development and research of medical AI."

AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective? Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.","behaviours in pursuit of, and as a result of, their new independence . A comparable tension existed in the literature between the safety of care recipients, which some believe care robots protect, and the infringement on the recipient's physical, and information privacy . Diagnostics:
 Diagnostics was an area that also garnered significant attention with regard to ethics. Of note was the 'black box' nature of machine learning processes , frequently mentioned with a HCP's inability to scrutinize the output . Acknowledging that the more advanced the AI system, the more difficult it is to discern its functioning , there was also a concern that due to the difficulty in understanding how and why a machine learning program produces an output, there is a risk of encountering biased outputs . us, despite the challenge of navigating these opaque AI systems, there was a call for said systems to be explainable in order to ensure responsible AI . Also a pervasive theme was the replacement and augmentation of the health workforce, particularly physicians, as a result of AI's role in diagnostics . While few feared the full replacement of physicians in diagnostics , some expected its presence to actually enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their work . ere were expressed concerns, however, about how the roles and interactions of physicians may change with its introduction, such as the ethical dilemma encountered if a machine learning algorithm is inconsistent with the HCP's recommendation, if it contradicts a patient's account of their own condition, or if it fails to consider patients' non-verbal communication and social context . Precision medicine:
 Issues of bias persisted in discussions of precision medicine, with the recognition that biased data sets, such as those that exclude certain patient populations, can produce inaccurate predictions that in turn can have unfair consequences for patients . While precision medicine was a less prominent theme than the aforementioned AI applications, questions of the accuracy of predictive health information from the intersection of AI and genomics arose, as did an uncertainty of where and by whom that data may then be used . In the case of AI-assisted gene editing, deep learning holds potential for directing experts where in the human genome to use gene editing technologies such as CRISPR, to reduce an individual's risk of contracting a genetic disease or disorder . However, deep learning models cannot discern the moral difference between gene editing for health optimization, and gene editing for human enhancement more generally, which may blur ethical lines . A further tension existed in how the technology is deployed to support human choices; for example if a person not only seeks gene editing to reduce their risk of inheriting a particular genetic disease, but to also increase their muscle mass, obtain a particular personality trait, or enhance their musical ability . Also illuminated was the implications of AI-enabled precision medicine in the global north versus the global south . First is the possibility that this technology, given its high associated costs and greater accessibility in the developed world, might leave LMICs behind . Second was the awareness that the introduction of genetic testing may undermine low cost, scalable and effective public health measures, which should remain central to global health ."

Massive improvements in image processing and computer hardware have allowed the emergence of multiple imaging techniques of the eye that can transform patient care. The purpose of this review is to describe the most recent advances in eye imaging and explain how new technologies and imaging methods can be utilized in a clinical setting. The introduction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) was a revolution in eye imaging and has since become the standard of care for a plethora of conditions. Its most recent iterations, OCT angiography, and visible light OCT, as well as imaging modalities, such as fluorescent lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, would allow a more thorough evaluation of patients and provide additional information on disease processes. Toward that goal, the application of adaptive optics (AO) and full-field scanning to a variety of eye imaging techniques has further allowed the histologic study of single cells in the retina and anterior segment.

 The most exciting prospect of eye imaging is the incorporation of AI. AI is becoming more accessible and broadly studied, and ophthalmology provides the perfect foundation for its rapid evolution. As such, it is fairly safe to assume that ophthalmology will be among the first medical specialties to transition from a traditional, physician-only care approach to a collaboration between human and software decision-making. The ability to provide valuable data from simple images can help millions of people get eye care in the first place but also improve and optimize the way patients are managed and treated. There are still, though, issues to be considered before safely applying AI in the routine care; these range from mostly technical, namely, the issue of performing AI tasks in most imaging devices, to medical in order to ensure its efficacy and reliability, as well as ethical. Despite these hurdles, AI will be a huge step toward ultimately decreasing blindness and providing equal health care across the entire population. CONCLUSION:
 In conclusion, the evolution of ocular imaging is truly fascinating. The next years will be critical in its evolution and will definitely contribute to the ultimate goals of minimizing blindness and ensuring optimal care for patients."

However, most existing data, position statements and guidelines are limited by the lack of availability of large clinical trials to support these recommendations. Furthermore, there are significant challenges regarding proper access to cardio-oncology care and treatment, particularly in marginalized and minority populations. The emergence and evolution of personalized medicine, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning in medicine and in cardio-oncology provides an opportunity for a more targeted, personalized approach to cardiovascular complications of cancer treatment. The proper implementation of these new modalities may facilitate a more equitable approach to adequate and universal access to cardio-oncology care, improve health related outcomes, and enable health care systems to eliminate the digital divide.

 In order to go from traditional approaches to precision medicine, new non-routine clinical and non-clinical data will be needed (Figure ): the implementation of precision medicine, AI, and machine learning will be critical for meaningful deep phenotyping of cardio-oncology patients (Table ). This approach will hopefully lead toward improved CV outcomes. If properly implemented, precision cardio-oncology may become the proper tool to eliminate the digital divide with algorithms based on biological, genetic, and molecular parameters that can equally benefit diverse populations. Discussion:
 Proper utilization of high-quality datasets, existing datasets from nationalized health care systems, and established and emerging collaborations through networks and professional societies looking at real-world data, EHR data and registries, will expand the understanding of risk stratification and the assessment of cardiovascular care of cancer patients in diverse populations, well-beyond the narrow scope of selected patient populations that are eligible to participate in clinical trials. Discussion:
 To bridge the digital divide, AI and machine learning systems data should undergo constant re-training and continuous monitoring to eliminate healthcare bias and undue influence from social determinants of health. Proper utilization and programming of these novel tools will result in a more personalized approach and subsequently impact quality of life for all patients regardless of background, demographics, ethnicity, or socio-economic background. Discussion:
 Overarching measures to mitigate inequities in cardiooncology, including those attributable to innovative health systems would require increasing access to digital health platforms, unbiased precision care, deconstructing healthcare bias, and instilling confidence. Mandating appropriate level of inclusion of marginalized populations in clinical research and a multidisciplinary management approach is also necessary. These measures will facilitate the implementation of precision care for innovative health systems utilizing accurate and representative data that foster advantageous outcomes for all. Bridging the digital divide in this way will require a teambased strategy with contributions from all stakeholders: patients and their families, healthcare providers, third-party payers, community leaders, government agencies, and innovative technology companies and corporations. Such a multifaceted approach would facilitate developing consumer-focused digital health systems that are interactive, intuitive, current, and culturally and socially competent."

Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our disease knowledge and altered diagnosis and treatment approaches resulting in a more precise, predictive, preventative and personalized health care that is customized for the individual patient. Consequently, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to mine such a vast data set. Additionally, personalized medicine promises to revolutionize healthcare, with its key goal of providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time and dose, and thus the potential of improving quality of life and helping to bring down healthcare costs. This policy briefing will look in detail at the issues surrounding continued development, sustained investment, risk factors, testing and approval of innovations for better strategy and faster process. The paper will serve as a policy bridge that is required to enhance a conscious decision among the powers-that-be in Qatar in order to find a way to harmonize multiple strands of activity and responsibility in the health arena. The end goal will be for Qatar to enhance public awareness and engagement and to integrate effectively the incredible advances in research into healthcare systems, for the benefit of all patients. The PM policy briefing provides concrete recommendations on moving forward with PM initiatives in Qatar and internationally. Equally important, integration of PM within a primary care setting, building a coalition of community champions through awareness and advocacy, finally, communicating PM value, patient engagement/empowerment and education/continued professional development programs of the healthcare workforce. Key recommendations for implementation of precision medicine inside and outside Qatar:





















 PM is no longer futuristic. It is here. Implementing PM in routine clinical care does require some investment and infrastructure development. Invariably, cost and lack of expertise are cited as barriers to PM implementation. Equally consequential, are the curriculum and professional development of medical care experts. Policymakers need to lead and coordinate effort among stakeholders and consider cultural and faith perspectives to ensure success. It is essential that policymakers integrate PM approaches into national strategies to improve health and health care for all, and to drive towards the future of medicine precision health.","patient support organizations with PM information and educational materials, and actively manage multiple communication and dissemination channels. Infrastructure and information management: ➢ Identify physician, pharmacists and community leaders to engage patients and participate in regional events that raise awareness and promote precision medicine. Infrastructure and information management:
 ➢ Update medical and pharmacy schools' curricula to integrate PM concepts and develop PM Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs. Patient engagement and empowerment:
 ➢ Include patient representatives in the development of proactive policies and practices related to patient protections and the use of individual molecular information. Patient engagement and empowerment:
 ➢ Implement state-of-the-art cyber-security measures related to individual molecular information. Patient engagement and empowerment:
 ➢ Develop programs to explain diagnostic test results to patients; provide them with recommendations and easy access to related information and counseling services. Patient engagement and empowerment:
 ➢ Incorporate patient-reported outcomes through multiple channels to capture and better understand patient experiences. Patient engagement and empowerment:
 ➢ Design clinical trials with diverse research participants that include persons of various ethnicities, races, ages and genders to better inform the value of a specific treatment option for any given patient. Conclusion:
 Preparing the public, healthcare professionals and policy decision-makers to the future of medicine is critical. Incrementally, the healthcare system is departing from traditional medicine. The promise of PM is so great, for a moment it seems so intimidating. Distinctively, it builds on data, analytics and AI. It also requires trust amongst stakeholders and patients to harness the benefits of precision medicine. Conclusion:
 The value and success of PM is evident in cancer treatment and genomics, and PM will continue to do so. However, organizations have shown limited establishment of PM programs in the past, with implementation cost and lack of expertise as the most commonly cited barriers. Additional barriers include limited resources, test turnaround time, lack of knowledge amongst healthcare professionals and communication challenges. In summary, despite the potential of precision medicine to transform healthcare, the adoption of PM in practice has been slow, in large part due to the lack of evidence of clinical utility provided by tests. Other interrelated factors include evidence of test cost-effectiveness, limited insurance coverage, and inadequate regulatory framework. Conclusion:
 It is essential that policymakers integrate PM approaches into national strategies to improve healthcare. These approaches will ultimately merge with efforts to address rising rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), expand health data infrastructure and connectivity, develop genomic data policy, increase diagnostic capacity, and create biobanks that hold both physical and digital resources. Conclusion:
 Technology and innovations in medicine aim to help all patients globally, providing evidence for particular conditions that need to be personally considered, involving the patient's decision while treating, predicting and preventing disease. The purpose should be to have precision medicine available everywhere at any time for everyone."

Significant improvements in diagnosis, treatments, and mitigation of AD are likely to result from the development and application of a comprehensive approach to precision medicine (PM), as is the case with several other diseases. This strategy will probably be based on the achievements made in more sophisticated research areas, including cancer. PM will require the direct integration of neurology, neuroscience, and psychiatry into a paradigm of the healthcare field that turns away from the isolated method. PM is biomarker-guided treatment at a systems level that incorporates findings of the thorough pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders as well as methodological developments. Comprehensive examination and categorization of interrelated and convergent disease processes, an explanation of the genomic and epigenetic drivers, a description of the spatial and temporal paths of natural history, biological markers, and risk markers, as well as aspects about the regulation, and the ethical, governmental, and sociocultural repercussions of findings at a subclinical level all require clarification and realistic execution.

Implementation of Artificial Intelligence as a Road to Precision Medicine:
 In a recent study, in addition to the huge data gleaned from deep phenotyping, participants also had access to a behavior coach. The Pioneer 100 Wellness Project (P100) represented a first attempt to collect and examine substantial omics data-sets in order to link molecular circuits in 108 healthy individuals. Over more than a nine-month timeframe, this study did whole genome sequencing, microbiome, proteome, and metabolome analyses. It also recorded clinical data, daily physical activity, and sleep patterns. Each participant had a personal, comprehensive, dynamic data cloud generated by the researchers, who also conducted an integrated study of six various kinds of data. Furthermore, the participants' wellbeing in terms of diet, inflammation, diabetes, and CVDs was dramatically improved by these data-driven insights combined with behaviour coaching . For 109 people who were at a higher risk for diabetes, a similar study used wearable monitoring and extensive longitudinal omics profiling. They used multi-omics, including measurements of the gut microbiota and the genome, transcriptome, immunome, metabolome, and proteome. They identified 67 clinically actionable outcomes over such a lengthy period, such as the risk of cardiovascular disease . Limitation, Regulation, and Ethical and Societal Consideration of Precision Medicine:
 While innovations are being used to create a new approach to decision-making, PM has not been assured to be valuable or effective due to a lack of information, strong clinical evidence, and widely accepted data models for validating the practical work . Limitation, Regulation, and Ethical and Societal Consideration of Precision Medicine:
 Considering the availability of different data structures and associated challenges in implementing the current data interchange standards, there have been numerous restrictions and difficulties in medication, laboratory, diagnostic, imaging, pathophysiology, clinical findings and outcomes, and protocols, such as incorporating genetic results in a searchable manner into electronic medical records (EMR). Additionally, testing that is carried out in outside labs frequently cannot be incorporated into other networks. Some of the major issues with data exchange are variations in lab coding systems and identifications or missing genetic information in electronic health record (EHR) datasets . Additionally, selecting the ideal time for clinical data sharing develops into a competitive procedure that requires attention ."

Conclusion:
 AI-based CAD software could eventually help radiologists to better manage workload, enhance individual performance and reduce human error. Although this software device is currently limited to a single common disease, its capability is expected to grow over time to identify multiple challenging diagnoses.  In the foreseeable future, other AIbased devices and systems will also be assimilated into clinical practice with a view to improve quality and efficiency, similar to current applications on digital imaging methods.  These changes could shift the current practice of placing patients within risk groups and move it towards more individualised predictions; however, the radiology community must first assume a more active role in propelling medicine into the digital age. This could certainly be done by combining AI and radiologists into a form of hybrid intelligence or a ""radiologist-in-the-loop"".  At a professional level, clinicians will need to work closely with the AI research and development community, regulators and policymakers to realise the vision of a dynamic, adaptive, and active learning healthcare system. Conclusion:
 More immediate concerns include encouraging the development of representative training datasets, adoption of a common interoperable software framework for research and clinical purposes, and introduction of a standardised approach for benchmarking and implementation of AI applications.  As we have discussed, the success of AI applications will depend on researchers gaining access to large volume of quality health data. This will certainly be the case for upscaling IDx-DR, and the road ahead for similar software will be challenging. A higher regulatory threshold under the FDA's De Novo premarket review pathway now applies, as a diabetic retinopathy AI diagnostic device is already available in the market. Fundamental to all of these initiatives is the need to develop and sustain a governance approach that promotes collaboration among all stakeholders to ensure the responsible development and implementation of AI in biomedicine. Such an approach will require a much closer integration of ethics, laws, and good practices,  and is viable only if it engenders trust and is trustworthy."

The field of AI has recently experienced significant advancements in image recognition due to a technique called deep learning, and is increasingly being investigated in ophthalmic image segmentation, analysis, and clinical decision making [1–5].","retinopathy. When used in a teleophthalmology platform, nonmydriatic ultra widefield imaging can reduce the rates of ungradable images, decrease image evaluation time, and increase the rate of identification of DR compared to traditional fundus photography . Discussion/conclusion:
 The infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) into ophthalmology is occurring, and point of care AI may improve image quality, reduce the number of ungradable images, and more effectively triage care in the setting of limited availability of subspecialists . Eventually, clinically validated AI algorithms may augment virtual clinics that triage care to specialized physicians as necessary (Fig. ). As ophthalmologists, we must perform due diligence to clinically validate such increasingly diverse telemedicine tools. There are numerous considerations involving legal, reimbursement, security, and ethical issues which must be addressed. Whether an algorithm is AI-assisted with diagnostic decision-making in the hands of physicians, or AIdriven without human intervention, there are significant legal ramifications. For example, a primary care physician can potentially rely on AI-driven algorithms to dictate escalation of care. However, during a potential delay in care or false negative diagnosis, the liability becomes unclear. AI based on supervised learning must be trained on labeled images, and there exists a risk of a false negative diagnosis if the algorithm is presented a disease process it was not trained with. Reimbursement with emergent technologies can be equally ambiguous. IDX, LLC (Coralville, IA) recently received FDA approval for its diabetic retinopathy screening algorithm that is physician independent (https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/new sroom/pressannouncements/ucm604357.htm), using the FDA designation of breakthrough technology. Time savings and removal of professional fees for interpretation of exams may become a major consideration for payer reimbursement structure. Reimbursement will be an evolving process, with implications for further development of the technology. Additionally, while there is potential for cost savings, we must consider the often costly investment in IT and security infrastructure to support this new technology. Discussion/conclusion:
 With any emergent technology that has the potential of significantly altering healthcare delivery, we must consider issues of ethics and access.

In diabetes, where there is substantial heterogeneity in risk, progression and treatment response, this approach holds particular promise. However, the majority of precision medicine research has been conducted in populations of White European ancestry, limiting its relevance and equity across ethnically diverse groups. This review examines the role of ethnicity in precision diabetes medicine, highlighting its potential value and limitations. It summarises evidence for ethnic variation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including differences in susceptibility, phenotypes and complications, and demonstrates how under-representation in research has led to diagnostic and therapeutic blind spots. Three conceptual models for incorporating ethnicity into precision approaches are described: ancestry-anchored discovery, ethnicity-adapted translation and trait-based individualisation. Each model presents distinct opportunities for and challenges to equitable implementation. The review also outlines key barriers, such as limited diversity in discovery science, inconsistent data infrastructure, and resource constraints, and proposes practical strategies to overcome them. It concludes by identifying critical research gaps and emphasises the need for inclusive and context-sensitive models of precision medicine that account for both inter- and intra-ethnic diversity. Realising this vision will be essential to delivering effective and equitable diabetes care globally. ","foster trust, improve uptake and ensure relevance. Additionally, models should consider life-course and environmental exposures (e.g. urbanisation, nutrition, infection, stress), which often vary by ethnicity and interact with genetic susceptibility to influence diabetes risk and progression . Reconciling conceptual models for equitable precision medicine:
 A key priority for the field will be to establish consensus frameworks for how ethnicity is defined, measured and operationalised in precision medicine research, and to embed ancestral and ethnic diversity at every stage, from discovery science to implementation and evaluation. Barriers, solutions and research gaps:
 Despite growing momentum in precision diabetes medicine, several systemic, structural and scientific barriers continue to hinder the equitable application of these approaches in ethnically diverse and low-resource settings (Table ). While precision medicine holds promise for advancing equity, many disparities in diabetes care stem from entrenched structural and social determinants. Barriers, solutions and research gaps:
 Arguably, a more inclusive application of evidence-based medicine, addressing barriers such as health literacy, access to care and underdiagnosis, could close equity gaps even without precision tools. Practical measures such as culturally adapted care, broader diagnostic reach for under-represented groups and locally tailored interventions remain essential. Barriers, solutions and research gaps:
 Precision strategies should build on these foundations rather than replace them. An important open question is whether targeted improvements within existing care models might, in some settings, provide more immediate or scalable equity gains than precision approaches. Barriers, solutions and research gaps:
 These need not be mutually exclusive; pursuing both in parallel may provide the greatest benefit. Conclusions:
 Precision medicine offers a valuable opportunity to tailor diabetes care to individual and population-level differences, but its potential will only be realised if it is equitable. Ethnic variation in diabetes risk, phenotypes and treatment response is well established, yet remains under-represented in the evidence base informing precision approaches. Conclusions:
 Applying tools derived primarily in White European populations without adequate validation risks reduced performance and may inadvertently perpetuate disparities. Conclusions:
 Rather than discarding ethnicity as a variable, we must use it thoughtfully, acknowledging both its limitations and its potential value as a proxy for underlying biological and sociocultural factors. Conclusions:
 Progress will require greater diversity in discovery science, improved recording and standardised use of ancestry and ethnicity data, and investment in scalable models that work across healthcare settings. Conclusions:
 Moving forward, the focus must be on building precision medicine frameworks that are robust, generalisable and inclusive, ensuring that advances in diagnosis and treatment deliver meaningful benefits to communities affected by diabetes."

The trials and tribulations of the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic have set the stage for shifting healthcare from a physical to a cyber-physical space. A physician can now remotely monitor a patient, admitting them only if they meet certain thresholds, thereby reducing the total number of admissions at the hospital. Coordination, communication, and resource management have been core issues for any industry. However, it is most accurate in healthcare. Both systems and providers are exhausted under the burden of increasing data and complexity of care delivery, increasing costs, and financial burden. Simultaneously, there is a digital transformation of healthcare in the making. This transformation provides an opportunity to create systems of care that are artificial intelligence-enabled.

 There are substantial ethical challenges in AI implementation in healthcare. Accessibility and inequality have already profoundly impacted healthcare. AI can be expensive, and large portions of humanity may not have access to these tools because companies are charging premium prices for their services. Hence, it has the potential to deepen information inequality as well. Challenges and limitations:
 The bidirectional flow of information between healthcare providers and patients is crucial for continuously monitoring patients at risk for recurrent episodes of life-threatening disease. Therefore, it is critical to have a certain level of consistency among digital health tools in predicting the severity of symptoms in out-of-hospital patients. The significant challenges that hinder the implementation of these tools range from their reliability to their integration into existing health systems. Conclusion:
 Digital healthcare, like digital banking, will be the future norm. We need to use a design process that enables intelligent communication, coordination, and resource management during the whole journey of acute patients instead of introducing isolated solutions. By integrating smart solutions into the healthcare system as a whole, we can save a tremendous amount of money and enhance healthcare delivery. This type of solution will not be limited to acute settings but can be implemented in outpatient, mobile clinics, and other touchpoints in a patient's journey. We will continue to see further convergence of technologies, enabling new experiences for both patients and providers."

CDSSs are utilized in augmenting healthcare facilities in the process of making complex clinical decisions. Since the first application of CDSSs in the 80s, the framework has witnessed significant transformation. The frameworks are now administered through electronic healthcare records with complex capacities. Irrespective of these complex advancements, there are existing questions concerning the impacts of CDSSs on service providers, healthcare costs, and patients’ records. There are many published texts concerning the success stories of CDSSs, but significant setbacks have proved that CDSSs are not without any potential risks. In this research, we provide critical analysis on the application of CDSSs in clinical setting, integrating various forms, present application cases with proven effectiveness, potential harms and common pitfalls. We therefore conclude with evidence-centered recommendation for mitigating the issues of CDSSs maintainability, evaluation, implementation and designing.","unfavourable medical prejudices and attitudes, lower precision (frequently because of dataset gaps), and inefficient systems' engineering that requires human data input. Better EHR connection and standard language, such as Snomed Medical Terms, are helping to improve the latter. Diagnostics Support:
 Authors in [8] developed a DDSS for the assessment of diabetic neuropathy using fuzzy approach, which is a nice sample of a successful DDSS. They obtained 93% accuracy in detecting motors, perceptual, combined neuropathies, and usual cases using data input that included indications and medical test results when contrasted to specialists. While this is very useful, particularly in places where established diagnostic specialists are few, also there is a need for technologies that can augment professional diagnosis.
