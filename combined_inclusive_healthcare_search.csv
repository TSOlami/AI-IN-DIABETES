In medical education, the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) has transformational potential in realising these objectives through creating inclusive, innovative, and adaptive learning spaces. This scoping review considers the use of AI and STEAM-based curriculum design and assessment to further SDG-4 within medical education for the purposes of enhancing inclusivity, scalability, and ethical practice. Adopting the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, researchers systematically charted peer-reviewed literature obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. 50 studies were identified, with prominent themes being: AI-oriented personalised learning, STEAM-based interdisciplinary education, and issues such as ethical dilemmas, digital divides, and curriculum congestion. The review uncovers a significant absence of standard frameworks to implement AI and suggests the INSPIRE Model (Inclusive, Nimble, Scalable, Personalised, Interprofessional, Reflective, and Ethical) as a new framework to fill these gaps. The INSPIRE Model uses AI-powered technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems and real-time analytics, in conjunction with STEAM principles to produce adaptive, modular curricula that address the needs of various types of learners, including those in low-resource environments. It advocates for ethical use of AI, Interprofessional collaboration, and AI literacy in order to equip medical students for an AI-enhanced healthcare future. Evidence shows that integration of AI and STEAM can promote access to quality education, narrow gaps, and drive critical thinking, in line with SDG-4 goals. Yet, access impediments such as scarce infrastructure and faculty development call for specific interventions like international partnerships and scalable digital tools. The INSPIRE Model provides a blueprint for stakeholders to integrate inclusive, sustainable systems of medical education. Subsequent studies should aim to pilot-test the model and assess its long-term effect on educational equity as well as on health outcomes, while being guided by SDG-4's vision of lifelong learning for all.

What began as an emergency response has now become a permanent feature of the educational landscape, evolving from static textbooks to dynamic digital platforms that offer greater accessibility, inclusivity, and personalization of learning experiences.1 In the AI era, it is insufficient to merely digitize the curriculum; a comprehensive transformation is essential. The digital curriculum opens new avenues for interactive learning environments, simulation-based practices, and adaptive learning algorithms that respond to the individual needs of students. AI-driven tools such as virtual patient simulations, diagnostic decision-making platforms, and predictive analytics have the potential to revolutionize how medical students learn, practice, and apply their knowledge in clinical settings.2 These innovations allow for an enhanced learning experience where students can interact with realistic patient cases and make informed decisions, fostering a deeper understanding of clinical practice.
 
One of the most promising applications of AI in medical education is its role as an educational partner. AI-powered platforms can function as personalized tutors, providing real-time feedback, adjusting learning modules based on student performance, and even predicting areas where additional support may be required.3 Adaptive learning systems can analyze the learner’s pace and comprehension, offering tailored resources to bridge knowledge gaps. This personalized approach to education ensures that no student is left behind, addressing one of the longstanding challenges of traditional, one-size-fits-all curricula. Additionally, AI can enhance clinical reasoning through simulation and data-driven case scenarios. By analyzing patterns in patient data, AI algorithms can help medical students gain deeper insights into complex clinical decision-making processes. This data-driven approach can significantly improve learners’ ability to diagnose and plan treatments, thereby improving clinical outcomes. While AI and digital tools offer substantial benefits, the role of educators remains essential in this new educational paradigm. Rather than replacing teachers, AI will augment their roles, allowing them to focus on mentorship, critical thinking, and the ethical dimensions of healthcare.4 Educators will need to reimagine their roles, becoming facilitators of learning who guide students in interpreting and applying AI-generated data in clinical settings. As AI takes on administrative tasks such as grading, educators can dedicate more time to meaningful interactions with students.5 However, this shift toward AI-driven curricula also requires significant investment in faculty development. Educators must be trained in the use of AI tools and possess a thorough understanding of their applications to ensure that AI is used responsibly and effectively in shaping future healthcare professionals.
 
As AI becomes more integrated into medical education, addressing the ethical challenges associated with this technology becomes crucial. While AI-driven tools hold great promise, they must be designed and deployed with an acute awareness of biases, data privacy concerns, and the risk of over-reliance on algorithms in clinical decision-making.6 The digital curriculum must provide students with technical skills and a strong ethical foundation for AI use in healthcare. Students must be trained to critically evaluate AI outputs, understand their limitations, and ensure that human judgment remains central to patient care. Transforming medical curricula in the AI era is not without challenges. Digital divides, access to technology, and the initial cost of AI-driven platforms may pose barriers to widespread adoption. Institutions must ensure equitable access to resources for all students, regardless of their geographic or socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, regulatory bodies such as the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) must revise standards to accommodate these technological advancements. In conclusion, the transformation of medical and dental curricula into a digital, AI-enhanced model represents not only a modernization of education but also a fundamental shift in preparing future healthcare professionals. By embracing AI as an educational partner, medical institutions can create personalized, data-driven learning environments that equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an increasingly complex healthcare landscape.

- **Reasoning:** Uses AI-powered LMS to personalize learning pace and proposes adaptive curricula, but lacks focus on health equity, research integration, or combined inclusive outcomes.","To address the evolving, quantitative nature of healthcare in the twenty-first century, it is imperative to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with healthcare education. To bridge this educational gap, it is imperative to impart practical skills for the utilisation and interpretation of AI in healthcare settings, integrate technology into clinical operations, develop AI technologies, and enhance human competencies [1]. The swift rise of AI in contemporary society can be ascribed to the progress of intricate algorithms, cost-effective graphic processors, and huge annotated databases. AI has been a crucial component of healthcare education in recent years and has been implemented by numerous medical institutions globally. AI is widely prevalent in medical education in Western countries, in contrast to developing countries. The disparity could be mitigated through more infrastructural assistance from medical institutions in underdeveloped nations. It is crucial to raise awareness among medical educators and students regarding AI tools to facilitate the development and integration of AI-based technologies in medical education [2]. AI can impact the student learning process through three methods: direct instruction (transferring knowledge to the student in a teacher-like role), instructional support (assisting students as they learn), and learner empowerment (facilitating collaboration among multiple students to solve complex problems based on teacher feedback). Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) tools into education can augment students' knowledge, foster skill acquisition, and deepen comprehension of intricate medical topics [2,3]. Virtual reality (VR) can enhance the immersion of learning sessions with virtual patients. Virtual Reality (VR) is a software-driven technology that generates a virtual environment with three-dimensional characteristics. Virtual Reality (VR) uses a head-mounted display or glasses to build a computer-simulated environment that provides a convincing and lifelike experience for the user. Conversely, augmented reality (AR) enhances the real-world environment by superimposing virtual elements onto a user's perspective of the actual world through a smartphone or similar device. By integrating these technologies, learners are able to investigate and actively participate in intricate clinical situations, resulting in a more pleasurable and efficient learning experience [4,5]. AI-powered games utilise data mining methodologies to examine the data gathered during gameplay and enhance the player's knowledge and abilities. In addition, they provide a personalised and engaging encounter that adapts the speed and level of challenge according to the player's achievements. Incorporating game components such as points, badges, and leaderboards enhances the enjoyment and engagement of the learning process. The implementation of gamification in the learning process boosts student engagement, fosters collaborative efforts, and optimises learning results. Additionally, they offer chances for clinical decision-making without any potential risks and provide instant feedback to the students, thereby becoming an essential component of undergraduate medical education [6]. By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into learning management systems (LMS), learners are equipped with the necessary resources to achieve mastery at their own individualised pace. These computer algorithms assess the learner's level of understanding and deliver personalised educational material to help them achieve mastery of the content. The AI-powered platforms guide learners by effectively organising and arranging learning experiences, and then implementing targeted remedial actions. These customised and adaptable teaching techniques enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Virtual patients are computer-based simulations that replicate real-life clinical events and are used for training and education in health professions. Virtual patients are built to simulate authentic symptoms, react to students' treatments, and create dynamic therapeutic encounters. The student assumes the position of a healthcare provider and engages in activities such as gathering information, proposing potential diagnoses, implementing medical treatment, and monitoring the patient's progress. These simulations can accurately reproduce a range of medical settings and expose trainees to the problems they might encounter in real-world situations. Medical students can enhance their communication and clinical reasoning skills by engaging with virtual patients in a simulated environment that closely resembles real-life situations [6,7]. Furthermore, AI-driven solutions can be advantageous for educational purposes in diagnostic fields such as radiology, pathology, and microbiology. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a highly promising method utilised in the field of radiology for educational and research purposes. CBIR facilitates the search for photos that have similar content with a reference image, utilising information extracted from the images [8]. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) integrated with machine learning techniques is currently being employed to accurately diagnose microbial illnesses. This application of AI has significant potential in training and educating specialists in the field of microbiology. Conversely, the current progress in AI-driven deep learning technologies that specifically target cellular imaging has the potential to revolutionise education in diagnostic pathology [9]. Ultimately, incorporating AI training into the medical education curriculum is a transformative step that will shape the future of healthcare practitioners. This sequence provides enhanced diagnostic precision, personalised learning prospects, and heightened ethical awareness. These potential benefits surpass the obstacles, initiating a new era in medical education where human beings and technology collaborate to deliver optimal patient care. The purposeful and calculated integration of AI into medical education will have a pivotal impact on shaping the future of healthcare as we navigate this unexplored territory. "

- **Reasoning:** Proposes a tiered AI literacy framework but lacks concrete AI personalization, equity focus, or research‑curriculum integration; no empirical or fairness analysis.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, yet its integration into medical education remains inconsistent and lacks standardization across training levels. This comprehensive review synthesizes current research on AI applications within medical education, highlighting significant gaps between the growing clinical role of AI and its representation in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The review identifies disparities in AI awareness and utilization, with postgraduate trainees demonstrating greater familiarity than undergraduates, and notes that most existing educational efforts are concentrated in specialty training and continuing education, particularly in fields such as radiology, pathology, surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. While medical trainees generally express positive attitudes toward acquiring AI competencies, barriers such as the absence of standardized frameworks and AI taxonomy, limited faculty expertise, curricular constraints, and ethical considerations impede broader adoption. Drawing on examples of pioneering programs and a systematic analysis of curricular approaches, we propose a novel, tiered framework for comprehensive AI integration across the medical education continuum. This framework emphasizes universal AI literacy, critical evaluation skills, ethical awareness, and experiential learning at the undergraduate level, with extensions for specialty-specific training and advanced technical or leadership tracks. Recommendations include phased implementation strategies, faculty development initiatives, including “teach the teacher”, and competency-based assessment methods. The review concludes that adequate preparation of future physicians requires a shift from isolated AI initiatives to coordinated, longitudinal integration efforts supported by collaboration among educational institutions, professional societies, and technology experts. Future research should focus on evaluating educational outcomes, developing robust assessment tools for AI competencies, and examining the long-term clinical impact of AI training. "

- **Reasoning:** Proposes a tiered AI literacy framework for medical training, but lacks AI-driven personalization, research integration, and explicit focus on health equity or inclusive outcomes.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, yet its integration into medical education remains inconsistent and lacks standardization across training levels. This comprehensive review synthesizes current research on AI applications within medical education, highlighting significant gaps between the growing clinical role of AI and its representation in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The review identifies disparities in AI awareness and utilization, with postgraduate trainees demonstrating greater familiarity than undergraduates, and notes that most existing educational efforts are concentrated in specialty training and continuing education, particularly in fields such as radiology, pathology, surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. While medical trainees generally express positive attitudes toward acquiring AI competencies, barriers such as the absence of standardized frameworks and AI taxonomy, limited faculty expertise, curricular constraints, and ethical considerations impede broader adoption. Drawing on examples of pioneering programs and a systematic analysis of curricular approaches, we propose a novel, tiered framework for comprehensive AI integration across the medical education continuum. This framework emphasizes universal AI literacy, critical evaluation skills, ethical awareness, and experiential learning at the undergraduate level, with extensions for specialty-specific training and advanced technical or leadership tracks. Recommendations include phased implementation strategies, faculty development initiatives, including “teach the teacher”, and competency-based assessment methods. The review concludes that adequate preparation of future physicians requires a shift from isolated AI initiatives to coordinated, longitudinal integration efforts supported by collaboration among educational institutions, professional societies, and technology experts. Future research should focus on evaluating educational outcomes, developing robust assessment tools for AI competencies, and examining the long-term clinical impact of AI training. "

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on AI for general inclusive education, not healthcare; lacks medical curriculum, research integration, or health‑specific personalization.","Inclusive education advocates for equal learning opportunities for all students, irrespective of their abilities or backgrounds. The invention of artificial intelligence and modern technologies opens new avenues for improving each child's learning experience—regardless of their skills and backgrounds—by promoting inclusive education through offering personalized learning experiences and supporting diverse learning needs, thus fostering a completely inclusive learning environment. By applying AI technologies, educators can design more effective, inclusive, and engaging curricula, differentiating their requirements with the diversified needs of today's learners toward more equitable and innovative educational learning for each type of learner. This research views the present applications of AI in inclusive education as (a) assistive technologies as per the need of every student, (b) personalized learning, and (c) inclusive assessment tools (IATs) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). This research looks into the following benefits of AI in inclusive education: (a) enhanced accessibility, (b) data-driven decision-making, (b) improved engagement, (d) early intervention, and (e) continuous enhancement. Some of the challenges and ethical issues that AI in inclusive education raises are data privacy, data security, teacher training and support, costs, and access. This study also sheds light on the future direction: for instance, R&D in AI for inclusive education, policy and regulations, collaboration, and partnerships of different stakeholders. The findings and implications of this study will help educators, practitioners, and policymakers to make decisions for the effective use of AI and new technologies in enhancing every student's learning experience.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on AI in general higher‑education learning, not on healthcare, medical curricula, or inclusive health outcomes; lacks the required healthcare context.","The integration of Generative AI tools in higher education offers promising avenues for enhancing personalized and inclusive learning but also presents significant challenges. This study investigates these complexities, focusing on personalized learning, inclusivity, faculty preparedness, and ethical considerations. Employing a mixed-methods research design, the study surveyed and interviewed students and faculty members from multiple higher education institutions. Using stratified random sampling, 300 students and 100 faculty members were selected. The study found that 85% of students reported enhanced engagement and academic performance due to AI's personalized learning capabilities. However, some students preferred traditional methods of teaching. In terms of inclusivity, 75% of students felt that AI tools were accessible and culturally diverse, although concerns about algorithmic biases were raised. Faculty preparedness emerged as a significant factor, with 60% of faculty members feeling inadequately prepared to effectively use AI tools, citing technical and ethical challenges. Ethical considerations were a major concern, with 70% of participants worried about data privacy and security, and 50% raising issues related to algorithmic bias. These findings align with existing literature, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to AI integration, faculty training programs, and ethical guidelines. The study offers valuable insights for future research and practical implementations in higher education. It also underscores the urgency for educational institutions to address these challenges to fully harness the benefits of AI in academic settings. "
