The treatment and management of complex chronic diseases, such as diabetes, stands to benefit from novel AI algorithms analyzing the frequent real-time streaming data and the occasional medical diagnostics and laboratory test results reported in electronic health records (EHR). Novel algorithms are needed to develop trustworthy, responsible, reliable, and robust AI techniques that can handle the imperfect and imbalanced data of EHRs and inconsistencies or discrepancies with free-living self-reported information. The challenges and applications of AI for two problems in the healthcare domain were explored in this work. First, we introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes. Then, we studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data. Application examples in the treatment of diabetes demonstrate the benefits of AI tools for medical and health informatics.","This work introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes and studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data."

Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population. ","This study proposes a multimodal deep learning architecture that integrates continuous glucose monitoring data with physiological context from health records to predict interstitial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients with high accuracy (up to 96.7%) and low error (MAPE 6-26 mg/dL)."

The state of the art of BG prediction has been achieved by leveraging advanced deep learning methods to model multi-modal data, i.e., sensor data and self-reported event data, organised as multi-variate time series (MTS). However, these methods are mostly regarded as ``black boxes'' and not entirely trusted by clinicians and patients. In this paper, we propose interpretable graph attentive recurrent neural networks (GARNNs) to model MTS, explaining variable contributions via summarizing variable importance and generating feature maps by graph attention mechanisms instead of post-hoc analysis. We evaluate GARNNs on four datasets, representing diverse clinical scenarios. Upon comparison with twelve well-established baseline methods, GARNNs not only achieve the best prediction accuracy but also provide high-quality temporal interpretability, in particular for postprandial glucose levels as a result of corresponding meal intake and insulin injection. These findings underline the potential of GARNN as a robust tool for improving diabetes care, bridging the gap between deep learning technology and real-world healthcare solutions.

However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability.

Different to existing methods that take the past glucose sequence as the input and output the future sequence, the method we apply — referred to as the meta-optimised time-index model (MOTIM) — takes time-index features as the input and predicts the glucose value at that time. We argue that the reduction of modeling complexity from sequence-level to value-level could ease the learning difficulty and increase the efficiency. In our experiments on the OhioT1DM and UMT1DM datasets, the MOTIM achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models (e.g., 1-hour excursion averaged mean absolute percentage error of 10.25 on OhioT1DM and 12.50 on UMT1DM) while consuming a substantially lower cost (e.g., only 1.3% model parameters and more than 10 times faster inference). These promising findings encourage further work on time-index modeling in glucose prediction for T1DM, and to encourage it, we have released our codes at https://github.com/r-cui/MOTIMGluPred under the MIT license.","This study proposes a meta-optimised time-index model (MOTIM) for glucose excursion prediction in type 1 diabetes mellitus, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity and inference cost by 90% and 10x, respectively."

Moreover, we conduct the experimental evaluation using two diabetes patient datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating realistic counterfactual changes in comparison with a baseline approach.

Owing to the complexity of the blood glucose dynamics, it is difficult to design accurate predictive models in every circumstance, i.e., hypo/normo/hyperglycemic events. We developed deep-learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patient-specific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5 min to 1 h. In general, the major challenges to address are (1) the dataset of each patient is often too small to train a patient-specific deep-learning model, and (2) the dataset is usually highly imbalanced given that hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes are usually much less common than normoglycemia. We tackle these two challenges using transfer learning and data augmentation, respectively. We systematically examined three neural network architectures, different loss functions, four transfer-learning strategies, and four data augmentation techniques, including mixup and generative models. Taken together, utilizing these methodologies we achieved over 95% prediction accuracy and 90% sensitivity for a time period within the clinically useful 1 h prediction horizon that would allow a patient to react and correct either hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. We have also demonstrated that the same network architecture and transfer-learning methods perform well for the type 1 diabetes OhioT1DM public dataset.","In this article, the authors developed deep learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patientspecific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5min to 1h."

In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. 1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. 2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. 3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) facilitates blood glucose level prediction (BGLP), allowing for timely interventions based on insulin delivery and carbohydrate intake to prevent complications. Current research has developed sequential models to predict BGLP, incorporating historical BG data along with factors like meal and insulin intake.

However, glucose predictions in the lower (hypoglycemia) and higher (hyperglycemia) extremes, referred as glycemic excursions, remain challenging due to their rarity. Moreover, limited access to sensitive patient data hampers the development of robust machine learning models even with advanced deep learning algorithms available. <italic>Methods:</italic> We propose to simultaneously provide accurate glucose predictions in the excursion regions while addressing data privacy concerns. To tackle excursion prediction, we propose a novel Hypo-Hyper (HH) loss function that penalizes errors based on the underlying glycemic range with a higher penalty at the extremes over the normal glucose range. On the other hand, to address privacy concerns, we propose FedGlu, a machine learning model trained in a federated learning (FL) framework. FL allows collaborative learning without sharing sensitive data by training models locally and sharing only model parameters across other patients. The HH loss combined within FedGlu addresses both the challenges at the same time. <italic>Results:</italic> The HH loss function demonstrates a 46% improvement over mean-squared error (MSE) loss across 125 patients. Compared to local models, FedGlu improved glycemic excursion detection by 35% compared to local models. This improvement translates to enhanced performance in predicting both, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, for 105 out of 125 patients. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed HH loss function in augmenting the predictive capabilities of glucose predictions.

Timely identification is critical to curb vision impairment. Algorithms for DR staging from digital fundus images (DFIs) have been recently proposed. However, models often fail to generalize due to distribution shifts between the source domain on which the model was trained and the target domain where it is deployed. A common and particularly challenging shift is often encountered when the source- and target-domain supports do not fully overlap. In this research, we introduce DRStageNet, a deep learning model designed to mitigate this challenge. We used seven publicly available datasets, comprising a total of 93,534 DFIs that cover a variety of patient demographics, ethnicities, geographic origins and comorbidities. We fine-tune DINOv2, a pretrained model of self-supervised vision transformer, and implement a multi-source domain fine-tuning strategy to enhance generalization performance. We benchmark and demonstrate the superiority of our method to two state-of-the-art benchmarks, including a recently published foundation model. We adapted the grad-rollout method to our regression task in order to provide high-resolution explainability heatmaps. The error analysis showed that 59\% of the main errors had incorrect reference labels. DRStageNet is accessible at URL [upon acceptance of the manuscript].","This research introduces DRStageNet, a deep learning model designed to mitigate the challenge of distribution shifts in diabetic retinopathy, and fine-tune DINOv2, a pretrained model of self-supervised vision transformer, and implement a multi-source domain fine-tuning strategy to enhance generalization performance."

Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and foot ulcers (DFU) occurrence through image analysis is in high demand as many individuals are left without any supervision due to the limited resources such as trained clinicians or suitable equipment especially, in rural areas. Furthermore, the existing system will become even more insufficient as the number of people with diabetes increases.

The IDA consists of knowledge-based modules for severity level-based classification, clinical decision support and near real-time foot ulcer detection and boundary screening. We use the System Usability Scale (SUS) in terms of performance, learnability, and satisfaction to measure the usability of the IDA.

In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of FL in the development of a deep learning model for screening diabetic retinopathy (DR) in fundus photographs. To this end, we conduct a simulated FL framework using nearly 700,000 fundus photographs collected from OPHDIAT, a French multi-center screening network for detecting DR. We develop two FL algorithms: 1) a cross-center FL algorithm using data distributed across the OPHDIAT centers and 2) a cross-grader FL algorithm using data distributed across the OPHDIAT graders. We explore and assess different FL strategies and compare them to a conventional learning algorithm, namely centralized learning (CL), where all the data is stored in a centralized repository.

Timely and correct diagnosis of diabetes and its complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, is important in its management and prognosis. However, medical prognosis using machine learning approaches is still challenging work with complicated and high-dimensional data. During the past years, various machine learning algorithms have been applied to help both clinicians and patients in medical prognosis. But few have been investigated in deep learning field, except for recently in cancer prognosis research. The development of big data in healthcare and medical fields provides a great opportunity for applying deep learning algorithms in medical diagnosis and prognosis. The personalized analysis and efficient management of all those high-dimensional and complicated medical data becomes feasible through the use of deep learning.

Early identification of patients at risk of these microvascular complications using predictive models through machine learning (ML) can be helpful in T1D management. The objective of current review was to systematically identify and summarize published predictive models that used ML to assess the risk of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy in T1D patients.
 Methods: A targeted review of English literature was undertaken in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) from January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. Eligible articles were also identified from cross-references. Following concepts were used in combination to conduct the search queries: diabetes, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, microvascular complication, risk/predictive model, and ML/artificial intelligence/data mining.
 Results: A total of 3,769 hits were found from all sources combined, duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were screened, 61 studies underwent full-text review and a total of six studies met the eligibility criteria. Among them, four studies had developed risk models using data obtained from T1D patients alone, whereas two used data from both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. There was only one study that evaluated all three types of microvascular complications while the other five focused on one individual complication, i.e., either diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. Only two studies evaluated time to developing a complication. The other four studies assessed complications as either binary (yes/no) or categorical (multiple levels). Prediction models were built using cross-sectional data from survey questionnaire (n=1, Iran) and longitudinal data (n=5) which were further classified as sources of electronic medical records (EMR) (n=3, US: 1, Europe: 2), clinical trial (n=1, US) and prospective study (n=1, Europe). Common predictors across studies as well as across types of microvascular complications included age, gender, diabetes duration, BMI, blood pressure, lipid level, and mean or a single HbA1C value. Commonly used ML algorithms included classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF) (CART/RF, n=3), support vector machines (SVMs, n=2), logistic regression (LR, n=2) and neural networks (NNs, n=1). Model performance was evaluated using area under curve (AUC, n=4) and accuracy (n=2). Only half (n=3) of the included studies tested their developed models in an external dataset of patients with T1D. Conclusions: Overall, very few studies reported predictive models for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy using ML specifically for T1D patients.

However, collaboratively training a DR staging model across multiple institutions remains a challenge due to non-iid data, client reliability, and confidence evaluation of the prediction. To address these issues, we propose a novel federated uncertainty-aware aggregation paradigm (FedUAA), which considers the reliability of each client and produces a confidence estimation for the DR staging. In our FedUAA, an aggregated encoder is shared by all clients for learning a global representation of fundus images, while a novel temperature-warmed uncertainty head (TWEU) is utilized for each client for local personalized staging criteria. Our TWEU employs an evidential deep layer to produce the uncertainty score with the DR staging results for client reliability evaluation. Furthermore, we developed a novel uncertainty-aware weighting module (UAW) to dynamically adjust the weights of model aggregation based on the uncertainty score distribution of each client. In our experiments, we collect five publicly available datasets from different institutions to conduct a dataset for federated DR staging to satisfy the real non-iid condition. The experimental results demonstrate that our FedUAA achieves better DR staging performance with higher reliability compared to other federated learning methods. Our proposed FedUAA paradigm effectively addresses the challenges of collaboratively training DR staging models across multiple institutions, and provides a robust and reliable solution for the deployment of DR diagnosis models in real-world clinical scenarios.

In this study, we look at this problem from the perspective of the forecasting of future glucose values for diabetic people. In this study, we propose the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function. It penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on dangerous regions. In order to use the loss function in practice, we propose an algorithm that progressively improves the clinical acceptability of the model, so that we can achieve the best tradeoff possible between accuracy and given clinical criteria. We evaluate the approaches using two diabetes datasets, one having type-1 patients and the other type-2 patients. The results show that using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the models. In particular, the improvements are significant in the hypoglycemia region. We also show that this increased clinical acceptability comes at the cost of a decrease in the average accuracy of the model. Finally, we show that this tradeoff between accuracy and clinical acceptability can be successfully addressed with the proposed algorithm. For given clinical criteria, the algorithm can find the optimal solution that maximizes the accuracy while at the same meeting the criteria.","In this article, the authors proposed the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function, which penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction."

Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model on biomedical temporal data based on a transformer architecture, and trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 non-diabetic individuals. We tokenized the CGM training data and trained GluFormer using next token prediction in a generative, autoregressive manner. We demonstrate that GluFormer generalizes effectively to 15 different external datasets, including 4936 individuals across 5 different geographical regions, 6 different CGM devices, and several metabolic disorders, including normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic populations, as well as those with gestational diabetes and obesity. GluFormer produces embeddings which outperform traditional CGM analysis tools, and achieves high Pearson correlations in predicting clinical parameters such as HbA1c, liver-related parameters, blood lipids, and sleep-related indices. Notably, GluFormer can also predict onset of future health outcomes even 4 years in advance. We also show that CGM embeddings from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the enhanced model can accurately generate CGM data based only on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods.

However, diabetes diagnosis is still an arduous process, given that this disease develops and gets treated outside the clinic. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs) and machine learning points to a potential way forward to address this challenge. WMSs enable a continuous, yet user-transparent, mechanism to collect and analyze physiological signals. However, disease diagnosis based on WMS data and its effective deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging due to inefficient feature extraction and vast computation cost. To address these problems, we propose a framework called DiabDeep that combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with off-the-shelf WMSs for pervasive diabetes diagnosis. DiabDeep bypasses the feature extraction stage and acts directly on WMS data. It enables both an (i) accurate inference on the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on an edge device, e.g., a smartphone, to obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals. On the resource-rich server, we stack sparsely connected layers to deliver high accuracy. On the resource-scarce edge device, we use a hidden-layer long short-term memory based recurrent layer to substantially cut down on computation and storage costs while incurring only a minor accuracy loss. At the core of our system lies a grow-and-prune training flow: it leverages gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning algorithms to enable DiabNNs to learn both weights and connections, while improving accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiabDeep through a detailed analysis of data collected from 52 participants. For server (edge) side inference, we achieve a 96.3 percent (95.3 percent) accuracy in classifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7 percent (94.6 percent) accuracy in distinguishing among type-1 diabetic, type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals. Against conventional baselines, such as support vector machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and linear ridge classifiers, DiabNNs achieve higher accuracy, while reducing the model size (floating-point operations) by up to 454.5× (8.9×). Therefore, the system can be viewed as pervasive and efficient, yet very accurate.","DiabDeep as mentioned in this paper combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with off-the-shelf wearable medical sensors (WMSs) for pervasive diabetes diagnosis, which enables both accurate inference on the server and efficient inference on an edge device to obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals."

Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions.

Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Conclusion GlucoNet‐MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy‐aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has provided a convenient approach for comprehensive blood glucose data collection. Despite the widespread use of CGM in clinical practice, we yet have reliable methods to extract meaningful information from short-term CGM sensor data to conveniently assess HbA1c and GA levels in diabetics. In this work, we propose a multitask model called HbA1c and GA multitask levels assessment model (HGMLA) to simultaneously assess HbA1c and GA levels with short-term CGM sensor data to get comprehensive knowledge of relatively long-term glycemic control. Multiscale convolutional kernels and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are utilized in the model to extract glucose fluctuation features at different time scales. Meanwhile, we transform the 1-D glucose sequence into a 2-D tensor and use 2-D convolution to extract the glucose trend features. In addition, specific CGM manual features are extracted, and multitask learning (MTL) framework is employed to simultaneously assess HbA1c and GA levels. Experiments on a dataset of 1378 subjects demonstrated that the HGMLA is able to achieve better performance on both HbA1c and GA assessment tasks compared with fully connected (FC) neural networks and mainstream machine learning models, such as XGBoost and SVM, with an accuracy (ACC) of 86.59% and 84.42% for two assessment tasks, respectively. Our model enables the assessment of relatively long-term glycemic control in diabetes patients using short-term CGM data, which assists clinicians in formulating more precise treatment options.","This study proposes HGMLA, a multitask learning model that assesses HbA1c and GA levels using short-term CGM sensor data, achieving 86.59% and 84.42% accuracy, respectively, outperforming mainstream machine learning models and enabling more precise treatment options for diabetes patients."

In this study, we look at this problem from the perspective of the forecasting of future glucose values for diabetic people. In this study, we propose the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function. It penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on dangerous regions. In order to use the loss function in practice, we propose an algorithm that progressively improves the clinical acceptability of the model, so that we can achieve the best tradeoff possible between accuracy and given clinical criteria. We evaluate the approaches using two diabetes datasets, one having type-1 patients and the other type-2 patients. The results show that using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the models. In particular, the improvements are significant in the hypoglycemia region. We also show that this increased clinical acceptability comes at the cost of a decrease in the average accuracy of the model. Finally, we show that this tradeoff between accuracy and clinical acceptability can be successfully addressed with the proposed algorithm. For given clinical criteria, the algorithm can find the optimal solution that maximizes the accuracy while at the same meeting the criteria.","This study proposes a novel loss function, gcMSE, to integrate clinical criteria into deep models for glucose prediction in diabetic people, improving clinical acceptability, particularly in hypoglycemia regions, while addressing the tradeoff between accuracy and clinical acceptability."

Developing a reliable glucose forecasting model would have a profound impact on diabetes management, since it could provide predictive glucose alarms or insulin suspension at low-glucose for hypoglycemia minimisation. Recently, deep learning has shown great potential in healthcare and medical research for diagnosis, forecasting and decision-making. In this work, we introduce a deep learning model based on a dilated recurrent neural network (DRNN) to provide 30-min forecasts of future glucose levels. Using dilation, the DRNN model gains a much larger receptive field in terms of neurons aiming at capturing long-term dependencies. A transfer learning technique is also applied to make use of the data from multiple subjects. The proposed approach outperforms existing glucose forecasting algorithms, including autoregressive models (ARX), support vector regression (SVR) and conventional neural networks for predicting glucose (NNPG) (e.g. RMSE = NNPG, 22.9 mg/dL; SVR, 21.7 mg/dL; ARX, 20.1 mg/dl; DRNN, 18.9 mg/dL on the OhioT1DM dataset).

Methods: Between June 2018 and March 2022, adults with T1D with incident DR or no retinopathy (control) were identified. The CGM data were collected retrospectively for up to seven years before the date of defining incident DR or no retinopathy. A mixture of three machine learning algorithms was trained and evaluated in two different scenarios, using different glycemic features extracted from CGM traces (scenario 1), and the two principal components (two PCs; exposure to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia risk) of those features (scenario 2).

The asynchronous training framework supports flexible participation. By adjusting the ratios of inactive participants, we found it remains stable if less than 70% are inactive. Our results confirm that GluADFL offers a practical, privacy-preserved solution for BG prediction in T1D, significantly enhancing the quality of diabetes management.

However, existing research predom-inantly concentrates on short-term blood glucose forecasting, overlooking the critical need for accurate long-term prediction. This work addresses this gap by exploring the feasibility and efficacy of long-term blood glucose prediction (60, 120, and 240 minutes) leveraging deep multitask learning (DMTL). In addition, long-short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture has been explored within the shared layers of the DMTL framework. The predictive model effectively captures blood glucose trends, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 56.66±6.96 mg/dL at the 240-minute (four-hour) mark while maintaining 90.36±4.22 % predictions within clinically benign zones in the Clarke error grid. These predictions offer a strategic advantage in long-term care planning, facilitating proactive interventions to stabilize glycemic levels through insulin therapy and dietary intake adjustments.

To address these issues, we propose a novel federated uncertainty-aware aggregation paradigm (FedUAA), which considers the reliability of each client and produces a confidence estimation for the DR staging. In our FedUAA, an aggregated encoder is shared by all clients for learning a global representation of fundus images, while a novel temperature-warmed uncertainty head (TWEU) is utilized for each client for local personalized staging criteria.

Traditional diagnostic approaches are subject to human error, highlighting the need for modern computational techniques in clinical decision support systems. Although these systems have successfully integrated deep learning (DL) models, they still encounter several challenges, such as a lack of intricate pattern learning, imbalanced datasets, and poor interpretability of predictions. Methods: To address these issues, the temporal inception perceptron network (TIPNet), a novel DL model, is designed to accurately predict diabetes by capturing complex feature relationships and temporal dynamics.

Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL ( p &lt; 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support.

Digital approaches to maintaining tight glycaemic control, such as clinical decision support systems and artificial pancreas systems rely on continuous glucose monitoring devices and self-reported data, which is usually improved through glucose forecasting. In this work, we develop a multitask approach using convolutional recurrent neural networks (MTCRNN) to provide short-term forecasts using the OhioT1DM dataset which comprises 12 participants. We obtain the following results 30 min: 19.79±0.06 mg/dL (RMSE); 13.62±0.05 mg/dL (MAE) and 60 min: 33.73±0.24 mg/dL (RMSE); 24.54±0.15 mg/dL (MAE). Multitask learning facilitates an approach that allows for learning with the data from all available subjects, thereby overcoming the common challenge of insufficient individual datasets while learning appropriate individual models for each participant.","A multitask approach using convolutional recurrent neural networks (MTCRNN) to provide short-term forecasts using the OhioT1DM dataset which comprises 12 participants, thereby overcoming the common challenge of insufficient individual datasets while learning appropriate individual models for each participant."

Maruf Hossain Shuvo","10.32469/10355/105044","","Diabetes is a complex of metabolic disorders that disrupts the autonomous regulation of blood glucose concentration in human body. This chronic condition requires consistent medical monitoring and management to avert acute complications. Inadequate glycemic control can result in impaired cellular function and tissue damage across multiple organs, ultimately culminating in organ failure. Effective glucose regulation demands continuous monitoring and precise decision-making by individuals with the disease. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a promising approach to enhance the diagnosis and management of the disease. This dissertation proposes and develops efficient edge AI and deep learning (DL) techniques to address the challenges associated with the diagnosis and management of diabetes. The first study uses medical health records implementing different machine learning (ML) methods to develop a risk assessment tool to generate user-specific binary recommendations (high and low chances of developing diabetes). The pre-trained ML model embedded into a smartphone application takes answers to patient-related questions as input and provides feedback on the likelihood of developing diabetes. The second study implements a neural network inference on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to automatically predict diabetes from clinical measurements. The inference of the best-trained model has been realized in hardware to develop intelligent diabetes detection tools. The third study seeks to build an advisory tool utilizing predictive analytics to generate personalized blood glucose forecasts. Deep multitask learning (MTL) is proposed to enhance the personalized prediction of blood glucose levels. Consistently leading performance was obtained within the clinically acceptable regimen for multi-step prediction horizons. Finally, an ablation study comprehensively investigates the systematic integration of highly relevant life events and physiological parameters with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to understand the synergy in glucoregulatory systems. The proposed edge AI and deep learning tools and techniques demonstrate promising results in diabetes risk assessment, diagnosis, and personalized management with the potential integration into the CDSS and aid in medical decisions through better therapeutic and lifestyle modification.","This dissertation proposes edge AI and deep learning techniques for precision diabetes diagnosis and management, developing risk assessment tools, predictive analytics, and personalized blood glucose forecasts to aid in medical decisions and improve glycemic control."

Consequently, it becomes crucial to be able to monitor and predict the incidence of diabetes. Machine learning approaches have been proposed and evaluated in the literature for diabetes prediction. This paper proposes an IoT-edge-Artificial Intelligence (AI)-blockchain system for diabetes prediction based on risk factors. The proposed system is underpinned by the blockchain to obtain a cohesive view of the risk factors data from patients across different hospitals and to ensure security and privacy of the user's data. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of different medical sensors, devices, and methods to measure and collect the risk factors values in the system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out between our proposed system, using the most accurate random forest (RF) model, and the two most used state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using three real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that the proposed system delivers predicts diabetes using RF with 4.57% more accuracy on average in comparison with the other models LR and SVM, with 2.87 times more execution time. Data balancing without feature selection does not show significant improvement.

In this paper, we explore the RETAIN architecture for the task of glusose forecasting for diabetic people. By using a two-level attention mechanism, the recurrent-neural-network-based RETAIN model is interpretable. We evaluate the RETAIN model on the type-2 IDIAB and the type-1 OhioT1DM datasets by comparing its statistical and clinical performances against two deep models and three models based on decision trees. We show that the RETAIN model offers a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable. We show the usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than one hour are not used by the RETAIN model for the 30-minutes ahead of time prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions. In particular, it showed that the patient's state before the event is particularily important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to its interpretability, seems to be a very promissing model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare.","The RETAIN model seems to be a very promising model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable."
