Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for ""what-if"" models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability.

Currently, machine learning (ML) models are being constructed on local healthcare systems and are validated internally with no expectation that they would validate externally and thus, are rarely transferrable to a different healthcare system. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: .73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare system (concordance: .62-.90). We believe that our modeling approach, in which a model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit from precision medicine.","It is demonstrated that even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, while a model constructed on a local healthcare system’s cohort is difficult to transfer."

Data pre-processing includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and selection. Model performance is assessed through accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision-recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency. Findings reveal that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (93%) but required post-hoc explainability. Logistic Regression provided inherent interpretability but with lower accuracy (81%). SHAP identified glucose, BMI, and age as key diabetes predictors, offering robust global explanations at a higher computational cost. LIME, with lower computational overhead, provided localized insights but lacked comprehensive interpretability. SHAP’s exponential complexity limits real-time deployment, while LIME’s linear complexity makes it more practical for clinical decision support.These insights underscore the importance of XAI in enhancing transparency and trust in AI-driven healthcare.

Diabetes is a deadly chronic disease that has affected the health of many people causing several other health issues, like heart stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, etc. According to reports, approximately 422 million people have diabetes on a worldwide scale, the majority of them from economically developing countries. The cases of diabetes in India have risen from 7.1% in 2009 to 8.9% in 2019. Currently, 25.2 million people have IGT (Impaired glucose tolerance) and it is most likely to increase to 35.7 million by the year 2045.

Recent findings Driven by a single gene mutation, monogenic diabetes remains the best use-case for precision diabetes care. However, the increasing prevalence of diabetes among adolescents and young adults in an obesogenic environment makes triaging potential patients for genetic screening clinically challenging. High-dimensional molecular biomarkers (i.e., multiomics) can improve the risk prediction for incident type 2 diabetes (T2D), over and above a well established prediction model based on clinical variables alone. Machine learning approaches using clinical variable-based clustering methods have generated novel and reproducible T2D subgroups with distinct phenotypic and omics characteristics that are associated with differential long-term outcomes. This stratification-strategy may inform clinical decisions. However, on-going discussion and research will be needed to understand the clinical utility of sub-phenotyping T2D for precision care. Summary Precision diabetes care has extended from uncommon monogenic diabetes to T2D which will need more complex approaches like multiomics and machine-learning methods.

We validate the importance of these dimensions by implementing a proof-of-concept (POC) in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) use case where we assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a common T2DM comorbidity. Within the POC, we include risk prediction models for CKD, post-hoc explainers of the predictions, and other natural-language modules which operationalize domain knowledge and CPGs to provide context. With primary care physicians (PCP) as our end-users, we present our initial results and clinician feedback in this paper. Our POC approach covers multiple knowledge sources and clinical scenarios, blends knowledge to explain data and predictions to PCPs, and received an enthusiastic response from our medical expert.","In this article, a proof-of-concept (POC) was implemented in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) use case where they assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) -a common T2DM comorbidity."

Therefore, a framework that can accurately forecast a large number of patients based on clinical details is needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field, and its implementations to diabetes, a worldwide pandemic, have the potential to revolutionize the strategy of diagnosing and forecasting this chronic condition. Algorithms based on artificial intelligence fundamentals have been developed to support predictive models for the risk of developing diabetes or its complications. In this review, we will discuss AI-based diabetes prediction. Thus, AI-based new-onset diabetes prediction has not beaten the statistically based risk stratification models, in traditional risk stratification models. Despite this, it is anticipated that in the near future, a vast quantity of well-organized data and an abundance of processing power will optimize AI's predictive capabilities, greatly enhancing the accuracy of diabetic illness prediction models.

Its increasing global prevalence necessitates the development of accurate and efficient predictive algorithms to support timely diagnosis. While recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have demonstrated potential for diabetes prediction, conventional models face limitations in handling class imbalance, capturing complex feature interactions, and providing interpretability for clinical decision-making. This paper proposes a DL framework for diabetes mellitus prediction. The framework ensures high predictive accuracy by integrating advanced preprocessing, effective class balancing, and a novel EchoceptionNet model. An analysis was conducted on a diabetes prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle, comprising nine features and 100,000 instances. The dataset is characterized by severe class imbalance, which is effectively addressed using a proximity-weighted synthetic oversampling technique, ensuring balanced class distribution. EchoceptionNet demonstrated notable performance improvements over state-of-the-art deep learning models, achieving a 4.39% increase in accuracy, 8.99% in precision, 2.19% in recall, 5.55% in F1-score, and a 7.77% in area under the curve score. Model robustness and generalizability were validated through 10-fold cross-validation, demonstrating consistent performance across diverse data splitting. To enhance clinical applicability, EchoceptionNet integrates explainable artificial intelligence techniques, Shapley additive explanations, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. These methods provide transparency by identifying the critical importance of features in the model’s predictions. EchoceptionNet exhibits superior predictive accuracy and ensures interpretability and reliability, making it a robust solution for accurate diabetes prediction.

In this paper, we explore the RETAIN architecture for the task of glusose forecasting for diabetic people. By using a two-level attention mechanism, the recurrent-neural-network-based RETAIN model is interpretable. We evaluate the RETAIN model on the type-2 IDIAB and the type-1 OhioT1DM datasets by comparing its statistical and clinical performances against two deep models and three models based on decision trees. We show that the RETAIN model offers a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable. We show the usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than one hour are not used by the RETAIN model for the 30-minutes ahead of time prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions. In particular, it showed that the patient's state before the event is particularily important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to its interpretability, seems to be a very promissing model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare.","The RETAIN model seems to be a very promising model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable."

The clinical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents a significant challenge due to the constantly evolving clinical practice guidelines and growing array of drug classes available. Evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have proven to be effective in assisting clinicians with informed decision-making. Despite the merits of AI-driven CDSSs, a significant research gap exists concerning the early-stage implementation and adoption of AI-enabled CDSSs in T2DM management.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to explore the perspectives of clinicians on the use and impact of the AI-enabled Prescription Advisory (APA) tool, developed using a multi-institution diabetes registry and implemented in specialist endocrinology clinics, and the challenges to its adoption and application.


METHODS
We conducted focus group discussions using a semistructured interview guide with purposively selected endocrinologists from a tertiary hospital. The focus group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were thematically analyzed.


RESULTS
A total of 13 clinicians participated in 4 focus group discussions. Our findings suggest that the APA tool offered several useful features to assist clinicians in effectively managing T2DM. Specifically, clinicians viewed the AI-generated medication alterations as a good knowledge resource in supporting the clinician's decision-making on drug modifications at the point of care, particularly for patients with comorbidities. The complication risk prediction was seen as positively impacting patient care by facilitating early doctor-patient communication and initiating prompt clinical responses. However, the interpretability of the risk scores, concerns about overreliance and automation bias, and issues surrounding accountability and liability hindered the adoption of the APA tool in clinical practice.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the APA tool holds great potential as a valuable resource for improving patient care, further efforts are required to address clinicians' concerns and improve the tool's acceptance and applicability in relevant contexts.","The APA tool offers useful features to assist clinicians in managing T2DM, but challenges to its adoption and application exist.

Physicians need to assess whether future glycemic control will be poor on the current trajectory of usual care and usual-care treatment intensifications so that they can consider taking extra treatment measures to prevent poor outcomes. Predicting poor glycemic control from trends in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels is difficult due to the influence of seasonal fluctuations and other factors. Objective We sought to develop a model that accurately predicts poor glycemic control among patients with T2D receiving usual care. Methods Our machine learning model predicts poor glycemic control (HbA1c≥8%) using the transformer architecture, incorporating an attention mechanism to process irregularly spaced HbA1c time series and quantify temporal relationships of past HbA1c levels at each time point. We assessed the model using HbA1c levels from 7787 patients with T2D seeing specialist physicians at the University of Tokyo Hospital. The training data include instances of poor glycemic control occurring during usual care with usual-care treatment intensifications. We compared prediction accuracy, assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the precision-recall curve, and the accuracy rate, to that of LightGBM. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the precision-recall curve, and the accuracy rate (95% confidence limits) of the proposed model were 0.925 (95% CI 0.923-0.928), 0.864 (95% CI 0.852-0.875), and 0.864 (95% CI 0.86-0.869), respectively. The proposed model achieved high prediction accuracy comparable to or surpassing LightGBM’s performance. The model prioritized the most recent HbA1c levels for predictions. Older HbA1c levels in patients with poor glycemic control were slightly more influential in predictions compared to patients with good glycemic control. Conclusions The proposed model accurately predicts poor glycemic control for patients with T2D receiving usual care, including patients receiving usual-care treatment intensifications, allowing physicians to identify cases warranting extraordinary treatment intensifications. If used by a nonspecialist, the model’s indication of likely future poor glycemic control may warrant a referral to a specialist.

Accordingly, recent studies have used multiple simple rules to adequately explain the diagnostic process and results to patients. However, this can cause patient confusion as the rules vary. Hence, this study proposes a deep neural network (DNN) with random forest (RF) and modified random forest incremental interpretation (MRFII) approach for diagnosing diabetes. This method first entails constructing a DNN to predict the probability of a patient having diabetes. To make the prediction result explainable, an RF is built to explain the process and results in terms of multiple simple decision rules. Additionally, to eliminate patient confusion, the MRFII is proposed to sort and aggregate the decision rules for a specific patient. A certainty mechanism is also established to feed back the explanation results from RF to improve the effectiveness of the DNN.

This paper proposes using machine learning techniques to recommend insulin values for better management of blood glucose levels. We utilize a Glucose Monitoring device, FreeStyle Libre, and a dataset comprising blood glucose levels, BMI, physical activity, and insulin values. Our primary mission is to utilize the power of machine learning to recommend insulin levels, empowering us to understand and manage diabetes more effectively. This involves exploring methods like decision tree regression, random forest regression, and linear regression to ensure precise determination of insulin values. The random forest regression demonstrates impressive performance, achieving an R-square value of 0.96. Additionally, we employ explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), to gain insights into the decision-making process of the models. While insulin therapy is essential for many with diabetes, alternative treatments may be suitable. For example, Type 2 individuals with blood glucose levels below 250mg/dL can manage with oral medications, while pregnant women with gestational diabetes may need dietary changes and medications. Additionally, those with pre-diabetes can often prevent or delay progression through lifestyle changes, without insulin therapy. Our research findings hold promise for improving diabetes management and patient outcomes.","This study proposes machine learning models, including decision tree and random forest regression, to predict personalized insulin dosages for diabetes management, achieving an R-square value of 0.96, and employs XAI methods for model interpretability."

This study presents an explainable dual-prediction framework that simultaneously forecasts postprandial hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia within a 4-hour window using cluster-personalized ensemble models. Glycemic profiles were identified through a hybrid unsupervised approach combining self-organizing maps and k-means clustering, enabling the training of specialized random forest classifiers. The system outperformed baseline models on both real-world and simulated datasets, achieving high performance (AUC = 0.84 and 0.93; MCC = 0.47 and 0.73 for hypo- and hyperglycemia, respectively). Model interpretability was addressed using global (SHAP) and local (LIME) explanations, while interaction analysis revealed the non-linear effects of carbohydrate intake and insulin bolus combinations. An insulin adjustment module further refined pre-meal bolus recommendations based on predicted risk. Simulated evaluations confirmed improved postprandial time-in-range and reduced hypoglycemia without excessive hyperglycemia. These results underscore the potential of profile-driven and explainable machine learning approaches to support safer, individualized diabetes care.

Shabana Mehfuz","10.1049/icp.2022.0608","","Diabetes has become a worldwide epidemic as a chronic disease. Early detection of diabetes without specialized medical instruments may positively impact people's lives. This research aims to construct an intelligent system that uses a machine learning approach to classify diabetic illness. ALTHOUGH, most AI methods are based on mathematical modelling, which is difficult for the common person to comprehend. This research proposes a novel approach within the Explainable AI to explain the knowledge learned by the Machine learning model from Smart Healthcare. Innovative healthcare uses the current generation of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing to completely revolutionize the medical system, making it more efficient and personalized. This work proposes three techniques based on the analysis weights of artificial neurons or nearest neighbors and explaining estimation based on the analysis of training cases. Here, a model is developed with three classifiers to detect diabetes early and explain the most significant input and combination of inputs. The results show remarkable accuracy compared to previous methods, and the explanation makes sense. The hybrid intelligent system can assist medical practitioners in healthcare as a decision support system.","This research proposes a novel approach within the Explainable AI to explain the knowledge learned by the Machine learning model from Smart Healthcare, and proposes three techniques based on the analysis weights of artificial neurons or nearest neighbors and explaining estimation based upon the analysis of training cases."

Yet, access to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible, and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 - 2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct links to each longitudinal diabetes dataset in the Glucose-ML collection and openly provide our code.","Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly available diabetes datasets, is presented to accelerate development of robust AI solutions for diabetes management, comprising over 300,000 days of CGM data from 2500+ individuals across 4 countries."
