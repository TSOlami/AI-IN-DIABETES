Numerous incidences of DR may be avoided if it were identified and addressed promptly. Throughout recent years, many deep learning (DL)-based algorithms have been proposed to facilitate psychometric testing. Utilizing DL model that encompassed four scenarios, DR and its stages were identified in this study using retinal scans from the ""Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 Blindness Detection"" dataset. Adopting a DL model then led to the use of augmentation strategies that produced a comprehensive dataset with consistent hyper parameters across all test cases. As a further step in the classification process, we used a Convolutional Neural Network model. Different enhancement methods have been used to raise visual quality. The proposed approach detected the DR with a highest experimental result of 97.83%, a top-2 accuracy of 99.31%, and a top-3 accuracy of 99.88% across all the 5 severity stages of the APTOS 2019 evaluation employing CLAHE and ESRGAN techniques for image enhancement. In addition, we employed APTOS 2019 to develop a set of evaluation metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) to use in analyzing the efficacy of the suggested model. The proposed approach was also proven to be more efficient at DR location than both state-of-the-art technology and conventional DL.

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication associated with diabetes, particularly affecting individuals between the ages of 18 and 65. As per the findings of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, 35–60% of individuals suffering from DR possess a diabetes history. DR emerges as a leading cause of worldwide visual impairment. Due to the absence of ophthalmologists worldwide, insufficient health resources, and healthcare services, patients cannot get timely eye screening services. Automated computer-aided detection of DR provides a wide range of potential benefits. In contrast to traditional observer-driven techniques, automatic detection allows for a more objective analysis of numerous images in a shorter time. Moreover, Unsupervised Learning (UL) holds a high potential for image classification in healthcare, particularly regarding explainability and interpretability. Many studies on the detection of DR with both supervised and unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) methodologies are available. Surprisingly, none of the reviews presented thus far have highlighted the potential benefits of both supervised and unsupervised DL methods in Medical Imaging for the detection of DR. After a rigorous selection process, 103 articles were retrieved from four diverse and well-known databases (Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE). This review provides a comprehensive summary of both supervised and unsupervised DL methods applied in DR detection, explaining the significant benefits of both techniques and covering aspects such as datasets, pre-processing, segmentation techniques, and supervised and unsupervised DL methods for detection. The insights from this review will aid academics and researchers in medical imaging to make informed decisions and choose the best practices for DR detection.

This survey paper explores the current state of vision-based CAD techniques for the detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy, a diabetes-induced eye disorder that can lead to severe visual impairment or blindness. Characterized by a variety of manifestations including microaneurysms, exudates, hemorrhages, and macular detachment, diabetic retinopathy presents substantial challenges for automated detection. This is primarily due to the heterogeneity of retinal fundus images, which display diverse spatiotextural features and intricate vascular structures. Our exhaustive review indicates that most existing methodologies predominantly concentrate on isolated diabetic retinopathy types, employing localized spatiotextural feature analysis for classification. Such specificity often results in limited accuracy and generalizability, restricting practical real-world application. Furthermore, contemporary leading methods generally focus on single retinal characteristics, necessitating patients to undergo multiple CAD procedures, thereby increasing time, costs, and possibly intensifying retinal complexities. To overcome these obstacles, we propose the adoption of multi-trait-driven CAD solutions. Utilizing the potent capabilities of deep learning, these solutions could employ high-dimensional, multi-cue sensitive feature extraction and ensemble learning for classification. This approach is designed to improve the generalizability and dependability of CAD systems, offering a holistic solution capable of effectively managing the diverse manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. Our study highlights the need for a fundamental transformation in diabetic retinopathy CAD systems, motivating further research towards robust, multi-modal methods to enhance detection, classification, and grading of this widespread ailment.

The existing diagnostic paradigm for diabetic retinopathy (DR) greatly relies on subjective assessments by medical practitioners utilizing optical imaging, introducing susceptibility to individual interpretation. This work presents a novel system for the early detection and grading of DR, providing an automated alternative to the manual examination.


APPROACH
First, we use advanced image preprocessing techniques, specifically contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Gaussian filtering, with the goal of enhancing image quality and module learning capabilities. Second, a deep learning-based automatic detection system is developed. The system consists of a feature segmentation module, a deep learning feature extraction module, and an ensemble classification module. The feature segmentation module accomplishes vascular segmentation, the deep learning feature extraction module realizes the global feature and local feature extraction of retinopathy images, and the ensemble module performs the diagnosis and classification of DR for the extracted features. Lastly, nine performance evaluation metrics are applied to assess the quality of the model's performance.


MAIN RESULTS
Extensive experiments are conducted on four retinal image databases (APTOS 2019, Messidor, DDR, and EyePACS). The proposed method demonstrates promising performance in the binary and multi-classification tasks for DR, evaluated through nine indicators, including AUC and quadratic weighted Kappa score. The system shows the best performance in the comparison of three segmentation methods, two convolutional neural network architecture models, four Swin Transformer structures, and the latest literature methods.


SIGNIFICANCE

Diagnosis of DR is complex due to the prevalence of inter-class differences and small lesions, making it difficult for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify discriminative regions effectively. The most critical challenge is locating complex patterns connected with visual differences and lesion locations. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this work presents a novel multi-resolution convolutional attention network (MuR-CAN), which improves overall performance by emphasizing discriminative features. MuR-CAN includes a multi-dilation attention block (MDAB), which uses depth-wise convolution layers with various dilation rates to allow the model to prioritize relevant features and capture multi-scale spatial information. This method provides for simultaneously highlighting fine features and subtle visual patterns. Furthermore, the features extracted from the MuR-CAN are utilized to train the support vector machine (SVM) for DR classification.

To be concrete, we devised sASPP combining randomness with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to accommodate the various scales of the lesions and struggle against the co-adaptation of multiple atrous convolutions. Then, GAM was introduced to extract class-agnostic global attention feature details, whilst CAM was explored for seeking class-specific distinctive region-level lesion feature information and regarding each DR severity grade in an equal way, which tackled the problem of imbalance DR data distributions. Further, the LCM was designed to automatically and adaptively search the optimal connections among layers for better extracting detailed small lesion feature representations. The proposed approach obtained high accuracy of 88.0% and kappa score of 88.6% for multi-class DR grading task on the EyePACS dataset, respectively, while 98.5% AUC, 93.8% accuracy, 87.9% kappa, 90.7% recall, 94.6% precision, and 92.6% F1-score for referral and non-referral classification on the Messidor dataset. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved competitive performance in DR grading and lesion discovery using retinal fundus images compared with existing cutting-edge methods, and had good generalization capacity for unseen DR datasets. These promising results highlighted its potential as an efficient and reliable tool to assist ophthalmologists in large-scale DR screening.","Wang et al. as discussed by the authors constructed a simple yet effective deep attentive convolutional neural network (DACNN) for fine-grained diabetic retinopathy grading and lesion discovery with only image-wise supervision."

At present, intelligent grading based on deep learning has become a hotspot in DR intelligent diagnosis.

However, the manual analysis of fundus images is time consuming and DR screening programs are challenged by the availability of human graders. Current automatic approaches for DR grading attempt the joint detection of all signs at the same time. However, the classification can be optimized if red lesions and bright lesions are independently processed since the task gets divided and simplified. Furthermore, clinicians would greatly benefit from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to support the automatic model predictions, especially when the type of lesion is specified. As a novelty, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for automatic DR grading (5 severity degrees) based on separating the attention of the dark structures from the bright structures of the retina. As the main contribution, this approach allowed us to generate independent interpretable attention maps for red lesions, such as microaneurysms and hemorrhages, and bright lesions, such as hard exudates, while using image-level labels only.Our approach is based on a novel attention mechanism which focuses separately on the dark and the bright structures of the retina by performing a previous image decomposition. This mechanism can be seen as a XAI approach which generates independent attention maps for red lesions and bright lesions. The framework includes an image quality assessment stage and deep learning-related techniques, such as data augmentation, transfer learning and fine-tuning. We used the architecture Xception as a feature extractor and the focal loss function to deal with data imbalance.The Kaggle DR detection dataset was used for method development and validation. The proposed approach achieved 83.7 % accuracy and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.78 to classify DR among 5 severity degrees, which outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches. Nevertheless, the main result of this work is the generated attention maps, which reveal the pathological regions on the image distinguishing the red lesions and the bright lesions. These maps provide explainability to the model predictions.Our results suggest that our framework is effective to automatically grade DR. The separate attention approach has proven useful for optimizing the classification. On top of that, the obtained attention maps facilitate visual interpretation for clinicians. Therefore, the proposed method could be a diagnostic aid for the early detection and grading of DR.

This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques.

Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing.

In recent years, deep learning(DL)-based methods have been recognized as promising strategies for automatic retinal blood vessel segmentation that aids in early treatment, but most earlier DL algorithms prioritized accuracy over the complexity of the model for segmenting retinal vessels, making them challenging to adapt to medical devices.

However, the classification task is challenging due to imbalanced datasets, small lesions, and inter-class similarity. This study proposes a novel deep integrative approach for DR classification, leveraging the strengths of residual blocks, channel-spatial attention mechanism (CSAM), and non-local blocks (NLB). The proposed architecture consists of a sequence of residual blocks followed by CSAM modules, which enhance feature discriminability at different scales in DR images. Additionally, the outputs from CSAM blocks are fed into an NLB to capture long-range dependencies, allowing the model to consider global context information. The proposed architecture primarily utilizes the strength of global features extracted from non-local blocks and fuses them to enrich the information representation.

Automatic DR grading with deep learning can help ophthalmologists treat patients in a timely manner. However, it is difficult to accurately grade DR because fundus images contain several different DR-related lesions such as soft exudates (SEs), hemorrhages (HEs), microaneurysms (MAs), and hard exudates (EXs), which are largely different in shape, appearance, and spatial location, and there exists strong multilesion dependency that can greatly affect the final grading results. In this article, a cross-lesion attention network (CLANet) is proposed, which can adaptively learn rich and discriminative imaging features from complicated lesions and model the dependencies of DR-related lesions. It consists of two main parts as follows. First, an adaptive lesion-aware (ALA) module based on adaptive channel-spatial convolution (ACSConv) can dynamically adjust convolution filters with different receptive fields to learn imaging features according to different DR lesions, so as to more flexibly and robustly handle the diversity of DR lesion features. Then, a cross-scale context attention (CSCA) module is developed to explore the dependencies of multiple DR-related lesions by sufficiently taking advantage of the long-range dependence learning ability of context network, which is further aggregated to learn multiscale context features in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experimental results on the public DR grading datasets [i.e., IDRiD, Messidor, and dataset for DR (DDR)] show that the proposed CLANet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","A cross-lesion attention network (CLANet) is proposed, which can adaptively learn rich and discriminative imaging features from complicated lesions and model the dependencies of DR-related lesions."

This work proposes a novel method for automatically segmenting the blood vessels and classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using fundus images. This system helps ophthalmologists with the early detection and grading of DR diseases. The main aim here is to detect any pathological changes happening in the retinal vascular structure for the development of DR, through which the patients can avoid undergoing expensive scans. The proposed system involves three different stages, including pre-processing, vessel segmentation, and classification. The input images are processed first to eliminate the noise, followed by green channel extraction and enhancement with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and gamma correction. Retinal Vascular Structure (RVS) segmentation is a major concern in this work as it is responsible for detecting the different stages of DR by detecting the presence of microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and exudates. The U-Net is used as a base architecture to develop the segmentation model. The contracting path in the U-Net contains four consecutive downsampling and upsampling layers with skip connections. After performing downsampling four times, information on the tiny blood vessels may be missed. Therefore, ResEAD2Net is introduced in this work, where the number of downsampling and upsampling layers is reduced to two instead of four, and two such contracting paths and expansion paths are added to the network. Thus, detailed semantic information can be retained with this structure. Residual blocks are included instead of convolution blocks to increase the computational speed. To include structural connectivity, the segmented output is passed through the proposed Regularized Random Walker (RRW) algorithm, which focuses on the broken blood vessels. Finally, the features are extracted from the vessel structure and passed through the Machine Learning (ML) classifier to predict the DR grading.

Early retinal screening can avoid the severe consequences of DR and enable timely treatment. Nowadays, researchers are trying to develop automated deep learning-based DR segmentation tools using retinal fundus images to help Ophthalmologists with DR screening and early diagnosis. However, recent studies are unable to design accurate models due to the unavailability of larger training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised multitask learning approach that exploits widely available unlabelled data (i.e., Kaggle-EyePACS) to improve DR segmentation performance. The proposed model consists of novel multi-decoder architecture and involves both unsupervised and supervised learning phases. The model is trained for the unsupervised auxiliary task to effectively learn from additional unlabelled data and improve the performance of the primary task of DR segmentation. The proposed technique is rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets (i.e., FGADR and IDRiD) and results show that the proposed technique not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques but also exhibits improved generalisation and robustness for cross-data evaluation.

Notably, the detection of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) has been significantly fortified through automated techniques. Traditionally, the reliance on manual analysis of retinal images, albeit slow and error-prone, constituted the conventional approach. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel methodology that amplifies the robustness and precision of the detection process. This is complemented by the groundbreaking Hierarchical Block Attention (HBA) and HBA-U-Net architecture, which notably propel attention mechanisms in image segmentation. This innovative model refines image processing without imposing excessive computational demands by honing in on individual pixel intricacies, spatial relationships, and channel-specific attention. Building upon this innovation, our proposed method employs a multi-stage strategy encompassing data pre-processing, feature extraction via a hybrid CNN-SVD model, and classification employing an amalgamation of Improved Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function (ISVM-RBF), DT, and KNN techniques. Rigorously tested on the IDRiD dataset classified into five severity tiers, the hybrid model yields remarkable performance, achieving a 99.18% accuracy, 98.15% sensitivity, and 100% specificity in VTDR detection, thus surpassing existing methods. These results underscore a more potent avenue for diagnosing and addressing this crucial ocular condition while underscoring AI’s transformative potential in medical care, particularly in ophthalmology.","This study introduces a novel methodology that amplifies the robustness and precision of the detection process of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy through an amalgamation of Improved Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function, DT, and KNN techniques."

Detection of DR presence and its complications using fundus images at an early stage helps prevent its progression to the advanced levels. In the recent years, several well-designed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proposed to detect the presence of DR with the help of publicly available datasets. However, these existing CNN-based classifiers focus on utilizing different architectural settings to improve the performance of detection task only i.e. presence or absence of DR. The further classification of the severity and type of the disease, however, remains a non-trivial task. To this end, we propose a multi-stream ensemble deep network to classify diabetic retinopathy severity. The proposed approach takes advantages of the deep networks and principal component analysis (PCA) to learn inter-class and intra-class variations from the raw image features. Ensemble machine learning classifiers are then applied to achieve high classification accuracy and robust performance on the obtained deep features. Specifically, a multi-stream network is made using pre-trained deep learning architectures i.e. ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 to serve as the main feature extractors. Further application of PCA reduces the dimensionality of features and effectively separates the variation space of inter-class and intra-class images. Finally, an ensemble machine learning classifier using AdaBoost and random forest algorithms is built to further improve classification accuracy. The proposed approach has been compared with multiple conventional CNN-based approaches on Messidor-2 (two categories) and EyePACS (two, five categories) datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves superior performance (upto 95.58% accuracy) and can be considered a promising method for automatic diabetic retinopathy detection.","In this paper , a multi-stream ensemble deep network was proposed to classify diabetic retinopathy severity, which takes advantage of the deep networks and principal component analysis to learn inter-class and intra-class variations from the raw image features."

Screening to detect early sight-threatening lesions of DR can reduce the burden of vision loss; nevertheless, the process requires intensive manual labor and extensive resources to accommodate the increasing number of patients with diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be an effective tool which can potentially lower the burden of screening DR and vision loss. In this article, we review the use of AI for DR screening on color retinal photographs in different phases of application, ranging from development to deployment. Early studies of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms using feature extraction to detect DR achieved a high sensitivity but relatively lower specificity. Robust sensitivity and specificity were achieved with the application of deep learning (DL), although ML is still used in some tasks. Public datasets were utilized in retrospective validations of the developmental phases in most algorithms, which require a large number of photographs. Large prospective clinical validation studies led to the approval of DL for autonomous screening of DR although the semi-autonomous approach may be preferable in some real-world settings. There have been few reports on real-world implementations of DL for DR screening. It is possible that AI may improve some real-world indicators for eye care in DR, such as increased screening uptake and referral adherence, but this has not been proven. The challenges in deployment may include workflow issues, such as mydriasis to lower ungradable cases; technical issues, such as integration into electronic health record systems and integration into existing camera systems; ethical issues, such as data privacy and security; acceptance of personnel and patients; and health-economic issues, such as the need to conduct health economic evaluations of using AI in the context of the country. The deployment of AI for DR screening should follow the governance model for AI in healthcare which outlines four main components: fairness, transparency, trustworthiness, and accountability.

Early and accurate diagnosis can improve the analysis and prognosis of the disease. One of the earliest symptoms of DR are the hemorrhages in the retina. Therefore, we propose a new method for accurate hemorrhage detection from the retinal fundus images. First, the proposed method uses the modified contrast enhancement method to improve the edge details from the input retinal fundus images. In the second stage, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed to detect hemorrhages. A modified pre-trained CNN model is used to extract features from the detected hemorrhages. In the third stage, all extracted feature vectors are fused using the convolutional sparse image decomposition method, and finally, the best features are selected by using the multi-logistic regression controlled entropy variance approach. The proposed method is evaluated on 1509 images from HRF, DRIVE, STARE, MESSIDOR, DIARETDB0, and DIARETDB1 databases and achieves the average accuracy of 97.71%, which is superior to the previous works. Moreover, the proposed hemorrhage detection system attains better performance, in terms of visual quality and quantitative analysis with high accuracy, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.","Wang et al. as mentioned in this paper proposed a new method for accurate hemorrhage detection from the retinal fundus images, which uses the modified contrast enhancement method to improve the edge details from the input retinal fundsus images."

However, automated, complete DR classification frameworks based on both OCT and OCTA data have not been proposed. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based method is proposed to fulfill a DR classification framework using en face OCT and OCTA. Methods: A densely and continuously connected neural network with adaptive rate dropout ( DcardNet ) is designed for the DR classification. In addition, adaptive label smoothing was proposed and used to suppress overfitting. Three separate classification levels are generated for each case based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale. At the highest level the network classifies scans as referable or non-referable for DR. The second level classifies the eye as non-DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), or proliferative DR (PDR). The last level classifies the case as no DR, mild and moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and PDR. Results: We used 10-fold cross-validation with 10% of the data to assess the network's performance. The overall classification accuracies of the three levels were 95.7%, 85.0%, and 71.0% respectively.

Low-shot learning algorithms, aiming to learn from a relatively low number of training data, may be beneficial for clinical situations involving rare retinal diseases or when addressing potential bias resulting from data that may not adequately represent certain groups for training, such as individuals older than 85 years. Objective To evaluate whether low-shot deep learning methods are beneficial when using small training data sets for automated retinal diagnostics. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study, conducted from July 1, 2019, to June 21, 2020, compared different diabetic retinopathy classification algorithms, traditional and low-shot, for 2-class designations (diabetic retinopathy warranting referral vs not warranting referral). The public domain EyePACS data set was used, which originally included 88 692 fundi from 44 346 individuals. Statistical analysis was performed from February 1 to June 21, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The performance (95% CIs) of the various AI algorithms was measured via receiver operating curves and their area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, accuracy, and F1 score, evaluated for different training data sizes, ranging from 5120 to 10 samples per class. Results Deep learning algorithms, when trained with sufficiently large data sets (5120 samples per class), yielded comparable performance, with an AUC of 0.8330 (95% CI, 0.8140-0.8520) for a traditional approach (eg, fined-tuned ResNet), compared with low-shot methods (AUC, 0.8348 [95% CI, 0.8159-0.8537]) (using self-supervised Deep InfoMax [our method denoted as DIM]). However, when far fewer training images were available (n = 160), the traditional deep learning approach had an AUC decreasing to 0.6585 (95% CI, 0.6332-0.6838) and was outperformed by a low-shot method using self-supervision with an AUC of 0.7467 (95% CI, 0.7239-0.7695). At very low shots (n = 10), the traditional approach had performance close to chance, with an AUC of 0.5178 (95% CI, 0.4909-0.5447) compared with the best low-shot method (AUC, 0.5778 [95% CI, 0.5512-0.6044]).

Simultaneous prediction of DR related features during the DR severity diagnosis is able to resolve this issue by providing supporting evidence (i.e. DR related features) for the diagnostic result (i.e. DR severity). In this study, we propose a hierarchical multi-task deep learning framework for simultaneous diagnosis of DR severity and DR related features in fundus images. A hierarchical structure is introduced to incorporate the casual relationship between DR related features and DR severity levels. In the experiments, the proposed approach was evaluated on two independent testing sets using quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and precision-recall analysis. A grader study was also conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach with those of general ophthalmologists with different levels of experience. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach could improve the performance for both DR severity diagnosis and DR related feature detection when comparing with the traditional deep learning-based methods.

Diabetic Retinopathy is regarded as the leading cause of blindness for diabetic patients, especially the working-age population in developing nations. Treatment involves sustaining the patient’s current grade of vision since the disease is irreversible. Early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy is crucial in order to sustain the patient’s vision effectively. The main issue involved with DR detection is that the manual diagnosis process is very time, money and effort consuming, and involves an ophthalmologist’s examination of eye retinal fundus images. The latter also proves to be more difficult, particularly in the early stages of the disease when disease features are less prominent in the images. Machine learning-based medical image analysis has proven competency in assessing retinal fundus images and the utilization of deep learning algorithms has aided the early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). This paper reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art deep learning methods in supervised, self-supervised, Vision Transformer etc. setups, proposing retinal fundus image classification and detection. For instance, referable, non-referable, and proliferative classification of Diabetic Retinopathy are reviewed and summarized.

Hence, it has become a dangerous threat to the health and life of people. To overcome DR, manual diagnosis of the disease is feasible but overwhelming and cumbersome at the same time and hence requires a revolutionary method.

The RFIA screening programs help the ophthalmologists to cope with this paramount visual impairment problem. In this article, an automatic recognition of the DR stage is proposed based on a new multi-layer architecture of active deep learning (ADL). To develop the ADL system, we used the convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to automatically extract features compare to handcrafted-based features. However, the training of CNN procedure requires an immense size of labeled data that makes it almost difficult in the classification phase. As a result, a label-efficient CNN architecture is presented known as ADL-CNN by using one of the active learning methods known as an expected gradient length (EGL). This ADL-CNN model can be seen as a two-stage process. At first, the proposed ADL-CNN system selects both the most informative patches and images by using some ground truth labels of training samples to learn the simple to complex retinal features. Next, it provides useful masks for prognostication to assist clinical specialists for the important eye sample annotation and segment regions-of-interest within the retinograph image to grade five severity-levels of diabetic retinopathy. To test and evaluate the performance of ADL-CNN model, the EyePACS benchmark is utilized and compared with state-of-the-art methods.

On 54,000 retinograph images, the ADL-CNN model achieved an average SE of 92.20%, SP of 95.10%, F-measure of 93% and ACC of 98%.

It has been observed that the eye fundus images show various kinds of color aberrations and irrelevant illuminations, which degrade the diagnostic analysis and may hinder the results. In this research, we present a methodology to eliminate these unnecessary reflectance properties of the images using a novel image processing schema and a stacked deep learning technique for the diagnosis. For the luminosity normalization of the image, the gray world color constancy algorithm is implemented which does image desaturation and improves the overall image quality. The effectiveness of the proposed image enhancement technique is evaluated based on the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the normalized image. To develop a deep learning based computer-aided diagnostic system, we present a novel methodology of stacked generalization of convolution neural networks (CNN). Three custom CNN model weights are fed on the top of a single meta-learner classifier, which combines the most optimum weights of the three sub-neural networks to obtain superior metrics of evaluation and robust prediction results. The proposed stacked model reports an overall test accuracy of 97.92% (binary classification) and 87.45% (multi-class classification). Extensive experimental results in terms of accuracy, F-measure, sensitivity, specificity, recall and precision reveal that the proposed methodology of illumination normalization greatly facilitated the deep learning model and yields better results than various state-of-art techniques.","In this article, the authors proposed a methodology to eliminate unnecessary reflectance properties of the images using a novel image processing schema and a stacked deep learning technique for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy."

In this article, we propose a composite deep neural network architecture with gated-attention mechanism for automated diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The feature descriptors obtained from multiple pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to represent color fundus retinal images. Spatial pooling methods are introduced to get the reduced versions of these representations without loosing much information.

In addition, model also includes gated attention blocks which allows the model to emphasize more on lesion portions of the retinal images while reduced attention to the non-lesion regions. Our experiments on APTOS-2019 Kaggle blindness detection challenge reveal that, the proposed approach leads to improved performance when compared to the existing best models.

Diabetic Retinopathy is regarded as the leading cause of blindness for diabetic patients, especially the working-age population in developing nations. Treatment involves sustaining the patient’s current grade of vision since the disease is irreversible. Early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy is crucial in order to sustain the patient’s vision effectively. The main issue involved with DR detection is that the manual diagnosis process is very time, money, and effort consuming and involves an ophthalmologist’s examination of eye retinal fundus images. The latter also proves to be more difficult, particularly in the early stages of the disease when disease features are less prominent in the images. Machine learning-based medical image analysis has proven competency in assessing retinal fundus images, and the utilization of deep learning algorithms has aided the early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). This paper reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art deep learning methods in supervised, self-supervised, and Vision Transformer setups, proposing retinal fundus image classification and detection. For instance, referable, non-referable, and proliferative classifications of Diabetic Retinopathy are reviewed and summarized. Moreover, the paper discusses the available retinal fundus datasets for Diabetic Retinopathy that are used for tasks such as detection, classification, and segmentation.

We further explore the relationship between the number of ideal component classifiers and the number of class labels, as well as the effects of different combinations of component classifiers on the best integration performance to construct an optimal model. We evaluate the models on the basis of validity and reliability using nine metrics. Results show that the identification model performs best with a sensitivity of 97.5%, a specificity of 97.7% and an area under the curve of 97.7%.

Automatic grading of DR and DME helps ophthalmologists design tailored treatments to patients, thus is of vital importance in the clinical practice. However, prior works either grade DR or DME, and ignore the correlation between DR and its complication, i.e ., DME. Moreover, the location information, e.g ., macula and soft hard exhaust annotations, are widely used as a prior for grading. Such annotations are costly to obtain, hence it is desirable to develop automatic grading methods with only image-level supervision. In this article, we present a novel cross-disease attention network (CANet) to jointly grade DR and DME by exploring the internal relationship between the diseases with only image-level supervision. Our key contributions include the disease-specific attention module to selectively learn useful features for individual diseases, and the disease-dependent attention module to further capture the internal relationship between the two diseases. We integrate these two attention modules in a deep network to produce disease-specific and disease-dependent features, and to maximize the overall performance jointly for grading DR and DME. We evaluate our network on two public benchmark datasets, i.e ., ISBI 2018 IDRiD challenge dataset and Messidor dataset.

Early detection and accurate grading are essential to prevent vision loss. Current automatic grading methods rely heavily on deep learning applied to retinal fundus images, but the complex, irregular patterns of lesions in these images, which vary in shape and distribution, make it difficult to capture the subtle changes. This study introduces RadFuse, a multi-representation deep learning framework that integrates non-linear RadEx-transformed sinogram images with traditional fundus images to enhance diabetic retinopathy detection and grading. Our RadEx transformation, an optimized non-linear extension of the Radon transform, generates sinogram representations to capture complex retinal lesion patterns. By leveraging both spatial and transformed domain information, RadFuse enriches the feature set available to deep learning models, improving the differentiation of severity levels. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, APTOS-2019 and DDR, using three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): ResNeXt-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG19. RadFuse showed significant improvements over fundus-image-only models across all three CNN architectures and outperformed state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. For severity grading across five stages, RadFuse achieved a quadratic weighted kappa of 93.24%, an accuracy of 87.07%, and an F1-score of 87.17%. In binary classification between healthy and diabetic retinopathy cases, the method reached an accuracy of 99.09%, precision of 98.58%, and recall of 99.64%, surpassing previously established models. These results demonstrate RadFuse's capacity to capture complex non-linear features, advancing diabetic retinopathy classification and promoting the integration of advanced mathematical transforms in medical image analysis.

Addressing the pressing need for scalable, objective, and interpretable diagnostic tools, this work introduces RetinoDeep—deep learning frameworks integrating hybrid architectures and explainable AI to enhance the automated detection and classification of DR across seven severity levels. Specifically, we propose four novel models: an EfficientNetB0 combined with an SPCL transformer for robust global feature extraction; a ResNet50 ensembled with Bi-LSTM to synergize spatial and sequential learning; a Bi-LSTM optimized through genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning; and a Bi-LSTM with SHAP explainability to enhance model transparency and clinical trustworthiness. The models were trained and evaluated on a curated dataset of 757 retinal fundus images, augmented to improve generalization, and benchmarked against state-of-the-art baselines (including EfficientNetB0, Hybrid Bi-LSTM with EfficientNetB0, Hybrid Bi-GRU with EfficientNetB0, ResNet with filter enhancements, Bi-LSTM optimized using Random Search Algorithm (RSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)), using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and precision.

To address the dual limitations of existing methods in multi-scale lesions feature fusion and lesions relation modeling, this study proposes a novel adaptive multi-scale convolutional neural network model for fine-grained grading of DR, called MAFNet (Multi-scale Adaptive Fine-grained Network). The model is constructed through three core modules to establish a multi-scale feature integration framework: the Hierarchical Global Context Module (HGCM) effectively expands the receptive field by employing multi-scale pooling and dynamic feature fusion, capturing lesions features from micro to large-scale areas; the Multi-scale Adaptive Attention Module (MSAM) utilizes an adaptive attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the feature weights at different spatial locations, enhancing the representation of key lesions regions; and the Relational Multi-head Attention Module (RMA) uses a multi-head attention mechanism to model the complex relationships between features in parallel, improving the accuracy of fine-grained lesions identification. Furthermore, MAFNet adopts a multi-task learning framework, transforming the DR grading task into a dual-task structure of regression and classification, thereby effectively capturing the progression of DR. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, DDR, Messidor-2, and APTOS, show that the quadratic weighted Kappa values of the MAFNet model reach 0.934, 0.917, and 0.936, respectively, significantly outperforming existing DR grading methods such as LANet and MPLNet, demonstrating its significant application value in automated DR grading.

In this paper, we present Fused-AETNet (Fused AutoEncoder–Transformer Network), a novel deep-learning framework that uniquely combines clinically interpretable handcrafted OCT biomarkers with a robust variational autoencoder and a transformer-based classifier. Unlike prior OCT–DR approaches that directly utilize raw intensities or generic CNN-derived features, our method begins with precise segmentation of eleven retinal layers in the central OCT B-scan using an atlas-guided probabilistic approach. From each layer, we extract three clinically validated morphological descriptors—reflectivity, Laplacian-based thickness, and boundary tortuosity—and summarize them through percentile-based Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) to capture regional variability in a compact, size-invariant form. These descriptors are fused into a smooth latent embedding via variational autoencoding, enabling robust modelling of cross-layer dependencies and uncertainty. The latent space is then refined using a lightweight transformer-inspired attention module that selectively amplifies diagnostically relevant embeddings while suppressing irrelevant variations. This biomarker-driven design enhances both the specificity and interpretability of the diagnostic decision process. Our training employs a composite loss function that jointly enforces accurate descriptor reconstruction, latent space regularization, and high classification accuracy.

This underscores the urgent need for cost-effective and reliable screening methods. Consequently, the integration of Artificial Intelligence tools presents a promising avenue to address this need effectively. We provide an overview of the current state of the art results and techniques in DR screening using AI, while also identifying gaps in research for future exploration. By synthesizing existing database and pinpointing areas requiring further investigation, this paper seeks to guide the direction of future research in the field of automatic diabetic retinopathy screening. There has been a continuous rise in the number of articles detailing Deep Learning methods designed for the automatic screening of Diabetic Retinopathy especially by the year 2021. Researchers utilized various databases, with a primary focus on the IDRiD dataset. This dataset comprises color fundus images captured at an ophthalmological clinic situated in India. It comprises 516 images that depict various stages of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Each of the chosen papers concentrates on various DR signs. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the authors primarily focused on detecting exudates, which remains insufficient to assess the overall presence of this disease. Various AI methods have been employed to identify DR signs. Among the chosen papers, 4.7% utilized detection methods, 46.5% employed classification techniques, 41.9% relied on segmentation, and 7% opted for a combination of classification and segmentation. Metrics calculated from 80% of the articles employing preprocessing techniques demonstrated the significant benefits of this approach in enhancing results quality. In addition, multiple Deep Learning techniques, starting by classification, detection then segmentation. Researchers used mostly YOLO for detection, ViT for classification and U-Net for segmentation. Another perspective on the evolving landscape of AI models for diabetic retinopathy screening lies in the increasing adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks for classification tasks and U-Net architectures for segmentation purposes;However, there is a growing realization within the research community that these techniques, while powerful individually, can be even more effective when integrated. This integration holds promise for not only diagnosing DR but also accurately classifying its different stages, thereby enabling more tailored treatment strategies. Despite this potential, the development of AI models for DR screening is fraught with challenges. Chief among these is the difficulty in obtaining high-quality, labeled data necessary for training models to perform effectively. This scarcity of data poses significant barriers to achieving robust performance and can hinder progress in developing accurate screening systems. Moreover, managing the complexity of these models, particularly deep neural networks, presents its own set of challenges. Additionally, interpreting the outputs of these models and ensuring their reliability in real-world clinical settings remain ongoing concerns. Furthermore, the iterative process of training and adapting these models to specific datasets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. These challenges underscore the multifaceted nature of developing effective AI models for DR screening. Addressing these obstacles requires concerted efforts from researchers, clinicians, and technologists to innovate new approaches and overcome existing limitations. By doing so, a full potential of AI may transform DR screening and improve patient outcomes. ","Diabetic retinopathy screening through AI algorithms is a promising field with the potential to improve patient outcomes.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays an important role in clinical diagnosis. However, automatic grading of DR is challenging due to the presence of intra-class variation and small lesions. On the one hand, deep features learned by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often lose valid information about these small lesions. On the other hand, the great variability of lesion features, including differences in type and quantity, can exhibit considerable divergences even among fundus images of the same grade. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-scale Multi-attention Network (MMNet).


APPROACH
Firstly, to focus on different lesion features of fundus images, we propose a Lesion Attention Module (LAM), which aims to encode multiple different lesion attention feature maps by combining channel attention and spatial attention, thus extracting global feature information and preserving diverse lesion features. Secondly, we propose a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (MFFM) to learn more feature information for small lesion regions, which combines complementary relationships between different convolutional layers to capture more detailed feature information. Furthermore, we introduce a Cross-layer Consistency Constraint Loss to overcome semantic differences between multi-scale features.


MAIN RESULTS
The proposed MMNet obtains a high accuracy of 86.4% and a high kappa score of 88.4% for multi-class DR grading tasks on the EyePACS dataset, while 98.6% AUC, 95.3% accuracy, 92.7% recall, 95.0% precision, and 93.3% F1-score for referral and non-referral classification on the Messidor-1 dataset. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our MMNet achieves significant improvements and outperforms other state-of-the-art DR grading methods.

It is a fatal eye disease damaging the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue in the rear of the eye. Ophthalmologists use fundus images to capture retinal inner structures to find broken blood vessels and scars. To detect DR on time, early diagnosis is very important which is often not possible due to complex procedures. Therefore, automation of DR detection can solve this problem. Accessibility to regular examinations and specialized eye care remains a challenge, especially in underserved areas, due to late diagnosis, a lack of healthcare infrastructure, and other factors. Although automated detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images has shown promising results, challenges arise to accomplish high accuracy, particularly in hidden or early-stage DR situations. One of the major limitations in developing a detection model is the lack of imaging datasets as it requires a large number of images to train the model more accurately. Deep transfer learning-based models have shown promising results especially when datasets are not very large.

Automatic DR grading plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and intervention, reducing the risk of vision loss in people with diabetes. In these years, various deep-learning approaches for DR grading have been proposed. Most previous DR grading models are trained using the dataset of single-field fundus images, but the entire retina cannot be fully visualized in a single field of view. There are also problems of scattered location and great differences in the appearance of lesions in fundus images.

Furthermore, the proposed model combines multi-view inputs such as fundus images and lesion snapshots. It utilizes heterogeneous convolution blocks (HCB) and scalable self-attention classes (SSAC), which enhance the ability of the model to obtain lesion information. The experimental results show that our proposed method performs better than the benchmark methods on the large-scale dataset.","This work introduces a novel multi-view DR grading framework, which solves the problem of incomplete fundus features by jointly learning fundus images from multiple fields of view by jointly learning fundus images from multiple fields of view."

If not detected and diagnosed in time, it may result in visual impairment. With the development of deep learning, various automatic diagnosis models for DR have been proposed. Most models are based on convolutional neural networks, but due to the small size of convolution kernels in shallow networks, the receptive field is limited, preventing the capture of global information. This limitation forces models to require more convolutional layers to expand the receptive field and capture global information related to DR. In this paper, we use a combined module of multiscale convolution and convolutional self-attention, and we adjust the module structure, allowing the model to have both long-range dependency modeling capability and CNN’s multiscale local feature extraction capability, while having fewer model parameters than the selected comparison models. Our proposed MSAmix-Net achieved an accuracy of 82.3% in the five-class classification task on the combined dataset of APTOS-2019 and Messidor-2, and an accuracy of 93.9% in the three-class classification task on the DRAC-2022 dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the model can effectively capture and represent the complex features of diabetic retinopathy.","This paper proposes MSAmix-Net, a deep learning model combining multiscale convolution and self-attention for diabetic retinopathy classification, achieving 82.3% accuracy on a combined dataset and 93.9% on DRAC-2022, outperforming comparison models with fewer parameters."

Akhloufi","10.3390/biomedicines13010141","","Background: Retinal blood vessel segmentation plays an important role in diagnosing retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertensive retinopathy. Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images presents a challenging task due to noise, low contrast, and the complex morphology of blood vessel structures. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel ensemble learning framework combining four deep learning architectures: U-Net, ResNet50, U-Net with a ResNet50 backbone, and U-Net with a transformer block. Each architecture is customized to enhance feature extraction and segmentation performance. The models are trained on the DRIVE and STARE datasets to improve the degree of generalization and evaluated using the performance metric accuracy, F1-Score, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.
