","effectiveness in accurately identifying individuals at risk for diabetes. Comparison with state-of-the-art: However, further research may be needed to examine the impact of data balancing methods on the performance of our model and to ensure detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Comparison with state-of-the-art:
 Our proposed hybrid machine learning algorithm achieved better results compared to the models discussed by Qin et al.  for several reasons. Firstly, our model integrates SVM, decision tree, and random forest classifiers, providing a more comprehensive representation of underlying patterns in the data. Comparison with state-of-the-art:
 Secondly, the inclusion of a diverse set of features, including traditional clinical factors and external factors, allows our model to capture a wider range of factors influencing diabetes risk. Comparison with state-of-the-art:
 Thirdly, leveraging ensemble learning techniques, our hybrid model effectively combines the predictions of multiple classifiers, reducing bias and variance and improving overall predictive performance. Additionally, more robust data preprocessing techniques employed by our model, such as handling missing values and outlier detection, contribute to enhanced data quality and model performance. Comparison with state-of-the-art:
 Finally, differences in evaluation metrics or criteria may also have played a role in the reported superior performance of our model. These factors collectively contribute to the improved accuracy and reliability of our proposed hybrid machine learning algorithm in predicting diabetes risk compared to the other models. CONCLUSION:
 Diabetes prediction models are important in the field of healthcare as They can assist identify those who are at high risk of getting diabetes. By using a combination of clinical and lifestyle factors, these models can provide an accurate assessment of an individual's risk of developing diabetes. CONCLUSION:
 This information can be used by healthcare professionals to provide appropriate interventions and management strategies to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. CONCLUSION:

Algorithms that learn robust models by estimating invariant properties across time periods for domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) might be suitable to proactively mitigate dataset shift. Objective To characterize the impact of temporal dataset shift on clinical prediction models and benchmark DG and UDA algorithms on improving model robustness. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, intensive care unit patients from the MIMIC-IV database were categorized by year groups (2008–2010, 2011–2013, 2014–2016 and 2017–2019). Tasks were predicting mortality, long length of stay, sepsis and invasive ventilation. Feedforward neural networks were used as prediction models. The baseline experiment trained models using empirical risk minimization (ERM) on 2008–2010 (ERM[08-10]) and evaluated them on subsequent year groups. DG experiment trained models using algorithms that estimated invariant properties using 2008–2016 and evaluated them on 2017– 2019. UDA experiment leveraged unlabelled samples from 2017–2019 for unsupervised distribution matching. DG and UDA models were compared to ERM[08-16] models trained using 2008-2016. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Main performance measures were area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve and absolute calibration error. Threshold-based metrics including false-positives and false-negatives were used to assess the clinical impact of temporal dataset shift and its mitigation strategies. Results In the baseline experiments, dataset shift was most evident for sepsis prediction (maximum AUROC drop, 0.090; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080-0.101). Considering a scenario of 100 consecutively admitted patients showed that ERM[08-10] applied to 2017-2019 was associated with one additional false-negative among 11 patients with sepsis, when compared to the model applied to 2008-2010. When compared with ERM[08-16], DG and UDA experiments failed to produce more robust models (range of AUROC difference, −0.003-0.050). Conclusions and Relevance DG and UDA failed to produce more robust models compared to ERM in the setting of temporal dataset shift. Alternate approaches are required to preserve model performance over time in clinical medicine. KEY POINTS Question Can algorithms that estimate invariant properties across environments for domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation improve the robustness of machine learning-derived clinical prediction models to temporal dataset shift? Findings In this cohort study using 4 clinical outcomes, domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms did not meaningfully outperform the standard model training algorithm – empirical risk minimization – in learning robust models that generalize over time in the presence of temporal dataset shift. Meaning These findings highlight the difficulty of improving robustness to dataset shift with purely data-driven techniques that do not leverage prior knowledge of the nature of the shift and the requirement of alternate approaches to preserve model performance over time in clinical medicine.","Title: Evaluation of Domain Generalization and Adaptation on Improving Model Robustness to Temporal Dataset Shift in Clinical Medicine -Source link Authors: Lin Lawrence Guo,Jason A Pfohl,Alistair E W Fries,Johnson,Stephen R Pfohl,Jason Fries,Alistair Johnson,Jose Posada,Catherine Aftandilian,Nigam Shah,Lillian Sung (Corresponding Author) Keywords: dataset shift, machine learning, clinical data, mimic"

The main drivers are openly available healthcare datasets, and a general interest from the community to use its powers for knowledge discovery and technological advancements in this more conservative field. However, with this additional volume comes a range of questions and concerns — are the obtained results meaningful and conclusions accurate; how do we know we have improved state of the art; is the clinical problem well defined and does the model address it? We reflect on key aspects in the end-to-end pipeline that we believe suffer the most in this space, and suggest some good practices to avoid reproducing these issues. Finding good benchmarks is an important and pervasive problem in machine learning for healthcare. This Perspective highlights key aspects that require scrutiny in the whole process of benchmark generation and use, including problem formulation, creation of datasets, development of a suite of machine learning models and evaluation of these models. ","looking at the class imbalance and showcasing metrics based on the label skew is critical (for example reporting the area under the precision-recall curve alongside just the area under the receiver operating characteristic), as well as including clinically relevant metrics such as sensitivity and specificity . Results:
 When it comes to fairness and robustness, there are a few key issues that keep surfacing: (1) performance across subgroups differs; Results:
 (2) similarly performing models behave differently in unexpected ways when there is a shift from the training distribution. Recent work has shown that general mitigation techniques developed for some fairness issues do not translate so well when it comes to healthcare applications  . Together with ref.  , it showcases a number of stress tests that were performed during model investigation, that we argue should be performed as part of the usual benchmarking routine to bring such issues to the surface before it is too late. A popular benchmarking study on MIMIC-III 1 has recently been found to display issues when it comes to fairness and generalizability  . We therefore want to stress the importance of the community becoming more familiar with the model's performance in different contexts, and include stress tests. Future improvements could then not only target the base model performance on the training set, but also see what technique is the most resilient when faced with real-world contexts. Results:
 Aside from looking at metrics and tables, visualizations can also help investigate the model's performance. A few suggestions would be activation atlases  , attention heatmaps  , grand tour  , integrated gradients  or concept activation vectors  . These can help identify what the model is learning and help test these techniques in different contexts, providing valuable data for future research directions. We do want to acknowledge that, in the fields of model explainability and interpretability, results can be misinterpreted  , and urge researchers to familiarize themselves with the various techniques and their failure modes to avoid misuse. Results:
 Finally, we are aware that there is always more work left to be done when finalizing a research paper. More often than not, there are lingering experiments that authors wanted to perform, but were unable to owing to various constraints. While some are listed in the limitations sections, typically these address continuations of experiments already mentioned. We believe that asking authors to further write down precise experiments that were left out can help both expand upon that work, and also spread awareness of key tests. Clinical deployment:
 While innovative ML models have been developed for healthcare, very few of them find real-world application  . Recent surveys on ML-based clinical tools have shown that well validated models, achieving good performance in the development stage, may fail to show any clinical benefit for patients when compared with routine care  . Clinical deployment:
 We acknowledge that the deployment of ML in healthcare for researchers is hard, as barriers to implementation include regulation, incentives, lack of appreciation and generalizability concerns, to name a few. In addition, prospective validation studies require time and money, which can be a big challenge. Under these circumstances, papers that go the extra mile  and show some form of validation studies should be positively distinguished."

A major concern, however, is that model performance is heavily tied to details particular to the dataset the model was developed on-even slight deviations from the training conditions can result in wildly different performance. For example, when researchers trained a model to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays using data from one health system, but evaluated on data from an external health system, they found the model performed significantly worse than it did internally . The model failed to generalize (i.e., predict accurately) due to the shifts between the training conditions (health system one) and the deployment/testing conditions (health system two). These shifts are very common when moving a model from the training phase to deployment and can take a variety of forms, including changes in patient demographics, disease prevalence, measurement timing, equipment, treatment patterns, and more. Beyond contributing to poor performance, failing to account for shifts can also lead to dangerous decisions in practice: the system can fail to diagnose severely ill patients or recommend harmful treatments. This problem of shifting conditions which prevent generalization is referred to as dataset shift , and in this article, we explain what it is, why it occurs, give an overview of the types of existing solutions, and discuss open challenges that remain. Generalization is crucial for successfully deploying models since we want model predictions to be accurate when applied to new situations that were not in the training dataset. In order to ensure that a model will generalize, a core requirement is to check that the model or learning procedure satisfies the stability property: is model performance robust when the data are perturbed in various ways? In particular, when addressing dataset shift, we want models to be stable to perturbations in (i.e., shifts in) how the data were generated-such as changes to patient demographics or clinician treatment patterns-as opposed to leave-one-out sampling perturbations  or adversarial perturbations of model inputs . Dataset shift is of particular importance because it frequently occurs when deploying models, is difficult to test stability against (as we will discuss later), and is highly relevant to the ongoing discussion about the challenges of regulating ML-driven medical devices (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019) (see accompanying  for more on this)."

 Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic condition marked by high blood glucose levels, is significant in medical history, with roots tracing back to ancient civilizations. The word ""diabetes"" derives from a Greek term meaning ""siphon,"" which refers to the observation of sweet-tasting urine in people with the disease . Introduction:
 Diabetic patients were notably recorded by Apollonius of Memphis around 250 to 300 BC, who documented this peculiar symptom, marking one of the earliest accounts of diabetes . Introduction:
 Throughout the centuries, our understanding of diabetes has evolved, propelled by critical discoveries and advancements. One pivotal moment occurred in 1922 when Banting, Best, and Collip successfully isolated insulin from cow pancreas, introducing a lifesaving therapy for individuals with diabetes. Introduction:
 Despite such breakthroughs, diabetes remains a formidable global health challenge, ranking among the top causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide . Introduction:
 The landscape of diabetes encompasses various forms, each with its unique etiology, clinical presentation, and management considerations. Type 1 diabetes is defined by the autoimmune obliteration of cells that produce insulin, typically manifesting in youth but can occur at any age. Introduction:

We evaluated the impact of data shifts on an early warning system (EWS) for in-hospital mortality that uses electronic health record (EHR) data from patients admitted to a general internal medicine service. We found model performance to differ across subgroups of clinical diagnoses, sex and age. To explore the robustness of the model, we evaluated potentially harmful data shifts across demographics, hospital types, seasons, times of hospital admission, and whether the patient was admitted from an acute care institution or nursing home, without relying on model performance. Interestingly, we found that models trained on community hospitals experience harmful data shifts when evaluated on academic hospitals, whereas the models trained on academic hospitals transfer well to the community hospitals. To improve model performance across hospital sites we employed transfer learning, a strategy that stores knowledge gained from learning one domain and applies it to a different but related domain. We found hospital type-specific models that leverage transfer learning, perform better than models that use all available hospitals. Furthermore, we monitored data shifts over time and identified model deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Typically machine learning models remain locked after deployment, however, this can lead to model deterioration due to data shifts that occur over time. We used continual learning, the process of learning from a continual stream of data in a sequential manner, to mitigate data shifts over time and improve model performance. Overall, our study is a crucial step towards the deployment of clinical AI models, by providing strategies and workflows to ensure the safety and efficacy of these models in real-world settings.","to help explain the failures of fairness transfer across distribution shifts . Given the sensitivity of clinical data, it is also important that future drift detection and retraining strategies consider privacy-preserving methods to ensure institutional boundaries are respected and autonomy is maintained over patient data . Discussion:
 In this study, we developed a drift-triggered continual learning strategy to improve model performance over time. However, it is worth noting that continual learning is not without risks, including catastrophic forgetting and feedback loops  . Unfortunately, our dataset is unable to fully capture these long-term trends, but as more data is accumulated it will become possible to understand the impact of these model updating strategies over extended periods of time. Another caveat is that the current regulatory state of continual learning systems does not clearly define how and what aspects of a clinical AI system are permitted to change following authorization  . There are also several other training and updating strategies we did not explore, which can be leveraged to improve model performance in the presence of data shifts, including domain generalization (DG)  , representation learning  , meta learning  , and multi-task learning  . For instance, consideration of other relevant prediction tasks (e.g. LOS, ICU transfer)  or patient populations  for pre-training could improve model generalization. Similarly, DG methods have been used as an alternative to baseline empirical risk minimization (ERM), to mitigate data shift  . However, many DG methods have repeatedly only been shown to improve performance in the context of extreme synthetic shifts and demonstrate poor performance on real world EHR data  . Instead, alternative ERM approaches (i.e. those that use stratified training, balanced subpopulation sampling, or worst-case model selection) outperform DG methods and show promise in mitigating model bias  . Unfortunately, many studies fail to consider strong and realistic ERM baselines. Discussion:
 Clinical AI systems are complex, and each will differ in its biases and optimal retraining and updating procedures. As such, we have developed a monitoring and evaluation pipeline as part of a broader ML operations (MLOps) framework for clinical AI systems  to facilitate robust evaluation and monitoring prior to deployment. Too often clinical ML models are reported with high performance metrics, while being developed in isolation. It is important to ensure that models are designed with deployment in mind, to ensure the responsible deployment of clinical AI systems. We hope our work permits the robust evaluation and monitoring of clinical AI systems in an effort to bridge the gap between model development and deployment  ."

While machine learning (ML) approaches have been widely used to improve early detection and treatment, several studies have shown low classification accuracies due to overfitting, underfitting, and data noise. This research employs parallel and sequential ensemble ML approaches paired with feature selection techniques to boost classification accuracy. The Pima India Diabetes Data from the UCI ML Repository served as the dataset. Data preprocessing included cleaning the dataset by replacing missing values with column means and selecting highly correlated features using forward and backward selection methods. The dataset was split into two parts: training (70%), and testing (30%). Python was used for classification in Jupyter Notebook, and there were two design phases. The first phase utilized J48, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Decision Stump (DS) to create a random forest model. The second phase employed the same algorithms alongside sequential ensemble methods—XG Boost, AdaBoostM1, and Gradient Boosting—using an average voting algorithm for binary classification. Evaluation revealed that XG Boost, AdaBoostM1, and Gradient Boosting achieved classification accuracies of 100%, with performance metrics including F1 score, MCC, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC, and AUC-PR all equal to 1.00, indicating reliable predictions of diabetes presence.

Specifically, we overview the different types of algorithmic bias, fairness quantification metrics, and bias mitigation methods, and summarize popular software libraries and tools for bias evaluation and mitigation, with the goal of providing reference and insights to researchers and practitioners in computational medicine. ","Different types of fairness are sometimes incompatible. For example, a model could be fair for equal positive and negative predictive values, but unfair for equalized odds (and vice versa). It is important to understand which types of fairness are achievable under which scenarios. Algorithm explainability:
 Explainable models can reveal how a machine learning algorithm works and thus potentially alleviate decision bias. However, on the other hand, interacting with incorrect recommendations paired with explanations that contain limited but easily interpretable information can adversely affect the clinician's treatment choices  . Algorithm explainability:
 Understanding such interaction between algorithm explainability and bias is important for medical machine learning. Model generalization:
 Fairness in machine learning goes beyond preventing models from harming protected populations. It can also help focus care where it is really needed. The data used to develop the model may not be generalized to the data used during the deployment of the model (training-serving skew)  . Thus, besides model design and evaluation, fairness should also be incorporated into the scenario where the model is going to be deployed  . Search strategy and selection criteria:
 We searched PubMed and Google Scholar from inception of the database to Jul 30, 2021, for research articles using the search terms (""bias"" OR ""disparity"" OR ""fairness"" OR ""fair"" OR ""inequality"" OR ""equality"") AND (""machine learning"" OR ""artificial intelligence"") AND (""medical"" OR ""medicine"" OR ""healthcare"") in English.

Fairness problems have been identified in machine learning for healthcare, resulting in an unfair allocation of limited healthcare resources or excessive health risks for certain groups. Therefore, addressing the fairness problems has recently attracted increasing attention from the healthcare community. However, the intersection of machine learning for healthcare and fairness in machine learning remains understudied. In this review, we build the bridge by exposing fairness problems, summarizing possible biases, sorting out mitigation methods and pointing out challenges along with opportunities for the future. ","Q-Pain dataset for the medical QA task in the context of pain management. The authors evaluate the two models GPT-2 and GPT-3 through a newly proposed potential bias framework and find statistically significant differences in treatment decisions across gender subgroups. Other Data Types:
 In addition to the three types of data mentioned above, data such as physiological data and genomics data are used in healthcare applications. Several studies have also identified fairness issues that arise when machine learning methods are applied to these data. For example, the Vital-ECG, a wearable smart device that monitors ECG and chest X-ray signals, is embedded with machine learning methods to predict and monitor arterial blood pressure  and is found to underestimate the risk of disease in female patients. Similar issues of fairness are found in models using genetic data. A polygenic risk model trained to analyse schizophrenia using only European data is found to have reduced performance in East Asian populations . Other Data Types:
 Multimodal models can simultaneously accept data input from different modalities including clinical text data, image data, waveform data and biomedical data. The multiple perspectives of medical data from different modalities provide information on patient treatment, allowing multimodal models to gradually show their unique advantages in the healthcare field . The research on the fairness issue of multimodal models is not many at current stage . A preliminary work presents a multimodal benchmark dataset consisting of 1794 patients and their corresponding EHR data and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) data, called RadFusion . The authors evaluate the performance of several representative multimodal fusion models on a diagnostic task of pulmonary embolism and benchmark their fairness in a protected subgroup. They find that the multimodal model improves diagnostic performance across the board, without introducing large differences in TPR between populations. Sources of Fairness Problems in Machine Learning:
 We have described in last section that many machine learning-based models suffer from fairness problems, and in this section, we attribute the reasons for these fairness problems. We use the term bias to denote the cause of the fairness problem , and there are various complex biases in the healthcare field. The process of building a machine learning-based healthcare system can be divided into three stages. First, the agency collects relevant clinical data for model development. Then the developers select and train a suitable model for the intended task, based on the data and the type of task. Finally, the model can be licensed by the institution concerned for deployment in real clinical practice. We introduce below the types of bias that can occur in the three phases (also refer to the overview in Figure ). Bias in Data Collection:
 Data collection is the first stage at which bias may be introduced. A machine learning model is trained to fit the distribution of the training data, and when there is bias in the data, the model perpetuates the bias. In the following paragraphs, we review several common types of data bias in clinical practice."

Given these complex and dynamic factors, machine learning approaches can be leveraged for prediction of glucose trends in the hospital to mitigate and prevent suboptimal hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic outcomes. Our aim was to review the clinical evidence for the role of machine learning–based models in predicting hospitalized patients’ glucose trajectory. The published literature on machine learning algorithms has varied in terms of population studied, outcomes of interest, and validation methods. There have been tools developed that utilize data from both continuous glucose monitors and large electronic health records (EHRs). With increasing sample sizes, inclusion of a greater number of predictor variables, and use of more advanced machine learning algorithms, there has been a trend in recent years towards increasing predictive accuracy for glycemic outcomes in the hospital setting. While current models predicting glucose trajectory offer promising results, they have not been tested prospectively in the clinical setting. Accurate machine learning algorithms have been developed and validated for prediction of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the hospital. Further work is needed in implementation/integration of machine learning models into EHR systems, with prospective studies to evaluate effectiveness and safety of such clinical decision support on glycemic and other clinical outcomes. ","review is to summarize machine learning-based models and clinical decision support tools for glycemic prediction in hospitalized patients. Our review focuses on the methodology used, hospital setting (ICU vs. non-ICU), model performance, and impact on clinical outcomes. Machine Learning Overview:
 Machine learning is the computational process of taking an input of data (i.e., independent variables) and an output (i.e., dependent variable) and uses different statistical rules based on the parameters of each model to create an algorithm that represents the relationship between the raw data and the output. Machine learning has been used throughout medicine to find patterns in genome sequencing, improve diagnostic pathology, and filter relevant problems during a patient's admission . EHR data is at the forefront of machine learning techniques due to the amount of raw information it possesses, and has been used to predict various disease phenotypes or diagnoses (e.g., congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Within the field of diabetes, machine learning has been implemented broadly to improve detection of diabetes diagnosis  and complications , cardiovascular risk stratification , and insulin dosing . An early application of machine learning in diabetes was a neural network model that achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 0.76 in predicting the onset of diabetes . Since then, landmark studies in the field have included a gradient boosting model that predicts glucose response prediction based on personal and microbiome factors  and a deep learning model that identifies diabetic retinopathy . Most notably, an initial closed-loop insulin delivery system was based on a rules-based model;  since then, bi-hormonal artificial pancreas technology has been associated with improved glycemic control when compared to sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy . Over the past few years, there has been growing scientific interest in the use of machine learning with large EHR datasets to predict glucose trends or required insulin doses in hospitalized patients. Phases of Machine Learning Research:
 Figure  outlines the development phases of machine learning-based research with application to the clinical topic of inpatient glycemic prediction . These steps include problem selection, data collection, machine learning development, model validation, assessment of impact, and deployment and monitoring . It is important to recognize that key differences in each of these phases of machine learning research will influence model results, comparability, and generalizability. Problem Selection and Study Population:
 The first step in machine learning development is defining the study problem and population of interest. The study problem defines the dependent variable, specifically the outcome that is being predicted (i.e., hypoglycemia over the next 24 h, hypoglycemia during any portion of a patient's admission, etc.). For inpatient glycemic prediction, potential populations include patients with known diabetes or specific type of diabetes (type 1 vs. type 2), patients with acute/stress hyperglycemia, and exposure to specific anti-hyperglycemic medications; populations may be limited to ICU or general floor patients. Selection of the study population will directly affect the generalizability and clinical application of the model. For example, a machine learning model derived from patients with only diagnosed T2DM at the time of admission could not be universally applied to all patients with diabetes."

Through its ability to automatically extract relevant features from retinal images, the model captured intricate patterns and structures indicative of these diseases. This allowed for accurate and reliable predictions, enabling early detection and intervention. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS:
 In validation tests, the system consistently performed well on unseen retinal images, highlighting its generalization capability. The performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, consistently indicated the system's effectiveness in accurately identifying diabetes-related eye diseases. The system's diagnostic reports provided valuable insights to healthcare professionals, facilitating timely and informed decision-making. The reports included information on the presence or absence of specific eye diseases, their severity levels, and recommendations for further medical assessment or treatment. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS:
 The integration of deep learning techniques in retinal image analysis has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of diabetes-based eye disease detection. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this system has the potential to revolutionize early diagnosis, enabling proactive management and ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of life. CHALLENGES:
 Implementing retinal image analysis for diabetes-based eye disease detection using deep learning poses several challenges. Here are some key challenges involved in this area. Limited and Imbalanced Datasets::
 Obtaining a large and diverse dataset of retinal images that covers a wide range of diabetes-related eye diseases can be challenging. Additionally, the dataset may suffer from class imbalance, where certain disease categories are underrepresented, making it difficult for the deep learning model to learn and generalize effectively. Visual content accessibility::
 Visually impaired users heavily rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers and braille displays to access website content. Ensuring that all visual elements, such as product images, banners, and icons, are adequately described using alternative text (alt text) is crucial for providing a meaningful experience to visually impaired users. Interpretability and Explainability::
 Deep learning models are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to interpret and explain the reasoning behind their predictions. In the context of retinal image analysis, it is crucial to understand the visual features or regions that contribute to the model's decision-making process. Developing explainable deep learning models for retinal image analysis remains an ongoing challenge. Robustness and Generalization::
 Deep learning models trained on a specific dataset may struggle to generalize well to different populations or imaging conditions. Variations in image quality, acquisition devices, and patient demographics can impact the model's performance and limit its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Ensuring robustness and generalization of the model is a challenge that needs to be addressed. IEthical and Privacy Concerns::
 Retinal images contain sensitive personal health information, raising concerns regarding patient privacy and data protection. Developing robust data anonymization and privacy preservation techniques is essential to ensure compliance with ethical and legal requirements. Balancing the need for accurate analysis with privacy concerns poses a significant challenge. Integration with Clinical Workflow::
 Integrating retinal image analysis systems into existing clinical workflows can be challenging. Seamless integration with electronic health record systems, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and other healthcare infrastructure requires careful coordination and adherence to interoperability standards. Real-Time Analysis and Deployment::
 Retinal image analysis systems should ideally provide real-time analysis to facilitate immediate decision-making. Achieving real-time performance while maintaining accuracy and reliability can be a computational challenge, especially when dealing with large image datasets and complex deep learning models."

There is an increasing demand for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and trends detection amongst people with diabetes and healthy individuals, especially athletes. Wearable devices and non-invasive sensors for blood glucose monitoring have witnessed considerable advances. This review is an update on recent contributions utilizing novel sensing technologies over the past five years which include electrocardiogram, electromagnetic, bioimpedance, photoplethysmography, and acceleration measures as well as bodily fluid glucose sensors to monitor glucose and trend detection. We also review methods that use machine learning algorithms to predict blood glucose trends, especially for high risk events such as hypoglycemia. Convolutional and recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees are examples of such machine learning algorithms. Finally, we address the key limitations and challenges of these studies and provide recommendations for future work.","Finally, the majority of devices remain in the development stage and require extra-large devices to be connected to read out the signal and provide the filtration needed . Electronics and mechanical miniaturization in wearable sensors represents a major limitation that requires further technological development and optimization . Data Acquisition and Model Generalizability:
 A key challenge in machine learning is acquiring enough comprehensive data to train and test a model that can then be generalized to a wider population. Many studies were limited in terms of the number of participants, duration of the study, and the incidence of clinically relevant severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, most studies established their methods and techniques in relation to CGM data that may be limited in certain scenarios. There is a need to include a larger population of patients, especially with diabetes, to account for the inter-individual differences and to establish better validation of the proposed solutions. To capture meaningful data, the duration of trials for data acquisition and the incidence of hypoglycemia need to be sufficient to avoid unbalanced or skewed data . In the case of imbalanced data, oversampling techniques can address this and improve the accuracy . Acquiring data from the same participant for longer periods allows the machine learning algorithm to combat intraindividual differences and increases overall prediction performance . The reliance on data annotated by the participants is an issue in acquiring accurate information as it depends solely on their commitment . The experimental conditions should not be controlled to allow data acquisition of more realistic daily life settings. Future studies should also include a wider set of physiological parameters to investigate their individual or collective effect on estimating blood glucose trends using machine learning techniques. Additionally, data assimilation techniques could be considered in conjunction with machine learning techniques using data acquired from several sources and wearables . Model Interpretability:
 Although machine learning algorithms have great predictive potential, the majority of these algorithms are black box models and lack the means to explain their predictions. The interpretability requirement of a machine learning model in health care is crucial . Clinicians need to make an informed decision based on a prediction but need to provide a proper explanation. Whilst wearable sensors are capable of estimating blood glucose trends based on physiological changes, such predictions without an underlying explanation may confuse the patient and render the wearable unreliable . Future studies must evaluate and incorporate interpretability techniques into their proposed solutions while making sure that the information acquired by the sensors are presented in a user-friendly interface . A support decision system along with the prediction was suggested to allow patients to provide feedback to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm in real-life scenarios . Another consideration of an algorithm is the computational cost and energy. A wearable device has limited resources to perform complex operations and to operate for a long duration. Hence, feature engineering and data reduction techniques are needed to reduce the computational cost and improve energy efficiency . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
 This review highlights the considerable progress made over the past five years in the area of non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using wearable technologies and sensors alongside machine learning algorithms. The devices have varied modalities and adopted technologies with novel approaches utilizing machine learning techniques to provide meaningful interpretations of multiple physiological parameters. However, there remain considerable limitations and challenges that hinder FDA approval and more widespread adoption of such technologies in patients. We therefore recommend future studies to focus on the following areas: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
 1. The recruitment of a larger number of participants especially patients with diabetes to validate the proposed techniques for use in the clinical arena."

The capability to detect diabetes early can improve the scope of disease management. For disease prognosis, artificial intelligence techniques are used widely. In this paper, probability and prediction for diabetes are discussed along with its model explanability and interpretability. A UCI repository's new diabetes dataset, which is collected from Bangladesh patients, is used. Various tools were used to interpret the model outcome, like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), tree-based model feature importance, partial dependency plots. A plethora of tree-based and other popular classification algorithms were used to build the diabetes prediction model. The findings indicated that using kernel-PCA before fitting random forest (RF) gives slightly better results than vanilla-RF. Our findings indicate a strong positive correlation with the 3Ps of diabetes, i.e., polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia, along with genital thrush, visual blurring, and delayed healing. Being a female in this dataset (derived from Bangladesh patients) have a high chance of diabetes. This represents the model's accuracy and reliability that eventually will be crucial in the trust of medical practitioners on the model outcome. The counter-intuitive outcome of individual data attributes was examined with model agnostic interpretability of machine learning techniques, which can be explained with domain knowledge of the data. The outcome also suggests that the model built on one domain, like population demographics, cannot be directly applied to other demographics. Any patterns observed in the data relevant to the model outcome should be well studied and explained, along with model accuracy metrics.","Diabetes, Interpretability, Explanability, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, Shapley Additive Explanations, Partial Dependence Plots, T-SNE, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Machine Learning INTRODUCTION:
 Diabetes is emerging as a concerning global health problem that is nearing epidemic proportions globally. According to an estimate of the International Diabetes Federation, the comparative prevalence of diabetes during 2007 was 8.0 % and likely to increase to 7.3% by 2025. The number of people with diabetes is 246 million and likely to increase to 380 million by 2025 . The three Ps of diabetes is Polyuria, Polydipsia, and Polyphagia. It is common for several symptoms to appear together, i.e., thirst (polydipsia), and an increased need to urinate (polyuria) will often come as a pair. The earlier diagnosis of diabetes would help in better management of the disease. Artificial Intelligence has helped make an early diagnosis of diabetes [3] . A robust interpretable model representing a good correlation with cardinal features of diabetes can provide more confidence to medical practitioners and patients in the model prognostics. A better understanding of how an algorithm works can help better align the model outcome with the critical questions required for validation. Amongst a wide variety of machine learning algorithms that were used to predict diabetes, some include the traditional machine learning method , linear models, tree-based models and support vector machine. Polat et. al.  used principal component analysis with neuro inference for diabetes detection. Yue et al.  used quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm and weighted least squares support vector machine Razavian et al.  implement linear models. Georga et al.  used multivariate prediction approach and Ozcift and Gulten  used futuristic model of rotation forest for diabetes prediction. Alama  implemented neural network, tree-based methods and clustering techniques are used to build prediction models for diabetes. INTRODUCTION:
 In this study, along with various tree-based and other popular classification algorithms, a wide range of techniques are used to make the model more explainable and interpretable. The focus is to explain the underlying data rather than purely focusing on model prediction accuracy. The paradox of correlation and causation is explored. The random forest model on this dataset already achieves 98% AUROC, so more emphasis is given on investigating the underlying data. The practical relevance of features with the problem statement, i.e., diabetes prediction, is emphasized, and results w.r.t to contributing features are explained with wide variety of techniques. A.

This is what differentiates our work from the others as mentioned in the related works in the introduction section. Discussion:
 Although, there are studies that support this relationship they include either a few variables or too many variables that include pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, the human level of accuracy cannot be measured which results in an unknown value for the Bayes error, the smallest error that can be achieved. Another complication is the dataset, although it has a reliable source it has a lot of missing values along with an unbalanced outcome. The original dataset has more than 55 thousand observations, but after removing all the observations of the participants aged less than 18 years old it drops down to only 35 thousand. The final dataset has 14682 observations with a ratio of 3.28 to 1 for normal, for every 3.28 observations for diabetes free comes 1 observation for with diabetes. With these drawbacks, the process of building the model became more challenging. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK:
 The use of machine learning in the medical field appears to be promising and has astonishing achievements. With the help of machine learning tools and algorithms, we were able to build a model that can predict with a Cross-Validation (10-fold) score of 0.864 and an average accuracy of 86%. The robustness, model performance with unseen data, of the model is nearly 85%. Also, the model could predict the outcome with a relatively low number of E2 and a high score of NPV. With results like these, our model can be classified as an acceptable model and can be deployed as an assistive tool for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. With a dataset of higher quality, our model performance will improve significantly. Finally, our model has been built with data that has been collected from the American population, so it may not perform as well with data from other regions because it may have a different distribution than the American population. However, our model can be tuned to perform better with a particular population with data from that population. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK:
 As for the future work, since a high-quality dataset leads to a high-performance model, the next step is to gather more data with higher quality, which means more observations, less or no missing values, more balanced outcomes, and from different parts of the world to help the model to generalize well. Also, other variables could be added like sleep patterns and hours, and water consumption. The new dataset then needs to be preprocessed in an optimal way. Next, we rebuild the model with the new dataset. These changes will result in a model with higher performance close to state-of-the-art performance. Then, the achieved model could be used for the diagnosing of type 2 diabetes with little human supervision. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST:

In this study, we applied multiple machine learning classifiers to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2015) dataset, which is inherently imbalanced. We tested four algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multilayer Perceptron - using both the original and the balanced datasets. Our results indicate that balancing the dataset through undersampling improves the performance of all four algorithms in predicting diabetes. Specifically, Logistic Regression showed an increase in Precision from 0.53 to 0.74, while Random Forest showed an increase in F1-score from 0.25 to 0.75. K-Nearest Neighbors showed an increase in Recall from 0.19 to 0.73, and Multilayer Perceptron showed a significant increase in F1-score from 0.38 to 0.78. Moreover, our findings reveal that undersampling can improve fairness by mitigating gender bias from machine learning models, as measured by the Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR). The experiments depict a change in DIR for most algorithms when trained on the balanced dataset, for logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbour DIR decreases from 1.16 to 1.12, 1.14 to 1.08, and 1.05 to 1.02 respectively, indicating that the models are becoming fairer towards both gender groups.

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into the healthcare system and has the potential to assist clinicians and medical doctors to take better care of patients Lin (2020); Liaw (2020); . It has been a long since machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed to help clinicians diagnose and treat a range of diseases, from deathly cancer to heart disease. With the advancement of data collection technology, the electronic health record (EHR), an electronic version of a patient's medical history, provides a vast amount of data that can be used to train these data-based algorithms RS . However, similar to other fields, the data in the medical field is highly imbalanced resulting in biased learning . As a matter of fact, the EHR data can be biased too, which could lead to unfair and potentially harmful decisions being made by machine learning algorithms as the models pick up the pattern from the provided data Ninareh Mehrabi (2021); ; Ghassemi (2020); Juhn Y (2020). Therefore, it is essential to evaluate and address potential biases in the EHR data used to train machine learning algorithms, especially before using them in practice where human lives are at stake. Introduction:
 Bias in machine learning models can be introduced in many different ways. For example, certain subgroups in the dataset may be underrepresented, leading to insufficient training data for the algorithms . This underrepresentation of such subgroups could result in biases in the algorithm's predictions and decision-making, potentially leading to harm to the users. Additionally, algorithms may be biased because of factors such as the way they are modelled and trained, underlying assumptions, or the type of dataset used to train them . These biases can lead to unfair decisions that may result in poorer outcomes for certain subgroups of patients which can have a serious impact on their lives. Introduction:
 Predicting chronic diseases like diabetes is one area where bias can have an adverse impact De . Millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes, a chronic condition that needs ongoing care to avoid long-term complications. The majority of the approximately 422 million people with diabetes worldwide reside in low-and middle-income nations and diabetes is directly responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually according to who. Over the past few decades, there has been a consistent rise in both the incidence and prevalence of diabetes . A critical first step in the prevention and treatment of disease is the identification of patients who are at risk of developing diabetes. With encouraging results, machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the onset of diabetes from EHR data . However, if these algorithms are biased, they might fail to identify patients with a high risk of developing diabetes, missing out on chances to prevent and treat the condition."

Most existing transfer learning research has been focused on model estimation, while there is a paucity of literature on transfer inference for model accuracy despite its importance. We propose a novel D oubly R obust A ugmented M odel A ccuracy T ransfer I nferen C e (DRA-MATIC) method for point and interval estimation of commonly used classiﬁcation performance measures in an unlabeled target population using labeled source data. Speciﬁcally, DRAMATIC derives and evaluates the risk model for a binary response Y against some low dimensional predictors A on the target population, leveraging Y from source data only and high-dimensional adjustment features X from both the source and target data. The method builds on top of an imputation model for the mean of Y | X and a density ratio model characterizing the distributional shift of X between the source and target populations. We ﬁrst develop a doubly robust estimating equation on the two models for the risk model of Y | A on the target population. Then a doubly robust estimation is constructed for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve used for the model accuracy evaluation. During the process, we mitigate the regularization biases incurred by the high-dimensional nuisance estimators of the imputation and density ratio models by constructing ap-propriate calibrated moment equations. The proposed estimators are doubly robust in the sense that they are n 12 consistent when at least one model is correctly speciﬁed, and certain model sparsity assumptions hold. that the point estimation has negligible bias and the conﬁdence intervals derived by DRAMATIC attain satisfactory empirical coverage levels. We further illustrate the utility of our method to transfer the genetic risk prediction model, and its accuracy evaluation for type II diabetes across two patient cohorts in Mass General Brigham (MGB) collected using diﬀerent sampling mechanisms and at diﬀerent time points.","Model Accuracy Transfer Inference with High Dimensional Features Authors: Doudou Zhou,Molei Liu,Mengyan Li,Tianxi Cai Keywords: transfer learning, covariate shift, model misspecification, doubly robust inference, high-dimensional inference Introduction 1.Background:
 While cohort studies remain to be critical sources for studying disease progression and treatment response, they have limitations, including the generalizability of the study findings to the real world, the limited ability to test broader hypotheses, and the cost associated with performing these studies. Introduction 1.Background:
 In recent years, due to the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and the linkage of EHR with specimen bio-repositories, integrated large datasets now exist as a new data source for deriving real-world predictive models. Introduction 1.Background:
 For example, the Massachusetts General and Brigham (MGB) Healthcare Biobank  and the million veteran's project  contain a wealth of both clinical and genomic data for patients enrolled in the biobanks. Introduction 1.Background:
 These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized risk prediction models, which can be easily integrated into clinical workflow to assist clinical decision-making. Introduction 1.Background:
 These models can also be contrasted and integrated with models derived from traditional cohort studies to improve generalizability. Introduction 1.Background:
 Efficiently deriving and evaluating prediction models using EHR data remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. First, gold standard labels on disease outcomes are typically not readily available in EHR and require accessibility of clinical notes and labor-intensive manual annotations. Introduction 1.Background:
 For example, at MGB, only ∼ 74% of patients with at least one diagnostic code of type II diabetes (T2D) have T2D . Introduction 1.Background:
 On the other hand, verifying true T2D status via manual chart review is laborious and thus only available for a small number of patients at MGB. Existing methods for deriving EHR risk models typically fit prediction models to inaccurate proxies of the true outcome, such as the presence or absence of a billing code or a classification derived from a machine learning algorithm . Introduction 1.Background:
 The misclassification error in the proxies can lead to biases in the derived prediction model and the estimated accuracy of the trained model. Introduction 1.Background:
 Another challenge associated with ensuring the generalizability of EHR derived model arises from the heterogeneity between different EHR cohorts. It is well-known that patient populations may differ substantially across different healthcare systems, leading to significant heterogeneity in the performance of prediction models . Introduction 1.Background:
 Risk prediction models derived to optimize one EHR cohort may not perform well for another cohort. In addition, data for EHR studies are often refreshed over time as new patients enter the study, and the data of existing patients get updated. Introduction 1.Background:
 Thus, EHR data from two different time points of the same institution can have a significant shift in their distribution. Introduction 1.Background:
 Both the scarcity of gold standard labels on disease outcomes and the covariate shift poses great challenges to generalizing knowledge about EHR-derived risk models from a labeled source population to a target population where gold standard labels are typically not available."

Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent and severe metabolic disorder disease that poses significant health risks globally, leading to substantial healthcare burdens. Recent days, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have markedly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of diabetes outcome predicted by machine learning (ML), offering a promising approach for early intervention and treatment. This paper evaluates several advanced ML models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks techniques based on neural networks. Each model's strengths and limitations are discussed, highlighting the improvements in predictive performance and diagnostic precision. Despite these advancements, the field faces ongoing challenges related to ethical considerations and data scale, which impact ML application in healthcare from both technical and moral aspects. Future efforts should focus on these challenges by promoting data sharing and integration while safeguarding privacy. Through these endeavors, we aim to advance the field of diabetes prediction and improve patient care. ","Alanazi, A. emphasized that the advent of novel technologies, such as ML algorithms, has given rise to noteworthy ethical quandaries. These may be attributed to several factors such as inadequate legislative safeguards, innate prejudices against minority groups, and restricted technological capabilities. Challenges and Future Directions:
 Experts stress that to develop ethical standards that address these concerns, thorough study is required. Furthermore, ML algorithms frequently make already-existing disparities in underlying data worse, which can disproportionately impact racial, ethnic, and gender groups. Therefore, creating thorough ethical frameworks is crucial to addressing these issues. Challenges and Future Directions:
 Even though the relevant application of machine learning in the field of diabetes prediction has reached a relatively mature stage, as mentioned above, it still has some problems in terms of morality and data scale. Challenges and Future Directions:
 Therefore, it is believed that the future research direction should start from these aspects, acquire more data while protecting privacy, and develop relevant moral frameworks to solve the ethical problems of AI. Challenges and Future Directions:
 In addition, the application of deep neural network in this field is also a new direction for the development of machine learning in the prediction of diabetes in the future. Conclusion:
 In conclusion, the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques in diabetes prediction has demonstrated significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, particularly through models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks approaches. These methodologies show promise for early intervention and improved patient care. Conclusion:
 However, the field faces critical challenges related to data accessibility and ethical considerations. The reluctance of healthcare institutions to share patient data hampers the scalability and effectiveness of ML systems, while ethical dilemmas arising from biases and a lack of regulatory frameworks further complicate implementation. Conclusion:
 To address these issues, future research must prioritize data sharing while ensuring privacy protection and develop robust ethical guidelines to navigate the moral complexities of AI in healthcare. Conclusion:
 By tackling these challenges, the potential of ML in enhancing diabetes prediction and overall patient outcomes can be fully realized, paving the way for more equitable and effective healthcare solutions."

Importantly, the success of any mitigation strategy strongly depends on the structure of the shift. Despite this, there has been little discussion of how to empirically assess the structure of a distribution shift that one is encountering in practice. In this work, we adopt a causal framing to motivate conditional independence tests as a key tool for characterizing distribution shifts. Using our approach in two medical applications, we show that this knowledge can help diagnose failures of fairness transfer, including cases where real-world shifts are more complex than is often assumed in the literature.

 As progress is made to integrate machine learning (ML) systems in real-world applications, one concern is how the ML model's behaviour might be affected by changes in the data distribution. While extensive work has investigated the effect of distribution shift on ML model performance [see  for reviews], recent work has also highlighted that fairness properties that are satisfied on the data used to develop a model might not always hold if the data distribution changes . In high-risk domains like healthcare, this can translate to 'if a model satisfies fairness criteria when trained in ""Hospital A"", it may not satisfy them when tested in ""Hospital B""'. Fueled by this observation, a new field of research is emerging to understand the relationship between ML fairness and robustness to distribution shift [e.g.  and to provide mitigation techniques for obtaining robustly fair ML models [e.g. . Importantly, the success of robustly fair machine learning depends strongly on the nature of the distribution shifts that the system will encounter in practice. This point has been made elegantly in existing work as a motivation to use causal structure to provide fairness guarantees for specified distribution shifts . However, to the best of our knowledge, few methods can diagnose the nature of the shift and guide towards an appropriate mitigation strategy . Introduction:
 In this work, we design statistical tests that can, based on a simplified causal graph of an application and a small target dataset, assess the structure of the distribution shift encountered by the system and identify aspects of the data that hinder the transfer of fairness properties. Using applications in dermatology and Electronic Health Records (EHR), we show that this analysis is crucial for selecting an appropriate mitigation strategy. Further, our work also reveals that clinically plausible shifts are often more complex than can be handled by current mitigation techniques, highlighting the need for additional research into a broader set of remedies across the entire ML pipeline. Background:
 Notation We consider problems where we are given variables X, A, Y , where X is a set of features, A is one or more sensitive attributes, and Y is an outcome or label to be predicted. Our goal is to build a classification or regression model f (X ), where, depending on the context, X := (X, A) or X := X. We are concerned with the fairness properties of f , both on the training distribution and in one or more deployed environments. Depending on the setting, we focus on several statistical definitions of fairness : gaps in subgroup accuracy, demographic parity, and equalized odds. See the Supplement for their formulation."

Results We find that optimized random forest models performed best to accurately predict the diagnosis of a diabetic complication, with the most effective model distinguishing between fast versus slow nephropathy (AUROC = 0.75). Using all data sets combined allowed for the highest model predictive performance, and social history or laboratory alone were most predictive.

It can occur when the body does not produce enough insulin or when cells become resistant to insulin’s effects. There are two main types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2, which have different causes and risk factors. Early detection of diabetes allows for early intervention and management of the condition. This can help prevent or delay the development of serious complications associated with diabetes. Early diagnosis also allows for individuals to make lifestyle changes to prevent the progression of the disease. Healthcare systems play a vital role in the management and treatment of diabetes. They provide access to diabetes education, regular check-ups, and necessary medications for individuals with diabetes. They also provide monitoring and management of diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy. Through early detection, prevention and management programs, healthcare systems can help improve the quality of life and outcomes for people with diabetes. Current initiatives in healthcare systems for diabetes may fail due to lack of access to education and resources for individuals with diabetes. There may also be inadequate follow-up and monitoring for those who have been diagnosed, leading to poor management of the disease and lack of prevention of complications. Additionally, current initiatives may not be tailored to specific cultural or demographic groups, resulting in a lack of effectiveness for certain populations.

Related Literature:
 Previously in the literature, there can be noticed a limited consideration of the impact of comorbidities: diabetes is often accompanied by other chronic diseases, yet most studies on diabetes prediction have not considered the impact of comorbidities on diabetes risk. Furthermore, previous studies lack long-term follow-up and display limited use of multifactorial and advanced machine learning methods which could improve the performance of prediction models.

 Chronic diseases are known to affect the way of life negatively  and have financial impact on individuals, governments and groups while tackling the chronic diseases . Diabetes mellitus is one such example categorized by high levels of blood glucose  leading to severe damage of the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves . Diabetes is a growing health challenge of this era irrespective of geographic, racial and ethnic background . As recorded by World Health Organization (WHO), the number of diabetic patients globally has rapidly grown from 1m in 1980 to 422m in 2014, and it is increasing steadily especially in low and middle-income countries . According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), about Models for likelihood prediction of diabetes 463m people between the ages of 20 and 79 years are diabetes patients, and it is estimated that by 2045, the figure would have increased to 700m . It is also referred to as one of the major causes of death with annual death toll of 1.6m . Introduction:
 Researchers have divided diabetes mellitus into three major types: Type 1 diabetes is a serious and ceaseless illness  wherein the immune system wrongly attacks the pancreatic beta cells, thus causing insufficient or no insulin production. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is caused when the body uses insulin ineffectively while gestational diabetes occurs only during pregnancy  as a result of hormonal changes . Introduction:
 While heavy financial burden of diagnosing and managing the disease is experienced by government, individuals and groups and the prevalence rate is growing, a study  established that in 2019, diabetes caused at least 760bn dollars, thus demanding to find ways and means to eradicate or reduce this burden to the barest minimum. In this regard, one of the issues is identifying the risk of diabetes at its early phase  as early diagnosis and use of suitable therapeutic management support patient compliance and reduce the overweight expenses. Introduction:
 Established methods of diagnosing diabetes are Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and HbA1c test once the patients develop certain type of symptoms and need resources and time. In addition, such resources are not available at distant places . Once diagnosed, the treatment process is long-term and expensive. Therefore, the earlier it is detected, the better it is managed in terms of disease and the expenses . Introduction:
 In recent years, machine learning has been employed in prediction of most, if not all, of human activities and natural phenomenon and the health sector is not exempted. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence uses scientific algorithms and models that computer system uses to perform tasks efficiently, without using explicit instructions, but depending on patterns and inference instead .

This progress has emphasized that, from model development to model deployment, data play central roles. In this Review, we provide a data-centric view of the innovations and challenges that are defining ML for healthcare. We discuss deep generative models and federated learning as strategies to augment datasets for improved model performance, as well as the use of the more recent transformer models for handling larger datasets and enhancing the modelling of clinical text. We also discuss data-focused problems in the deployment of ML, emphasizing the need to efficiently deliver data to ML models for timely clinical predictions and to account for natural data shifts that can deteriorate model performance. ","the deployment data diverging from the distribution of the training data. This can lead to a decline in model performance. Also, failure to correct for data shifts can lead to the perpetuation of algorithmic biases, missing critical diagnoses and unnecessary clinical interventions . Delivering data to models.:
 In healthcare, data shifts are common occurrences and exist primarily along the axes of institutional differences (such as local clinical practices, or different instruments and data-collection workflows), epidemiological shifts, temporal shifts (for example, changes in physician and patient behaviours over time) and differences in patient demographics (such as race, gender and age). A recent case study  characterizing data shifts caused by institutional differences reported that pneumothorax classifiers trained trained with these datasets deteriorates for non-Caucasian subgroups, and especially for Medicare patients  . Similarly, skin-lesion classifiers that were trained primarily on images of one skin tone decrease in performance when evaluated on images of different skin tones  ; in this case, the drop in performance could be attributed to variations in disease presentation that are not captured when certain patient populations are not adequately represented in the training dataset  . These findings exemplify two underlying limitations of ML models: the models can propagate existing healthcare biases on a large scale, and insufficient diversity in the training datasets can lead to an inadequate generalization of model outputs to different patient populations. Training models on multi-institutional datasets can be most effective at combating model deterioration  , and directly combating existing biases in the training data can also mitigate their impact  . There are also solutions for addressing data shifts that involve proactively addressing them during model development  or retroactively by surveilling for data shifts during model deployment  . A proactive attitude towards recognizing and addressing potential biases and data shifts will remain imperative. outlook Substantial progress in the past decade has laid a foundation of knowledge for the application of ML to healthcare. In pursuing the deployment of ML models, it is clear that success is dictated by how data are collected, organized, protected, moved and audited. In this Review, we have highlighted methods that can address these challenges. The emphasis will eventually shift to how to build the tools, infrastructure and regulations needed to efficiently deploy innovations in ML in clinical settings. A central challenge will be the implementation and translation of these advances into healthcare in the face of their current limitations: for instance, GANs applied to medical images are currently limited by image resolution and image diversity, and can be challenging to train and scale; federated if deployed today, models that have been trained on older datasets would be making inferences on newly generated data."

Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials are needed to potentially overcome this bias and establish the model performance against the standard clinical parameters. In addition, imputation methods such as MICE have been used to address the missing data issue . Discussions:
 Furthermore, the creation of bigger datasets by pooling data from multiple hospital systems has led to a lack of standardization of datasets, potentially compromising the quality of analysis. Datasets might internally differ from each other because of the different mechanisms used to generate them. For instance, one dataset might define the presence of diabetes mellitus through ICD-10 codes, while another dataset might define it using glycemic indices, such as the hemoglobin A1c. On a similar theme, ML models developed by using imaging modalities deserve a special mention. For instance, differences can exist at the level of image scanning (different scanner characteristics and vendors), image quality (radiation dose, motion artifacts), and image processing (reconstruction filters, post-processing) which can potentially lead to significant variability and differences of the assimilated data. A prerequisite to the development of any ML model is the centralization of data, which is tedious given the different image processing algorithms employed at various institutions. This lack of standardization needs to be addressed before AI can be fully integrated into clinical practice. Discussions:
 Overfitting is another concern encountered during ML model development, which occurs when the algorithm learns the data 'too well' and interprets the signal noise as concepts . This usually happens with smaller datasets and can lead to a lack of external validity, despite high performance in the training and internal validation datasets. A definite solution is k-fold cross-validation, whereby data is randomly divided into an arbitrary k number of partitions. The model is trained using k − 1 number of data subsets and tested on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k total number of times, using different combinations of training and testing datasets to select the best model hyperparameters to yield the final model. This can potentially reduce noise and lead to better generalizability of the model in the overall population. Discussions:
 Apart from the problems encountered at the model development and training phase, there are a few noteworthy practical limitations to the implementation of ML within healthcare workflows. Firstly, unauthorized data access is an issue, as handling such large amounts of data also poses a risk of leaking sensitive patient information, thereby violating patient confidentiality and privacy . Furthermore, comparisons between various machine-learning methods are difficult, given the different combinations of model parameters and different population characteristics used for in model development. Hence, it becomes difficult for physicians to compare and choose one model over the other. Prospective future trials, comparing these models on the same dataset, are needed to select the best algorithm fit for integration into routine clinical decision-making. Proper integration of AI can only be achieved once these models are embedded within EHRs. However, the full implementation and assimilation of developed AI models into EHRs can be a complex issue, as it depends on organizational resources and patient-privacy policies. Furthermore, available algorithms may be limited to off-the-shelf ML models, rather than more intricate and complex neural networks, which is easier to implement in a real clinical setting. Yet, a data-driven approach utilizing advanced analytic techniques can help clinicians and patients to make informed decisions, improve care, and optimize workflow efficiency."

In this study, we propose a data mining based model for early diagnosis and prediction of diabetes using the UCI database. Although K-means is simple and can be used for a wide variety of data types, it is quite sensitive to initial positions of cluster centers which determine the final cluster result, which either provides a sufficient and efficiently clustered dataset for the logistic regression model, or gives a lesser amount of data as a result of incorrect clustering of the original dataset, thereby limiting the performance of the logistic regression model. Our findings offer insights into the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each method, shedding light on their potential applications in diabetes diagnosis and risk assessment. A further experiment with a new dataset showed the applicability of our model for the predication of diabetes. ","STUDY: In Ref. , the authors used k-means clustering in identifying and eliminating outliers, a genetic algorithm and correlation based feature selection (CFS) for relevant feature extraction, and finally used knearest neighbor(KNN) for classification of diabetic patients.

Recently, some studies approached the diabetes care domain through the analysis of the modifications of cardiovascular system parameters. In fact, cardiovascular diseases are the first leading cause of death in diabetic subjects. Thanks to their cost effectiveness and their ease of use, electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals have recently been used in diabetes detection, blood glucose estimation and diabetes-related complication detection. This review’s aim is to provide a detailed overview of all the published methods, from the traditional (non machine learning) to the deep learning approaches, to detect and manage diabetes using PPG and ECG signals. This review will allow researchers to compare and understand the differences, in terms of results, amount of data and complexity that each type of approach provides and requires. (2) Method: We performed a systematic review based on articles that focus on the use of ECG and PPG signals in diabetes care. The search was focused on keywords related to the topic, such as “Diabetes”, “ECG”, “PPG”, “Machine Learning”, etc. This was performed using databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar and IEEE Xplore. This review’s aim is to provide a detailed overview of all the published methods, from the traditional (non machine learning) to the deep learning approaches, to detect and manage diabetes using PPG and ECG signals. This review will allow researchers to compare and understand the differences, in terms of results, amount of data and complexity that each type of approach provides and requires. (3) Results: A total of 78 studies were included. The majority of the selected studies focused on blood glucose estimation (41) and diabetes detection (31). Only 7 studies focused on diabetes complications detection. We present these studies by approach: traditional, machine learning and deep learning approaches.

Clinical validation and data processing standardization need to be improved in order to employ these techniques in a clinical environment.","them). The sub dataset is composed of 4 diabetic without complications and 66 subjects with complications. The model scored an accuracy of 98.5%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%. Table contains the details of the cited article. Deep Learning: Main Outcomes:
 The main advantage of deep learning approaches is the possibility of avoiding the feature extraction step that can be very challenging when real ECG and/or PPG signals are employed. This capability is mostly employed in diabetes detection, while for blood glucose estimation and diabetes-related complications, features-based approaches are still preferred. Among the possible features, HRV-derived features are the most common ones. Also in this case, as for machine learning, particular attention should be put in correctly splitting the dataset to avoid biased results. Although it is well accepted that deep learning requires a large amount of data to produce reliable results, the majority of the studies used small datasets. This fact could be justified by the low complexity of the proposed models. In fact, as shown by Brigato et al. , low complexity models perform comparably well or better than high complexity models when dealing with small datasets. However, significant work has to be done in order to further study the models' interpretability and clinical validation. It is a crucial requirement that needs to be satisfied to employ deep learning models in a clinical environment."

Owing to the complexity of the blood glucose dynamics, it is difficult to design accurate predictive models in every circumstance, i.e., hypo/normo/hyperglycemic events. We developed deep-learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patient-specific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5 min to 1 h. In general, the major challenges to address are (1) the dataset of each patient is often too small to train a patient-specific deep-learning model, and (2) the dataset is usually highly imbalanced given that hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes are usually much less common than normoglycemia. We tackle these two challenges using transfer learning and data augmentation, respectively. We systematically examined three neural network architectures, different loss functions, four transfer-learning strategies, and four data augmentation techniques, including mixup and generative models. Taken together, utilizing these methodologies we achieved over 95% prediction accuracy and 90% sensitivity for a time period within the clinically useful 1 h prediction horizon that would allow a patient to react and correct either hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. We have also demonstrated that the same network architecture and transfer-learning methods perform well for the type 1 diabetes OhioT1DM public dataset.","different but related problem (i.e., patient-specific data). Transfer learning has been employed in blood glucose prediction very recently , but in these studies the patient-specific model based on transfer learning performed similarly to the population-based model or other classic machine learning models. INTRODUCTION:
 In addition to the problem of small data, another challenge in diabetic blood glucose prediction is the data imbalance.I n particular, the dataset of normal-level blood glucose measurements (called majority class) is orders-of-magnitude larger than the dataset of blood glucose measurements with specific symptom (called minority class), e.g., hypoglycemia. The model trained on the imbalanced dataset leads to a biased performance, i.e., the accuracy of the minority class is much worse than that of the majority class  . To address the data imbalance issue, various general approaches have been developed  , including preprocessing approaches, algorithmic centered approaches, and hybrid approaches, but learning from imbalanced data effectively and efficiently is still an open problem  ."

One fundamental component of analytical approaches is the computation of suitable metrics to assess outcomes, like blood glucose control that can be evaluated in terms of TIR. Then, data-driven methods can be used to extract suitable and representative patterns from the data. For example, 24-hour ""basic"" motifs can be found in a large series of CGM data so that one can classify any other 24-hour blood glucose profile as belonging to these clusters for the purpose of data compression and encryption, pattern recognition and predictions, decision support, and closed-loop control.

There are two main reasons behind this perception of the disease. First, a gradual but exponential growth in the disease prevalence has been witnessed irrespective of age groups, geography or gender. Second, the disease dynamics are very complex in terms of multifactorial risks involved, initial asymptomatic period, different short-term and long-term complications posing serious health threat and related co-morbidities. Majority of its risk factors are lifestyle habits like physical inactivity, lack of exercise, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, smoking except some inevitable ones like family history of diabetes, ethnic predisposition, ageing etc. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being applied for alleviation of diabetes health burden and many research works have been proposed in the literature to offer clinical decision support in different application areas as well. In this paper, we present a review of such efforts for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Firstly, we present the medical gaps in diabetes knowledge base, guidelines and medical practice identified from relevant articles and highlight those that can be addressed by ML. Further, we review the ML research works in three different application areas namely-(1) risk assessment (statistical risk scores and ML-based risk models), (2) diagnosis (using non-invasive and invasive features), (3) prognosis (from normoglycemia/prior morbidity to incident diabetes and prognosis of incident diabetes to related complications).

They laid out analysis of candidate studies at two levels-at primary level, discriminative power, calibration and classification accuracy are used and at secondary level, predictors, algorithms, validation degree and intended use of the model are suggested for inclusion. Background:
 We present a comprehensive review of ML research efforts for T2D clinical decision support aimed at its prevention and management. The review included selected papers from the medical literature as well as recent papers from ML literature to identify and highlight both medical as well as technological gaps in ML predictive models for T2D. Three main application areas namely risk assessment, diagnosis and prognosis of T2D using ML have been identified and individual studies in each category are reviewed based on the dataset characteristics (size, features used), methodology (consisting of pre-processing, feature extraction and classification steps), techniques/algorithms used in each step and their performance. The review results are organized as follows-(1) risk assessment using statistical risk scores and ML based risk models (2) diagnosis using invasive and non-invasive features (3) prognosis of T2D incidence and prognosis of T2D to associated complications. Materials and methods:
 A literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify relevant research papers in the area of ML-based diabetes clinical decision support. Search strategy:
 The search criterion comprised of four keywords-'Diabetes', 'Prediction', 'Machine Learning' and 'Clinical decision support', where AND operator was used to combine the former keyword with the latter three keywords individually. Since many of the existing T2D research works involving ML did not mention the diabetes type considered in either title or abstract, the usage of 'Type 2 Diabetes' as a search keyword was not found to be effective. The search was conducted from 2015 to present with English as the publication language. Figure  depicts the search strategy that involves initial screening based on titles, followed by abstracts and finally full text read as shown in Redundant articles were excluded at each stage of search process. Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
 This review primarily focuses on T2D, which is acquired mainly through lifestyle habits and is preventable to a great extent. Articles proposed for type 2 diabetes only were included for the study and articles focusing on type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes were eliminated. We have considered research involving clinical decision support for T2D aimed at its prevention and management that includes diagnosis, risk assessment and prognosis.

There are two main reasons behind this perception of the disease. First, a gradual but exponential growth in the disease prevalence has been witnessed irrespective of age groups, geography or gender. Second, the disease dynamics are very complex in terms of multifactorial risks involved, initial asymptomatic period, different short-term and long-term complications posing serious health threat and related co-morbidities. Majority of its risk factors are lifestyle habits like physical inactivity, lack of exercise, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, smoking except some inevitable ones like family history of diabetes, ethnic predisposition, ageing etc. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being applied for alleviation of diabetes health burden and many research works have been proposed in the literature to offer clinical decision support in different application areas as well. In this paper, we present a review of such efforts for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Firstly, we present the medical gaps in diabetes knowledge base, guidelines and medical practice identified from relevant articles and highlight those that can be addressed by ML. Further, we review the ML research works in three different application areas namely-(1) risk assessment (statistical risk scores and ML-based risk models), (2) diagnosis (using non-invasive and invasive features), (3) prognosis (from normoglycemia/prior morbidity to incident diabetes and prognosis of incident diabetes to related complications). We discuss and summarize the shortcomings or gaps in the existing ML methodologies for diabetes to be addressed in future. This review provides the breadth of ML predictive modeling applications for diabetes while highlighting the medical and technological gaps as well as various aspects involved in ML-based diabetes clinical decision support. ","to ML studies. They laid out analysis of candidate studies at two levels-at primary level, discriminative power, calibration and classification accuracy are used and at secondary level, predictors, algorithms, validation degree and intended use of the model are suggested for inclusion. Background:
 We present a comprehensive review of ML research efforts for T2D clinical decision support aimed at its prevention and management. The review included selected papers from the medical literature as well as recent papers from ML literature to identify and highlight both medical as well as technological gaps in ML predictive models for T2D. Three main application areas namely risk assessment, diagnosis and prognosis of T2D using ML have been identified and individual studies in each category are reviewed based on the dataset characteristics (size, features used), methodology (consisting of pre-processing, feature extraction and classification steps), techniques/algorithms used in each step and their performance. The review results are organized as follows-(1) risk assessment using statistical risk scores and ML based risk models (2) diagnosis using invasive and non-invasive features (3) prognosis of T2D incidence and prognosis of T2D to associated complications. Materials and methods:
 A literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify relevant research papers in the area of ML-based diabetes clinical decision support. Search strategy:
 The search criterion comprised of four keywords-'Diabetes', 'Prediction', 'Machine Learning' and 'Clinical decision support', where AND operator was used to combine the former keyword with the latter three keywords individually. Since many of the existing T2D research works involving ML did not mention the diabetes type considered in either title or abstract, the usage of 'Type 2 Diabetes' as a search keyword was not found to be effective. The search was conducted from 2015 to present with English as the publication language. Figure  depicts the search strategy that involves initial screening based on titles, followed by abstracts and finally full text read as shown in Redundant articles were excluded at each stage of search process. Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
 This review primarily focuses on T2D, which is acquired mainly through lifestyle habits and is preventable to a great extent. Articles proposed for type 2 diabetes only were included for the study and articles focusing on type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes were eliminated. We have considered research involving clinical decision support for T2D aimed at its prevention and management that includes diagnosis, risk assessment and prognosis. The articles proposed for treatment prediction, self-management and related complications and their severity assessment are excluded.

No studies have assessed whether these two approaches reach comparable predictions. This study compares the predictive performance of these two data sources and examines the algorithmic fairness of the developed models. We developed XGBoost models to predict the two-year risk of nephropathy, tissue infection, and cardiovascular events in Type 2 Diabetes patients. The models using only clinical data achieved an average AUC of 0.78, while the models using administrative health data alone achieved 0.77. A hybrid model combining both data types resulted in an average AUC of 0.80, across complications. The models showed that laboratory data were key for predicting nephropathy, whereas comorbidity and diabetes age were most important for tissue infection. For cardiovascular events, age and a history of congestive heart failure was the most important predictors. Our analysis identified bias on the feature sex in all three outcomes: models tended to underestimate risk for females and overestimate it for males, indicating a need to address fairness in these applications. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML models using both data types for predicting diabetes complications. However, the presence of sex bias highlights the importance of improving model fairness for reliable clinical use.","complications using data from two perspectives: a clinical setting with EHR and laboratory data, and a public health setting using administrative health and demographic data. Discussion: A secondary objective was to assess the algorithmic fairness of the models with all available data. Discussion:
 Our results show that in general, predictive performance is quite comparable between the clinical and public health approaches, despite variation in model performance across complications. Across complications,  models using age, sex, and diagnosis history alone had the worst predictive performance. Discussion:
 Inclusion of lab data or hospital utilization and socio-demographic characteristics improved model performance, and inclusion of both categories of information produces the strongest performing models (except cardiovascular complications, where health data does not augment the performance of AHD models). Discussion:
 Algorithmic fairness analysis revealed evidence of strong bias in predictive models by sex, and bias when HbA1c data was missing for nephropathy. Similar sex bias against females, including high false negative rates, in ML models have been documented for other health-related outcomes  . Discussion:
 Existing literature documents both differential risk of diabetic complications and differences in the predicted risk between sexes, which could contribute to the model unfairness  . Divergence in health outcomes between sexes and the existence of sexrelated bias in ML prediction, point to the importance reporting fairness in ML modeling. Discussion:
 This may highlight a need for development of sex-specific models of diabetic complications. Discussion:
 The two data sources and approaches to ML prediction of diabetes complications show little difference in predictive performance, and predictions are quite comparable at the individual level. Nonetheless, model performance is greatest with the inclusion of both data types. Discussion:
 These findings suggest that the two approaches can supplement each other without a risk of contradictory predictions and implicated treatment recommendations, and that inclusion of all available data in either setting is advantageous. Discussion:
 This study has several limitations. We only evaluated a two-year buffer between predictor measurement and outcome, and did not explore how alternative buffer durations might affect model performance. Discussion:
 Optimal buffer lengths may differ by outcome e.g., cardiovascular events might benefit from a longer buffer to capture relevant risk factors in time for intervention. Discussion:
 We assessed model performance exclusively using XGBoost. While more advanced algorithms may improve accuracy, our focus was on relative rather than absolute performance. XGBoost remains a strong and commonly used algorithm for structured data due to its robustness, interpretability, and scalability, making it appropriate for this study. Discussion:
 However, different models might rely on different features for prediction, and algorithmic fairness assessment could be different, using other models. Discussion:
 The models were developed using data from Denmark, which may limit their generalizability to other populations. Differences in healthcare policies, clinical practices, and individual health behaviors across countries could affect both predictive performance and fairness outcomes. Discussion:
 Some performance metrics, particularly the F1-score and precision, were relatively low, which reflects the highly imbalanced nature of the data. However, the primary aim of the study was to assess relative differences across data sources and to evaluate the algorithmic fairness of the models. Discussion:
 While the absolute values of these metrics should be interpreted cautiously, the fairness-oriented insights remain valid and highlight an important consideration when applying ML in decision-making contexts."

By 2015, diabetes had affected more than 415 million people worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation report, this figure is expected to rise to more than 642 million in 2040, so early screening and diagnosis of diabetes patients have great significance in detecting and treating diabetes on time. Diabetes is a multifactorial metabolic disease, its diagnostic criteria is difficult to cover all the ethology, damage degree, pathogenesis and other factors, so there is a situation for uncertainty and imprecision under various aspects of medical diagnosis process. With the development of Data mining, researchers find that machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in diabetes research. Machine learning techniques can find the risky factors of diabetes and reasonable threshold of physiological parameters to unearth hidden knowledge from a huge amount of diabetes-related data, which has a very important significance for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. So this paper provides a survey of machine learning techniques that has been applied to diabetes data screening and diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, conventional machine learning techniques are described in early screening and diagnosis of diabetes, moreover deep learning techniques which have a significance of biomedical effect are also described.","pathogenesis of diabetes from the field of biology. It is urgent to clarify the pathology and diagnostic criteria of diabetes, it has a great significance in delaying the occurrence and development of diabetes, choosing drugs, reducing the incidence of diabetic complications and extending life expectancy. INTRODUCTION:
 With the continuous development of artificial intelligence and data mining technology, researchers begin to consider using machine learning techniques to search for the characteristics of diabetes. Machine learning techniques can find implied pathogenic factors in virtue of analysing and using diabetic data, with a high stability and accuracy in diabetic diagnosis. Therefore, machine learning techniques which can find out the reasonable threshold of risky factors and physiological parameters provide new ideas for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. INTRODUCTION:
 This paper is organized as the following: Section 2 offers the application of conventional machine learning methods in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This section introduces the supervised learning method represented by decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) , artificial neural network (ANN) and the unsupervised learning method represented by clustering and association rules. Section 3 introduces the advantages of deep learning technology in medical data processing compared to conventional machine learning methods. Various applications of several network structures will then be introduced, such as deep belief network (DBN), deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are applied in extracting feature, diagnosing disease and laying the foundation for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. Section 4 presents discussion and future works. CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES:
 Diabetic diagnosis is based on a variety of epidemiology and genetic factors. Dangerous factors of epidemiology include smoking status, eating habits, physical activity, BMI and so on. Genetic factors are pathogenic genes which come from parents. Hence, doctors hope to consider all aspects of these factors and then predict and diagnose diabetes accurately; nevertheless researchers from the medical domain found that they could not explain the pathogenesis of diabetes. With the continuous development of Artificial Intelligence Technology, it has been found that machine learning techniques are very suitable for finding the reasonable threshold of risky factors and physiological parameters affecting diabetes. Why machine learning can achieve significant achievement in the medical domain? First of all, diabetes is a kind of chronic disease, and a lot of clinical treatment information will be generated in the process of treatment. Meanwhile, machine learning has giant advantages in handling big data problems, so the machine learning techniques can be applied to the analysis and processing of diabetes data. Secondly machine learning and medical diagnosis have the uniform objective to extract the correct and valuable information from a large number of data for making decisions. At the same time, machine learning techniques can avoid the misdiagnosis of inexperienced or tired human experts, and have a high stability and accuracy in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes . Furthermore, machine learning techniques can also help patients have a clear idea of their health status as well as the situation of diabetic development, then patients can plan their own lifestyle to slow the deterioration of disease . Therefore, we hope that we can use machine learning techniques to find pathogenesis of diabetes which cannot be found in the medical domain, which has great significance for treatment of diabetes patients early, the appropriate use of medicine and early rehabilitation. In this paper, the applications of conventional machine learning techniques in the early screening and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus will be introduced from two aspects: supervised learning and unsupervised learning."

However, if the machine does, who will be held accountable? Furthermore, fairness is an issue in ML because most ML models are skewed towards the majority class. As a result, future research should concentrate on ML ethics and fairness. Discussion:
 Model interpretation is absent in nearly all investigations, which is surprising. Interpreting machine learning models used to be difficult, but explainable and interpretable XAI have made it much easier. Despite the fact that the previous MLBDD lacked sufficient interpretations, it is projected that future researchers and practitioners would devote more attention to interpreting the machine learning model due to the growing demand for model interpretability. Discussion:
 The idea that ML alone will enough to construct an MLBDD model is a flawed one. To make the MLBDD model more dynamic, it may be anticipated that the model will need to be developed and stored on a cloud system, as the heath care industry generates a lot of data that is typically kept in cloud systems. As a result, the adversarial attack will focus on patients' data, which is very sensitive. For future ML-based models, the data bridge and security challenges must be taken into consideration. Discussion:
 It is a major issue to analyze data if there is a large disparity in the data. As the ML-based diagnostic model deals with human life, every misdiagnosis is a possible danger to one's health. However, despite the fact that many study used the imbalance dataset to perform their experiment, none of the cited literature highlights issues related to imbalance data. Thus, future work should demonstrate the validity of any ML models while developing with imbalanced data. Discussion:
 Within the many scopes this review paper also have some limitations which can be summarized as follows: Discussion:
 The study first searched the Scopus and WOS databases for relevant papers and then examined other papers that were pertinent to this investigation. If other databases like Google Scholar and Pubmed were used, the findings might be somewhat different. Discussion:
 As a result, our study may provide some insight into MLBDD, but there is still a great deal of information that is outside of our control. 2. Discussion:
 ML algorithms, DL algorithms, dataset, disease classifications, and evaluation metrics are highlighted in the review. Though the suggested ML process is thoroughly examined in reference literature, this paper does not go into that level of detail. 3.:
 Only those publications that adhered to a systematic literature review technique were included in the study's paper selection process. Using a more comprehensive range of keywords, on the other hand, might lead to higher search activity. However, our SLR approach will provide researchers and practitioners with a more thorough understanding of MLBDD. Research Challenges and Future Agenda:
 While machine learning-based applications have been used extensively in disease diagnosis, researchers and practitioners still face several challenges when deploying them as a practical application in healthcare. In this section, the key challenges associated with ML in disease diagnosis have been summarized as follows: Wrong image segmentation: One of the key challenges with the ML model is that the model often identifies the wrong region as an infected region. For instance, author  shows that even though the accuracy is around 100% in detecting COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16 and VGG19 often pay attention to the wrong region during the training process ."

 Artificial intelligence (AI) has provided new powerful approaches to addressing various problems in medicine . This work focuses on machine learning (ML) applications in diagnosing and treating diabetes. Since most ML techniques are data-driven, the source, type, and quality of data play an important role in the performance, accuracy, and reliability of the developed ML models. The data used can be subjective, objective, or a combination of both . Subjective sources of data include diaries kept by the individual, her/his responses to questionnaires, and self-reported information such as meals and physical activities entered in various apps that collect such data. Objective data are collected by devices that record measurements of numerous physiological variables and test results reported. Challenges to objective data quality include accuracy of measurements, effects of measurement noise and artifacts, missing values, and outliers in data. Under or overestimation of food consumed, variations in the level of stress or pain perceived by the patient, and forgetting entries to dairies are common in subjective data. When data are collected for various classes of events, the balance in the number of samples in each class can also influence or bias the results of the ML algorithms. This manuscript will first discuss data preprocessing methods to reduce the influence of imbalances and faults in data. Then it will illustrate the use of ML in addressing various challenges in the treatment of diabetes. Introduction:
 Diabetes, a chronic disease that affects one out of every eleven people around the world, will be used to illustrate the ML applications for detection, classification, and prediction problems. Diabetes has a large impact on the quality of life of people with diabetes and a significant financial burden on individuals and society . Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are two major types of diabetes . T1D is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency, a result of the loss of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. T2D is characterized by the ineffective use of insulin in the body and defects in insulin secretion that lead to relative insulin deficiency in relation to the increased insulin requirements imposed by the insulin-resistant state. While the cure of diabetes is the objective of many active research programs, there is no cure approved to date to eliminate diabetes . Many activities focus on improving the treatment of diabetes using various classes of pharmacological drugs and medical devices that can help improve the regulation of blood glucose concentrations (BGC) in people with diabetes ."

However, these predictive models have several limitations, such as user convenience and reproducibility. The purpose of this study was to develop a T2DM predictive model using electronic medical records (EMRs) and machine learning and to compare the performance of this model with traditional statistical methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, a total of available 8454 patients who had no history of diabetes and were treated at the cardiovascular center of Korea University Guro Hospital were enrolled. All subjects completed 5 years of follow up. The prevalence of T2DM during follow up was 4.78% (404/8454). A total of 28 variables were extracted from the EMRs. In order to verify the cross-validation test according to the prediction model, logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm models were generated. The LR model was considered as the existing statistical analysis method. RESULTS All predictive models maintained a change within the standard deviation of area under the curve (AUC) <0.01 in the analysis after a 10-fold cross-validation test. Among all predictive models, the LR learning model showed the highest prediction performance, with an AUC of 0.78. However, compared to the LR model, the LDA, QDA, and KNN models did not show a statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION We successfully developed and verified a T2DM prediction system using machine learning and an EMR database, and it predicted the 5-year occurrence of T2DM similarly to with a traditional prediction model. In further study, it is necessary to apply and verify the prediction model through clinical research.","Authors: Byoung Geol Choi,Seung-Woon Rha,Suhng Wook Kim,Jun Hyuk Kang,Ji Young Park,Yung-Kyun Noh,Cardiovascular Center Keywords: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetes, machine learning, prediction, big data"

The core concept of transfer learning involves leveraging insights and information from auxiliary datasets to enhance the analysis of the primary dataset of interest. In this paper, our focus is on datasets originating from distinct yet interconnected distributions. We assume that the training data conforms to a standard generalized linear model, while the testing data exhibit a connection to the training data based on a prior probability shift assumption. Ultimately, we discover that the two-sample conditional means are interrelated through an unknown, nondecreasing function. We integrate the power of generalized estimating equations with the shape-restricted score function, creating a robust framework for improved inference regarding the underlying parameters. We theoretically establish the asymptotic properties of our estimator and demonstrate, through simulation studies, that our method yields more accurate parameter estimates compared to those based solely on the testing or training data.

","Shape-restricted transfer learning analysis for generalized linear regression models Authors: Pengfei Li,Tao Yu,Chixiang Chen,Jing Qin Keywords: Estimating equation, Generalized linear model, Prior Probability shift, Shaperestricted inference, Transfer learning Introduction:
 In the era of big data and diverse sources of information, statistical transfer learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address challenges posed by data heterogeneity and limited sample sizes. Introduction:
 Traditional statistical methods often assume that the training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution , an assumption that may not hold true in many real-world scenarios. Introduction:
 The motivation behind statistical transfer learning stems from the recognition that data collected from one domain can contain valuable information benefiting the learning process in another domain . This is particularly relevant when the target domain has limited labeled data or exhibits different statistical properties compared to the source domain. Introduction:
 By harnessing the wealth of knowledge from related domains, statistical transfer learning offers a way to enhance predictive accuracy, generalization, and interpretability in various applications, such as the development of precision medicine , language recognition , medical diagnosis , and recommender systems . Introduction:
 The predictive accuracy of machine learning models is significantly impacted by the presence of data shift, which occurs when the distribution of the data used for model training differs substantially from the distribution of the data encountered during deployment. Introduction:
 This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical AI systems, where machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in discerning patterns from clinical data. Dataset shift can lead to severe consequences, adversely affecting model performance and patient outcomes in such systems. Introduction:
 The impact of dataset shift becomes notably apparent in the case of the sepsis-alerting model at the University of Michigan Hospital . Developed by Epic Systems, this model effectively identified potential sepsis cases using historical patient data. Introduction:
 However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the model's performance deteriorated due to shifts in patients' demographic characteristics and other relevant factors. This dataset shift fundamentally altered the relationship between fevers and bacterial sepsis, resulting in spurious alerting. Introduction:
 As a consequence, the hospital's clinical AI governing committee deactivated the model for patient safety reasons. Therefore, it is crucial to explore methods that can appropriately combine data information from similar studies when conducting statistical learning across various scientific fields, including economics, machine learning, distributed statistical inferences, and others. Introduction:
 Data shift can manifest in various forms. One extensively studied transfer learning problem involves binary classification within the framework of domain adaptation. In this scenario, the distributions of data pairs (X, Y ) are assumed to be drawn from related but distinct distributions defined on R p × {0, 1}. Introduction:
 For simplicity, we focus on two distributionsnamely, the training and testing distributions. In this framework, two general strategies are employed. The first strategy involves making no additional assumptions about the relationship between distributions but instead suggesting a measurement of the divergence of the distributions. Introduction:
 This measurement is then used to establish and quantify the effectiveness of the classification rules . The second strategy involves imposing structural assumptions between the training and testing distributions. Introduction:
 Common assumptions include covariate shift and label shift (or more generally, prior probability shift). The covariate shift refers to the change in the distribution of the covariates X in the training and testing data ."

 Machine learning modeling is an intelligent way to extract the hidden relationship among different variables in a dataset. It has been used as a decision-support system for prediction in different applications' domains such as healthcare, education and industry . Machine learning models can be classified into three main categories: (1) supervised learning, (2) unsupervised learning and (3) semi-supervised learning  (Figure  available at https:// github.com/Dr- . The objective of a machine learning classification model is to predict the class of a given input data . They are heavily used in healthcare for disease diagnosis and prognosis, fraud detection, drug efficiency and the development of a Machine learning for diabetes prediction nationwide prevention plan . Diabetes disease has attracted a lot of attention lately due to its proliferation and dangerous consequences that may lead to death. Diabetes prediction is a classification problem, where the input features variables are the risk factors , and the aim is to classify an individual, based on class labels, as diabetic or non-diabetic . Introduction:
 Few machine learning prediction frameworks have been proposed in the literature for healthcare . However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive framework in the literature which depicts the process of diabetes data analytics from domain understanding to model deployment. In this paper, we propose an intelligent diabetes mellitus prediction framework (IDMPF) using machine learning models, as support for allied health professionals, consisting of doctors, dieticians, medical technologists, therapists and pathologists, for better diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, for better patient care. The framework helps stakeholders, such as insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms and the government to put in place a preventive plan and an effective healthcare strategy. IDMPF is based on the principles of data analytic lifecycle . The proposed IDMPF is evaluated using the decision tree (DT)-based random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classification models, as they are the most used in the literature  from 2010 to 2019, as shown in Figure  (https://github.com/Dr-Leila-Ismail). Very few works compare RF and SVM . While , and  do not report on the number of observations in the considered dataset,  uses a dataset consisting of 2500 observations. They do not consider the impact of an imbalanced dataset on the prediction results. In this paper, we evaluate the models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and execution time using a dataset having 65,839 observations."

This paper aims to evaluate the effect of CL based pretraining on the performance of referable vs non referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We have developed a CL based framework with neural style transfer (NST) augmentation to produce models with better representations and initializations for the detection of DR in color fundus images. We compare our CL pretrained model performance with two state of the art baseline models pretrained with Imagenet weights. We further investigate the model performance with reduced labeled training data (down to 10 percent) to test the robustness of the model when trained with small, labeled datasets. The model is trained and validated on the EyePACS dataset and tested independently on clinical datasets from the University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC). Compared to baseline models, our CL pretrained FundusNet model had higher AUC (CI) values (0.91 (0.898 to 0.930) vs 0.80 (0.783 to 0.820) and 0.83 (0.801 to 0.853) on UIC data).

","and transferability of diabetic retinopathy classi cation models Authors: Minhaj Nur Alam (Corresponding Author),Rikiya Yamashita,Jennifer I Lim,Robison Vernon,Paul Chan,Joelle Hallak,Daniel Rubin Introduction:
 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major ocular manifestation of diabetes. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, it is estimated that by the year 2040, the number of diabetic patients will reach 642 million. Nearly 40-45% patients with diabetes are prone to vision impairment due DR, making the global estimate of DR patients nearly 224 million. DR can be initially asymptomatic at its nonproliferative stage (NPDR), which is characterized by the presence of micro-aneurysms. If not treated in a timely fashion, it can progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), leading to irreversible vision loss and blindness. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends that patients with the prevalent Type II diabetes should be screened every year after the initial diagnosis . However, studies show that less than 50% diabetic patients follow through and get their yearly screening, the rate being even lower (15-20%) in rural areas . Therefore, it is imperative to nd an e cient way to improve the treatment management for DR and enable mass screening, early onset detection, and clinical diagnostics. Introduction:
 In recent years, researchers have successfully demonstrated machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based algorithms for DR diagnosis and referrals. Especially, DL methodologies have facilitated feature extraction and DR classi cation with high accuracy, sensitivity, and speci city  using different imaging modalities such as fundus images, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) images. In general, such DL based DR classi cation pipelines require large, clean, diverse data, ground truth associated with the data, and a robust DL model (convolutional neural nets such as VGG16, ResNet, InceptionNet etc.). In case of referable vs non-referable DR classi cation, despite impressive performance showcased by these DL models, we can make two major observations: i) for wide-spread deployment, the DL models need to be more generalized, and ii) more data from different sub-populations can lead to better model training. However, this need to utilize larger, more diverse data also increases the need for ground truth generation and data labeling -which creates a large burden on clinicians. In this study, our focus is on reducing the burden of ground truth generation by developing more transferable DL models."

However, their predictive performance can vary across demographic groups, often due to the underrepresentation of historically marginalized populations in training datasets. The investigation reveals widespread sex- and age-related inequities in chronic disease datasets and their derived ML models. Thus, a novel analytical framework is introduced, combining systematic arbitrariness with traditional metrics like accuracy and data complexity. The analysis of data from over 25,000 individuals with chronic diseases revealed mild sex-related disparities, favoring predictive accuracy for males, and significant age-related differences, with better accuracy for younger patients. Notably, older patients showed inconsistent predictive accuracy across seven datasets, linked to higher data complexity and lower model performance. This highlights that representativeness in training data alone does not guarantee equitable outcomes, and model arbitrariness must be addressed before deploying models in clinical settings. ","Title: Disparate Model Performance and Stability in Machine Learning Clinical Support for Diabetes and Heart Diseases Authors: Ioannis Bilionis,Ricardo C Berrios,Luis Fernandez-Luque,Carlos Castillo Introduction:
 In the realm of biomedicine, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, particularly Machine Learning (ML) models, are used as clinical support tools to systematically discern patterns and interdependencies among factors and outcomes within large datasets. ML has the potential to enhance healthcare provision by complementing, rather than supplanting, clinical judgment. Introduction:
 It has demonstrated efficacy in the detection of skin cancer and diabetic retinopathy, among many other medical conditions . A paramount objective when deploying ML models is the assurance of health equity ; thus, researchers and practitioners typically aim at attaining uniform model efficacy across diverse patient demographics . Introduction:
 The academic literature recommends an array of analytical tools for detecting biases, e.g., determining statistical dependencies between model outcomes, model errors, and specific subgroups , particularly those experiencing both historical and ongoing discrimination. Introduction:
 Disparities detected in model performance are frequently attributed to deficiencies within the training datasets, typically lack of sufficient samples from those groups . Introduction:
 Algorithmic fairness, as a research field, studies how and to which extent algorithmic decision support systems can be free from discriminatory biases . Discrimination, in this context, means systematic disadvantages affecting socially salient groups . Introduction:
 These disadvantages arise from a complex combination of design choices made at different points in the construction of an ML processing pipeline. Discriminatory biases have been documented in basically all applications of ML and AI , including recruitment , machine translation  and face recognition , just to name a few. Introduction:
 In healthcare applications, prior research has identified algorithmic bias as a factor contributing to health disparities, highlighting the need for including Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) in ML to achieve health equity . Introduction:
 For instance, in computer vision applications for medical imaging, biased data has been found to be a source of disparities in algorithmic outcomes . Introduction:
 Differences in mortality prediction and X-ray diagnosis have been identified across racial/ethnic groups , including discrepancies in burn identification and diabetic retinopathy identification in dark-skinned versus lighter-skinned patients , and in an opioid misuse classifier, with more errors (false negatives) for dark-skinned patients . Introduction:
 In other cases, ML algorithms have predicted similar risk scores in both light-and dark-skinned patients, even though the dark-skinned patients had higher risk . There are many other examples, as this is an active research topic that to some extent is in its early stages . Introduction:
 An in-depth knowledge of an ML application and of its context should inform this analysis . In healthcare, the generalizability of AI algorithms across subgroups is critically dependent on training datasets, including factors such as representativeness, missing data, and outliers . Introduction:
 This suggests that some biases can be traced to datasets that underrepresent certain populations; using these unbalanced datasets as training data yields algorithmic models that exhibit systematically unbalanced errors . Introduction:
 In this context, the augmentation of the dataset with additional samples from the underrepresented group, which frequently corresponds to groups that are socioeconomically disadvantaged or medically underserved, has been empirically demonstrated to mitigate discrepancy in model accuracy. This is the case of the seminal ""Gender Shades"" study . Introduction:
 Similar results have been observed in the training set of a popular face detection benchmark dataset ."

A web-based comparative analysis of multiple machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Logistic Regression) is utilized in this paper, to assess their performances in recognizing reliable models for detecting diabetic disease. To see the effects of adding more features to the classification model, three performance measures were chosen: F1-Measure, Precision, and Accuracy. ","diabetics was applied to ANFIS with PCA in the exploration revealed in this work, and the most reliable learning approaches were assessed. On the diabetes sickness dataset, tests were embraced to analyze diabetes illness naturally, utilizing ANFIS and PCA. Related Work:
 Alghamdi et al  have applied AI techniques for anticipating occurrence diabetes, utilizing cardiopulmonary wellness information. Among the five characterization models utilized, the Random Under-Sampling procedure yielded improvement. The SMOTE approach, then again, exhibited an impressive improvement in the forecast capacity of all characterization models, as the rates used were step by step expanded.

 Faruque et al  have examined the early discovery of diabetes by thinking about a few gamble factors related with the disease. Foreseeing diabetic onset can be pretty much as straightforward as removing information from a genuine medical services dataset. To estimate diabetes mellitus, tests were directed on grown-up populace, utilizing four normal AI calculations SVM, NB, k-NN, and C4.5. The exhibition of the C4.5 is a lot better than the other AI calculations, for the arrangement of diabetic information. Soni et al have applied machine learning algorithm to design and implement diabetes prediction such as SVM, k-NN, RF, DT, LR, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.

 Kadhm et al  have proposed a fast and accurate diabetes prediction algorithm. For each PID dataset, the suggested system used 768 instances with 8 attributes. Furthermore, by partitioning the dataset into subsets, an optimal classification result was achieved. The suggested approach concentrated on the analysis and classification of characteristics. The results, of the studies, demonstrated the benefits of using the suggested system's algorithms, by achieving a greater categorization rate than competing systems. Tigga et al  have applied six different AI, and the outcomes were thought about. Tests were run on information gained on the web, and disconnected surveys, that included 18 diabetes-related inquiries. The exactness of RF is 94.10%, which is the best among the others. For the PIMA dataset, RF likewise, gives the greatest exactness. Each of the models showed great outcomes for greater accuracy, review responsiveness, etc. Related Work:
 Nnamokoetal  have collected a variety of factors that influence their potential to improve performance, particularly at the base level. The basis classifiers are chosen from five different machine learning algorithm families. As a result, each classifier would generate models based on its operational features. Despite the fact that none of them produced any major improvements at the base level, the sum of their unique biases contributed to a greater understanding of the classification problem at the ensemble level, ultimately leading to significant improvement. If such pre-processing experiments had been carried out, their outcomes might have been different. However, the findings of this study show that advances were achieved as a result of feature selection applied to heterogeneous base learners, rather than data pre-processing."

 The approach introduced in this paper aims at tackling the issue of over-confident predictions during model outcomes for the diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy. Identifying Diabetic Retinopathy is one healthcare application where machine learning has already shown significant potential. However, its applications in high-stakes healthcare choices must incorporate systematic uncertainty quantification and calibration for robust evaluation. By calibrating more generalized models, this framework also significantly aids in risk appraisal, lowering the possibility of potential misdiagnosis.

These examples highlight the importance of effective ethnoracial considerations in the development of clinical decision support tools. Ethnoracial Inequities in Diabetes AI:
 Despite the promise of AI, several factors predispose AI algorithms to negative biases. One limitation of AI models is the so-called distributional shift, where erroneous predictions result from a mismatch between the training population and the population on which the model is used. Such a mismatch can result from ""bias in the training set, change over time, or use of the system in a different population"" . Essentially, the robustness of AI algorithms is dependent upon the degree to which the training population represents the target population . In addition to the distributional shift phenomenon, the complexity and black-box nature of AI algorithms often obfuscates underlying errors or biases, specifically when compared to simpler rule-based systems . The detection of such biases in AI algorithms often requires careful consideration of model behavior in response to changing inputs . In the case of ethnoracial data, the omission of such information could result in a distributional shift based on ethnicity, race, or both in resultant models, which may be difficult for researchers to identify at the time of development. Ethnoracial Inequities in Diabetes AI:
 Given the clear ethnic and racial differences in diabetes biomarkers, prevalence, and outcomes , the inclusion of ethnoracial data is also likely to improve the accuracy of predictive models. The predictive value of race and XSL • FO RenderX ethnicity is well-documented in the literature, where they have been shown to independently predict health decline for adults living with diabetes . The impact of specific risk factors for T2D have even been shown to vary for both sex and race, with the most predictive factors being waist circumference in Black men, 2-hour glucose from an oral glucose tolerance test in Black women, and fasting glucose in both White men and White women . As a result of these associations between diabetes outcomes and ethnoracial information, the consideration of ethnoracial data is likely to enhance both the accuracy and generalizability of resultant AI-based diabetes tools."

Seeing as a model might excel for one metric and fail for another, this underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation. Employing multiple metrics ensures optimal operation and reduces the likelihood of blind spots. Model Validation:
 Once the final model has been trained, there are three approaches to choose from to apply the model to a new target dataset. The first approach is to test the model ""as-is"", implying that the ready-made model can be used in its original state without modifications . In the second scenario, the train data and the target data may have different characteristics, which may lead to a distribution shift. The type of distribution shift between the two datasets can occur for many reasons, including different mHealth devices used for data collection, environmental noise, and sampling bias . When this occurs, transfer learning can be used to finetune the ready-made model and update its weights to better suit the target dataset . In the third scenario, the target dataset may have different requirements than the original training dataset . As a result, the decision boundary of the classification model can be altered, such as optimizing the model for a sensitivity of 90% instead of accuracy. Whether testing the model as-is, employing transfer learning, or adjusting the decision boundary, these strategies offer flexibility in adapting the model to different settings and improving its performance for validation purposes. Model Reproducibility and Interpretability:
 Equally important as the model performance are the ML models' reproducibility and interpretability. Reproducibility is a core component for ensuring that a ML model can be validated and reused by clinical researchers. Technical reproducibility involves using the same computational procedures to produce consistent model outcomes. Statistical reproducibility ensures that the model demonstrates similar statistical performance across different subsets of data. Conceptual reproducibility refers to achieving consistent results under new conditions, such as data collected from different settings . Transparency regarding data quality, feature engineering and selection methods, the hyperparameters considered and selected, and the model validation protocol can help ease the ability of the scientific community to recreate the work in the published literature. Best practices for reproducibility include publishing the code on GitHub or by publishing FAIR metadata . Model Reproducibility and Interpretability:
 Given the potential clinical application of ML models, prior to modeling, researchers should determine the model's interpretability requirement. While ML models provide researchers with what was predicted, interpretability requires that the model can explain why it made the prediction . Interpretability enables us to understand the causal relationships between the data and the ML model's predictions. There are two situations in which the interpretability of a model is required: when an inaccurate prediction can have severe or even fatal consequences for the patients (such as a misclassified diagnosis ) and when the interpretability can be used to identify novel relationships between clinical factors and the predicted outcome (such as factors influencing treatment outcomes ). There can be two situations in which interpretability is not required: situations in which incorrect predictions do not have severe consequences (such as counting the number of coughs ) or situations in which the ML model has been sufficiently validated in real clinical applications, even if the predictions are not perfect . While black box models may offer more accurate predictions than an interpretable model, they only provide limited insight into how the predictions were made. Therefore, both interpretable and black box models have their respective merits."

As per the studies, early prediction of diabetes can lead to improved treatment to avoid further complications of the disease, and in order to do so efficiently, machine learning techniques are a great deal. In this study, various factors are taken into consideration, like blood pressure, pregnancy, glucose level, age, insulin, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function, which together can be useful to predict whether a person has a risk of developing diabetes or not and help society with the early diagnosis of diabetes. This model is trained using three main classification algorithms, namely support vector, random forest, and decision tree classifiers. The prediction results of each of the classifiers are summarized in this study, and the decision tree gives 78.89% accuracy. ","various applications, including healthcare .

 It is being increasingly used in various industries, from self-driving cars to healthcare. In the medical sector, large amounts of patient data are generated and processed in multiple ways. With machine learning, a prediction system has been developed that can identify multiple diseases simultaneously. LITERATURE REVIEw:
 Unlike most current systems that can only predict one disease at a time with low accuracy, this system aims to predict diabetes disease providing remarkable efficiency and possibly more in near future. By entering several disease related parameters, the system can output whether the user has the disease or not. LITERATURE REVIEw:
 This system has the potential to benefit many people by allowing for the monitoring of their condition and taking the necessary actions to lengthen their life . LITERATURE REVIEw:
 Using Machine Learning approaches to discover diabetes mellitus has proven to be a promising approach to predict and detect the disease. The project's motive is to explore and understand the utilisation of various Machine Learning approaches such as 'Decision Trees', 'Logistic Regression', and 'Support Vector Machines' in diabetes prediction. LITERATURE REVIEw:
 The findings of the project suggest that Machine Learning Algorithms can nicely forecast the occurrence of diabetes depending upon different features such as age, BMI, and glucose levels. The Bayesian model, in particular, has demonstrated high accuracy in detecting diabetes and its associated risk factors. LITERATURE REVIEw:
 However, the project also encountered some problems, including the need for a larger and more diverse dataset for better model performance, as well as the challenges of interpreting the models' predictions and features importance. Future research could address these issues by incorporating more data sources and using advanced visualisation techniques. LITERATURE REVIEw:
 Thus, the use of machine learning models, including Bayesian models, can improve diabetes diagnosis and early intervention. As technology advances, we can expect more sophisticated algorithms and techniques to enable healthcare providers to make more informed decisions and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Another factor is that, given the data at hand: diabetic_data_4F_2_Digest_Resp, if the accuracy of our developed ensemble machine learning model was high, perhaps more at-risk patients could have been correctly identified. CONCLUSIONS and FUTURE WORKS:
 In this paper, we investigated the impact of salient features in the diagnosis of diabetes cases and identified an optimal number of selected features. Various feature selection methods were used to identify the most important features that may effectively separate the two classes. Among the three different feature selection techniques experimented with, RF appeared to be the best strategy to generate important features from the dataset. The prediction models were then created using the selected features. Among the studied models for diabetes diagnosis, ensemble models outperformed the individual ones in terms of overall performance. We figured out that we could obtain the best diagnosis performance using only a minimum of 18 features. Then, we presented interpretation of the best performing model output using SHAP analysis. Furthermore, the relationship between diabetes and a few possible related diseases has been investigated, and a few ensemble machine learning models have been designed to diagnose these diseases. The accuracy for these models reached 83.24%, and it could have been better if we had more data, but our findings agreed with most of the state-of-the-art research. Moreover, based on our provided machine learning prediction models' interpretations, we emphasized the need to have diabetes patients clinically checked for those expected related diseases, especially circulatory system diseases, as a method of early intervention of any life-threatening situations. CONCLUSIONS and FUTURE WORKS:
 We believe that our approach can help patients, clinicians, and doctors gain useful insight into the likelihood of developing diabetes or other related diseases in the future, allowing them to adopt preventative actions. Furthermore, doctors and diabetes educators can use our models as a tool to help them make sound clinical decisions for their patients and help them live better lives. Finally, for future work, data from other countries could help other researchers to generalize our strategy, the thing that eventually could have substantial ramifications for the healthcare sector. database patient records,‖ BioMed Research International, vol. 2014, Article ID 781670, 11 pages, 2014."

Objective To develop and validate a population-level machine learning model for predicting type 2 diabetes 5 years before diabetes onset using administrative health data. Design, Setting, and Participants This decision analytical model study used linked administrative health data from the diverse, single-payer health system in Ontario, Canada, between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2016. A gradient boosting decision tree model was trained on data from 1 657 395 patients, validated on 243 442 patients, and tested on 236 506 patients. Costs associated with each patient were estimated using a validated costing algorithm. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2016. Exposures A random sample of 2 137 343 residents of Ontario without type 2 diabetes was obtained at study start time. More than 300 features from data sets capturing demographic information, laboratory measurements, drug benefits, health care system interactions, social determinants of health, and ambulatory care and hospitalization records were compiled over 2-year patient medical histories to generate quarterly predictions. Main Outcomes and Measures Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic, and calibration was assessed visually using calibration plots. Feature contribution was assessed with Shapley values. Costs were estimated in 2020 US dollars. Results This study trained a gradient boosting decision tree model on data from 1 657 395 patients (12 900 257 instances; 6 666 662 women [51.7%]). The developed model achieved a test area under the curve of 80.26 (range, 80.21-80.29), demonstrated good calibration, and was robust to sex, immigration status, area-level marginalization with regard to material deprivation and race/ethnicity, and low contact with the health care system. The top 5% of patients predicted as high risk by the model represented 26% of the total annual diabetes cost in Ontario. Conclusions and Relevance In this decision analytical model study, a machine learning model approach accurately predicted the incidence of diabetes in the population using routinely collected health administrative data. These results suggest that the model could be used to inform decision-making for population health planning and diabetes prevention.","measures that consider those at greatest risk, including from a socioeconomic perspective. Because our machine learning model included social determinants of health that are known to contribute to diabetes risk, our population-wide approach to risk assessment may represent a tool for addressing health disparities. Strengths and Limitations:
 Our study approach had several strengths. Owing to the nature of administrative data, such an approach could be applied to other chronic diseases. In 2009, 24.3% of Ontarians were found to be affected by multiple comorbidities.  Accurately forecasting other prominent chronic conditions, such as hypertension, could lead to potential considerable reductions in health care costs while also improving the health and well-being of the population. Similar work to create risk prediction models has been done in a primary prevention cohort from New Zealand to determine 5-year cardiovascular disease risk, and research from the UK reinforces that reducing cardiovascular event risk by even 1% would result in both large cost savings and improved population health.  Moreover, we included a detailed calibration assessment, both overall and within key population subgroups, which suggests that our model did not only have strong discrimination but was well calibrated in a diverse population.  Finally, the choice of using a gradient boosting machine model permitted the usage of Shapley values to enhance explainability.  Our proposed approach also had some important limitations. First, there was the potential for misclassification of patients with type 1 diabetes given limitations with the algorithm used in label construction of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  Of the roughly 2% to 3% of individuals aged 20 years or younger who tested positive for diabetes, we are uncertain how many were actually diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. However, we chose not to exclude younger patients in our cohort owing to the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in youths and young adults.  Second, the input administrative health data were highly heterogeneous: only 23.4% of patients had at least 1 laboratory value, and only the patients older than 65 years had a prescription history. We believe that more consistency and fewer missing values in the input data would improve the model's discrimination. Third, administrative data often does not capture certain features known to be highly predictive of diabetes onset, such as body mass index; however, we achieved competitive performance when our machine learning model was compared to those trained on richer sources of data while allowing for applicability at the population level. Fourth, although we can interpret the model's decisions and the way it splits variables to separate patients into risk score categories, the model strictly captured correlations in the data and not causal pathways. Finally, our model would need to be further validated through prospective studies before deployment. Conclusions:
 In this decision analytical model study, we developed and validated a population-level machine learning model to predict the incidence of type 2 diabetes 5 years ahead in a large, contemporary cohort from Ontario, Canada's single-payer health system. Study results suggest that our model had strong discrimination and was robust in calibration across several subgroups, including sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity marginalization, and material deprivation marginalization. Conclusions:
 Following external and prospective validation, our findings suggest that administrative health data and machine learning may be leveraged for the continuous risk assessment and cost-effective targeting of prevention efforts of type 2 diabetes at the population level with a focus on health equity."

This phenomenon, known as dataset shift, can reduce ML model performance in sudden and significant ways. How can clinicians appraise machine learning solutions?:
 Finally, ML's ability to learn non-linear relationships among a wide range of predictors often contributes to high empirical performance but the inability to discern how and why certain predictions are made. Researchers have thus developed both ML models that are inherently ""interpretable"" as well as methods to create post hoc ""explanations"" of this ""black box"" model behaviour. While interpretability and explainability are areas of active debate, explainability methods may be more appropriate during the model development stage to ensure models are generally behaving appropriately as opposed to explaining individual predictions at the time of inference. For example, Singh et al. use Shapley values to confirm that their model to automate the ordering of diagnostic tests at triage for paediatric patients was leveraging predictors in intuitive and defensible ways (e.g., the model associated concern for appendicitis with the need to order an abdominal ultrasound) . While explainability and interpretability can facilitate building trust in ML models, clinicians should not value them over robust, empirical evidence of clinical benefit or harm from prospective, external validation studies and randomized trials. What is needed to translate machine learning solutions into clinical practice?:
 Prior to the widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs), traditional clinical prediction models were commonly developed using data abstracted from paper charts or collected prospectively. The time-consuming nature of this process often resulted in models containing a handful of predictors that were causally associated with an outcome of interest. Resulting models were then implemented as nomograms or points-based risk scores where clinicians could quickly determine a given patient's likelihood of having a condition (diagnostic models) or experiencing an outcome of interest (prognostic models, e.g., MEWS for clinical deterioration, Canadian Syncope Risk Score)."

Thanks so much to my classmate Jeremy Kaplan, as we turned a class project from Dr. Rao's class into a toolbox and a paper. Chapter 1 Introduction:
 Machine learning models have rapidly grown in popularity, across many fields, as algorithms and computational power become more easily accessible. Many clinical researchers have used models like neural networks, random forests, or support vector machines, to study disease processes and predict prognosis. Chapter 1 Introduction:
 However, while the accessibility and abundance of machine learning projects has increased, there are still relatively few machine learning systems deployed in real world clinical settings. This gap between machine learning research and clinical deployment is known as the implementation gap. Chapter 1 Introduction:
 Seneviratne et al. discuss a few reasons for this gap, including clinical actionability, patient safety, and cost utility. Patient safety can only be adequately addressed through rigorous testing of machine learning systems, and by working with clinicians to create safeguards and safety systems. Chapter 1 Introduction:
 This dissertation approaches the well-studied space of glioma magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate and interrogate models across multiple axes. These themes are explored across four manuscripts corresponding to chapters 2, 4, 6, and 8 (the first three manuscripts have been published as of November 2022). Chapter 1 Introduction:
 Algorithmic pipelines can be broken down into three main components: data, model, and inference. Data means the inputs the system uses to make a prediction, which our context includes medical imaging, laboratory values, genetic markers, and clinical outcomes. Chapter 1 Introduction:
 The model refers to the algorithm and complex functions that turn those imaging data, and other clinical biomarkers into prediction scores. Inference refers to the logical conclusions about the underlying process that are supported by the model's prediction scores. Chapter 1 Introduction:
 Any part of this generalized pipeline can have problems, and the tools needed for evaluating these components can be quite different. Data:
 Examples of problems with data are numerous, and can be broadly summarized with the saying, ""Garbage in, garbage out."" If data used to train a model are flawed, the model will reflect those flaws, and be less accurate. Data:
 For example, the use of health billing data for research, can raise issues, since the data was not originally coded for epidemiological research. Spurious correlations can occur like comorbidities (e.g. Data:
 diabetes) that can appear protective because they are often not recorded properly in chronically ill patients who have complex or lengthy hospitalizations. . Non-clinical machine learning practitioners need to communicate with clinicians to understand the clinical data they use, or these kinds of issues will arise. Data:
 But more insidious than just incorrect answers, a biased dataset will entrench biased patterns, such as how Obermeyer et al found health system risk prediction algorithms gave the same risk prediction score to Black patients who were sicker than White patients. Data:
 The algorithm had been based on health costs as a proxy for patient health, and because less money is spent on Black patients, the algorithm inherited that bias. Data:

The high stakes and often unintuitive nature of clinical data make effective collaboration between clinicians and ML researchers one of the most important aspects of working in this interdisciplinary space. However, there are few resources codifying best practices for collaboration on Clinical ML projects. In this paper, we interviewed 18 experts in the Clinical ML field and distilled their advice and experiences into a list of questions (a Clinical Collabsheet) ML scientists and clinicians can use to promote effective discussion when working on a new project.

If this is known early on, access to GPUs within a secure environment can be purchased or acquired while other aspects of the project (REB/IRB approval, data access, preprocessing, etc) are in progress. Data Access and Privacy:
 1. Data Storage: Where will the data live? Does the IRB/REB allow moving the data? If that's not possible, what is the process to analyze it in place? Data Access and Privacy:
 2. Computing Resources: Are the computing available resources sufficient for this analysis? (i.e. What's needed? What's available?) Data Access and Privacy:
 3. Integration Requirements: What system/performance requirements will be needed for a deployed environment? (e.g. real-time access to data vs daily snapshots; queries to avoid overloading the database; etc) 4. Deployment: How will the code run on the system? (e.g. will the project run in python on the hospital IT infrastructure via docker? will the model parameters need to be hard-coded into the EHR with the MUMPS language? etc) 5. Replication Considerations: Once the project is over, how can we recreate the cohort to replicate the results as a starting point for future projects? (e.g. a stable query to reproduce the same cohort, if need be) Safety and Fairness:
 Clinical ML is high-risk and has a long tail of dangerous outliers. This section is concerned with the possibility of algorithmic harm, especially at scale. Clinical ML Safety can apply to any group that appears to be at risk for inadvertent algorithmic harm (e.g. patients with a rare breast cancer pathology). Equity and fairness considerations arise when algorithmic tools run the risk of exacerbating historical disadvantages for groups. Suresh and Guttag (2019) outline a framework of ways ML bias can arise, including: Safety and Fairness:
 • representation bias (e.g. if a dataset was not trained on Hispanic populations) Safety and Fairness:
 • historical bias (e.g. social determinants of health make some populations less healthy) Safety and Fairness:
 • measurement bias (e.g. rural clinics have worse measurement tools than academic medical centers) Safety and Fairness:
 • aggregation bias (one-size-fits-all model on a heterogeneous population) Safety and Fairness:
 • evaluation bias (e.g. label is a bad proxy for success) Safety and Fairness:

III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP:
 promising with their results, it is still a challenge to practice these methods in real-time for clinical diagnosis. The main reason is that AI needs a large amount of data to work with, and this requires time. In the case of AI, this is called data transfer learning. And it means that you need a large amount of labeled data to train your algorithm with. Moreover, the results may again vary based on the data collected from a geographic location such as Asia Pacific, USA, and European regions. III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP:
 The datasets available on open-source platforms are outdated and don't meet the expected results as the prediction needs to be dynamic, which means based on the patient's current reports. Also, the results will vary based on the top features or attributes selected during the process of feature selection. III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP:
 The challenge of building a machine learning model is that it requires extensive data, which is often not available in the medical field. Therefore, there are limitations to building a model based on the available data. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Our research presents compelling results on the detection of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using feature selection algorithms. Through the utilization of carefully curated datasets, we employed various algorithms to assess the probability of individuals having T2D. The evaluation of our results was based on performance metrics such as prediction, F1-score, recall, and accuracy, which are presented in Table . IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

The Confusion Matrix visually represents the superior performance of our approach, clearly demonstrating the enhanced accuracy obtained through our methodology. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Of particular interest is the remarkable performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, outperforming other algorithms examined in our study. This discovery holds great promise for the healthcare industry, as our proposed model proves to be cost-effective and efficient in terms of implementation time. Unlike traditional diagnostic tests such as Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), our model eliminates the need for expensive lab reagents and specialized skills. This breakthrough paves the way for early detection of diabetes, especially in remote areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
 Looking ahead, the integration of 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies offers even more potential for improving healthcare outcomes. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, the latency at the edge can be significantly reduced, enabling real-time data analysis and decision-making.

Diabetes is just one of several diseases for which machine learning techniques can be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment procedures. Methodology: In this paper, we propose a new approach for boosting the classification of diabetes based on a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm.

The selected features are then classified using a random forest classifier with its parameters optimized using the proposed DBERDTO. Results: The proposed methodology is evaluated and compared with recent optimization methods and machine learning models to prove its efficiency and superiority. The overall accuracy of diabetes classification achieved by the proposed approach is 98.6%. On the other hand, statistical tests have been conducted to assess the significance and the statistical difference of the proposed approach based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

 Hyperglycemia due to abnormalities in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both characterize the metabolic condition known as diabetes mellitus (DM). Long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of multiple organs, including the heart, eyes, kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves, can be attributed to the chronic hyperglycemia that is associated with DM . Diabetes mellitus (DM) is divided into three subtypes based on its etiology and clinical presentation: type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and gestational diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed, typically as a result of a cellular-mediated autoimmune response, leading to an utter lack of insulin. Type 2 diabetes is brought on by insulin resistance and a little insulin shortage. Gestational diabetes, often known as pregnancy-onset diabetes, is characterized by glucose intolerance of varied degrees . The vast majority of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes. Although type 2 diabetes is more common in people over 40, it can also affect those of any age. The symptoms of this type may not manifest for years, and many individuals are diagnosed by chance when they seek care for unrelated issues. Patients with T2DM are not insulin-dependent, but they may require insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia if it cannot be achieved via diet alone or with oral hypoglycemic medications . Introduction:
 The causes of type 2 diabetes are varied and convoluted. Many factors increase or decrease the likelihood of contracting the disease, although not all of them are direct causes. These factors may be hereditary, demographic (such as age), or behavioral (food, smoking, obesity, and lack of exercise). Behavioral risk factors are sometimes referred to as ""modifiable"" risk factors  since they can be altered or improved upon. More than 460 million individuals worldwide were diagnosed with diabetes in 2019, and that number is anticipated to rise to 578 million by 2030 and 700 million by 2045, as reported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) . The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to rise, making it one of the most concerning NCDs. Introduction:
 To predict the future incidence and global prevalence of diabetes, numerous studies over the past two decades have used various data sets and analytical methodologies . Accurate forecasts of the future burden of diabetes are vital for health policy planning and establishing the costs of managing the condition . Disease prediction and diagnosis for pandemic chronic diseases such as diabetes are two areas where machine learning algorithms have lately seen extensive application in public health. Machine learning techniques examine historical patterns in data to foretell what will happen in the future. Algorithms in machine learning provide data modeling, analysis, and visualization mention . Several machine learning techniques have been utilized in diabetes modeling studies, including support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision trees (DTs) . Despite the importance of studying diabetes prevalence trends and predicting future burdens using risk factors in specific populations, little work has been done to adopt machine learning classification methods."

 Work Package 2: Obtaining appropriate samples of data. It is essential to have a clear understanding of the goals we have set for our model and what we hope to accomplish with it. This will help us figure out what kind of information we need to gather and how much of it we will need. The data of normal people has been taken into consideration, but the purity of the data is the most important aspect. 2.3:
 Work Package 3: Development The relevant data sources should be successfully identified. Develop a way to organize the data so that it can be used to teach a machine learning model. o 2.3:
 Cleaning and pre-processing the data to remove any errors or inconsistencies is important, as is formatting the data so that it is easy to use for training and testing the model. 2.5:
 Work Package 5: Training and evaluation of the model After all the data has been collected and all the necessary steps have been taken, it is used in several ways to train a machine-learning model. The model can be made more accurate by using the testing set to see how well it works and then making any changes that are needed. Professional, Legal and Ethical Issueus:
 Bias in the data: The accuracy of machine learning models is directly proportional to the quality of the data they are trained on. If the data that is used to train the model has a bias, then it is probable that the model will also have a bias. It is essential to give due consideration to the possible sources of bias in the data and to take measures to eliminate or reduce those sources. Professional, Legal and Ethical Issueus:
  Bias in algorithms: Machine learning algorithms may also be prejudiced, which can lead to erroneous or unjust findings. This can be prevented by avoiding certain practices. It is essential to conduct a thorough analysis of the performance of the model to check that it does not include any biases and to take measures to compensate for any biases that may be discovered.  Transparency: It is necessary to be upfront about the methods and data used to construct the model, as well as the limits of the model and its possible influence on individuals. It is also important to be transparent about the constraints of the model itself. Relevance to Beneficaries:
 Using machine learning to make a diabetes prediction model can be helpful for people who may be at risk of getting diabetes because it can help them take steps to prevent or manage the disease. For example, if the prediction model can accurately detect people who are likely to get diabetes, those people may be able to take steps to lower their chance of developing the disease, such as making changes to their lifestyle (like improving their diet and getting more exercise) or seeing a doctor. Also, if the prediction model can accurately predict which people are most likely to get diabetes, it may be helpful for healthcare providers to use the model to target interventions for those people. This could make diabetes prevention and management efforts more effective."

This may be due to the separate development of research in the computational/data versus social and health sciences as well as a lack of accessible overviews and adequate training in ML techniques for non data science researchers. This paper provides a meta-mapping of research questions in the social and health sciences to appropriate ML approaches, by incorporating the necessary requirements to statistical analysis in these disciplines. We map the established classification into description, prediction, and causal inference to common research goals, such as estimating prevalence of adverse health or social outcomes, predicting the risk of an event, and identifying risk factors or causes of adverse outcomes. This meta-mapping aims at overcoming disciplinary barriers and starting a fluid dialogue between researchers from the social and health sciences and methodologically trained researchers. Such mapping may also help to fully exploit the benefits of ML while considering domain-specific aspects relevant to the social and health sciences, and hopefully contribute to the acceleration of the uptake of ML applications to advance both basic and applied social and health sciences research.","contributions. Introduction: Figure . Typical relationship between model error and complexity. General points: In the following, we will refer to relevant concepts when applying ML in the social and health sciences, specifically, interpretability, fairness, and generalizability. Interpretability / explainability and visualization:
 Interpretable ML means to extract relevant knowledge from ML models, i.e. able to feed into the domain knowledge of a discipline, characterized by predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience . Interpretability is important in high-stake decisions, such as clinical decision making. Here new developments exist to increase acceptance, e.g. the symbolic metamodeling framework for interpreting predictions by converting ""black-box"" models into ""whitebox"" functions that are understandable to humans . Others have however suggested that the use of separate, explainable, models could be problematic in applications as there is still limited transparency for the users of the ML models . Interpretability / explainability and visualization:
 Interpretability is in practice often linked with the possibility to visualize the estimated or discovered relationships among variables. Summary packages intended to give a user-friendly set of possibilities to increase (post-hoc) interpretability have been developed, e.g. iml . To increase interpretability, bi-variate and higher-order data associations with possible non-linear patterns or missing data that are not at random, as well predictions can be visualized e.g. with partial dependence plots , SHAP plots , or Individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots, a newer and less well-known adaptation of partial dependence plots (P. . Fairness:
 A relevant notion in the health and social sciences is the idea of the ML algorithm to decide ""fairly"", i.e. will not discriminate against certain social or minority groups. Here, particularly in the application of ML in high-stake decision making such as predicting recidivism, predictive model accuracy needs to be balanced against the model treating all social groups equally, i.e. the ML model resulting in all social groups having equal probability of receiving a desirable outcome. We refer to other literature for considerations regarding fairness in ML at large  and ethics in ML in the human and social sciences . Importantly, health equity efforts can be undermined by structural discrimination/racism possibly implemented in ML diagnosis or decision-making . Outside the scope of our review, it is critical to realize that fairness is not just important in application of algorithms, but in the full arc of the research process . Generalizability or external validity:
 The importance of generalizability of external validity is not limited to ML approaches: Across research designs as well as across stages of data collection, we need to consider biases that could harm generalizability, as it is desired that findings have validity beyond the dataset in which they were discovered. In the context of ML, it is important to mention the risk of overfitting, i.e. to improve model accuracy within the dataset by risking model performance in a new dataset. An example of how differences in recruitment in cohort studies can result in differential performance of ML algorithms is . And, similar to more traditional analyses, triangulation of methods is recommended . While in the past it has been stated that a lot of 'black art' necessary to successfully implement ML in research , we stress the importance of documenting all decisions in the statistical analysis to the details (e.g. specifying seed of random number) to ensure scientific findings are replicable."

Physists may help with theory, such as for nuclear medicine. Engineers with machineries, such as dialysis machine. Mathematicians with models, such as pharmacokinetics. And computer scientists with codes such as bioinformatics. Method: We have used TensorFlow.js for modeling using neural networks biomedical datasets from Kaggle. We have modeled three datasets: diabetes detection, surgery complications, and heart failure. We have used Angular coded in TypeScript for the implementation of the models. Using TensorFlow.js, we have built Multilayer Perceptrons (MPLs) for modelling our datasets. We have employed the training and the validation curves to make sure the model learnt, and we have used accuracy as a measure of goodness of each model. Results and discussion: We have built a couple of examples using TensorFlow.js as machine learning platform. Even though python and R are dominant at the moment, JavaScript and derivatives are growing fast, offering basically the same performance, and some extra features associated with JavaScript. Kaggle, the public platform from where we downloaded our datasets, offers a huge amount of datasets for biomedical cases, thus, the reader can easily test what we have discussed, using the same codes, with minor chances, on any case they may be interested in. We were able to find 92% of accuracy for diabetes detection, 100% for surgery complications, and 70% for heart failure. The possibilities are unlimited, and we believe that it is a nice option for researchers aiming at web applications, especially, focused on medicine.","Kahneman and colleagues highlight, believe they understand how they decide, and get overconfident. It is not unknown about medical errors in diagnosis, and some areas of medicine may have a strong variation in the same diagnosis, coming from different professionals. Results and Discussion:
 Machine learning, when make mistakes, it is easily traceable, and enhanced. Even though we do not understand precisely how those models learn, we do understand the big picture. This is important to know when we are talking about models being used, and continuously enhanced based on their misdiagnosis. Once they learn, it does not happen again. Machine intelligence is easily repeatable, transferable and reliable once they are properly designed. Mathematical models applied to medicine:
 We have essentially two big groups of models applied to medicine: white box and black models. The former focus on details, whereas the latter on the dataset. Mathematical models applied to medicine:
 Black box models are closer to how humans think, and decide. A goalkeeper can predict where the ball will most likely be, based on several cues/inputs, but he cannot explain it details. You do not need to know all the physics from the ball to defend your goal. Machine learning is a black box model, and that is why they are so interesting to medicine. When we predict diabetes from a couple of features, it does not mean we understand the dynamics of diabetes, work done by white box models . Mathematical models applied to medicine:
 Most of the models in medicine, the ones called white box models, are complex, but not complex enough for reliable applications. Machine learning models, even though may get it right, are not explainable, they are just numbers that change during the learning process. Transfer learning is a set of numbers, which is used on another problem: knowledge from a set of images become a set of values on parameters called learning weights. They are just matrix multiplications and tensors manipulations. Different from humans when properly trained can explain their thinking in equations and theories, machine learning just do it right, but does not provide the rules explicitly. Diabetes detection:
 Diabetes is an interesting case for our discussion, it has been widely explored from both perspectives, as machine learning based models ), and white box models . Diabetes detection:
 On this section, we shall consider three possible models for diabetes detection using the same dataset, and model. The first model has six features, the second just one, and the last one has three features. The features are chosen from the same set of features. Diabetes detection:
 Always keep in mind that our goal is not comparing results or competing with third-party results presented, they are presented for enriching the discussions. Our goal here is showcasing TensorFlow.js, and supporting on spreading the word regarding this tools for creating advanced machine learning models. Years ago, those models would require either a strong expertise in programming and machine learning, or/and an expensive-paid software (e.g., Matlab). model 1: predicting with six features:
 We should always start with the simplest model, nonetheless, we shall start with the almost-full feature model. We are going to use the following features (table 1), six out of seven available features."

"Globalizing Fairness Attributes in Machine Learning: A Case Study on
  Health in Africa","https://scispace.com/paper/globalizing-fairness-attributes-in-machine-learning-a-case-2of6txdx","2023","Posted Content","","","10.48550/arxiv.2304.02190","https://scispace.com/pdf/globalizing-fairness-attributes-in-machine-learning-a-case-2of6txdx.pdf","With growing machine learning (ML) applications in healthcare, there have been calls for fairness in ML to understand and mitigate ethical concerns these systems may pose. Fairness has implications for global health in Africa, which already has inequitable power imbalances between the Global North and South. This paper seeks to explore fairness for global health, with Africa as a case study. We propose fairness attributes for consideration in the African context and delineate where they may come into play in different ML-enabled medical modalities. This work serves as a basis and call for action for furthering research into fairness in global health. ","governance, etc) to define relevant fairness desiderata in accordance with local laws and beliefs. An interdisciplinary approach at this stage is particularly important to avoid potential issues around competing definitions of fairness and purely mathematical formulations that lead to unintended performance degradation for all groups . Implications for machine learning and research opportunities:
 Practical fairness considerations: Further studies in the algorithmic fairness field have high-lighted the different ways in which bias can manifest in each step of the ML development pipeline namely during (1) problem selection, (2) data collection and processing, (3) algorithm development and evaluation and (4) post deployment considerations . A plethora of debiasing approaches have been proposed in the literature to tackle potential biased during steps (3) through (5) . In addition to better understanding how these mitigation strategies should be adapted to account for varying fairness attributes specific to LMICs, a particular hindrance to the application of machine learning techniques to the health domain in Africa resides in the problem formulation, collection and utilization of data . Below, we highlight examples of these challenges and important fairness considerations when using machine learning tools in Africa. Implications for machine learning and research opportunities:
 • problem selection: As noted in , biases stemming from unaligned incentives by external organizations can severely affect, for example, which diseases are studied. This has a trickling effect in terms of which data is collected regardless of relevance to the local population. It is particularly important at this step to consider the potential biases of stakeholders and ensure affected communities are included in the decision making step. Implications for machine learning and research opportunities:
 • scarcity of digitalized health records: patients health records remain predominantly paperbased due to a lack of infrastructure and computer resources to keep digital copies. This phenomenon is exacerbated in rural areas leading to further inequalities. Awareness of the crucial role of having electronic records in order to utilize machine learning tools ushers in new proposals to digitalize existing handwritten data. Challenging fairness problems in this step include how to develop automated tools that can reliably process underserved African languages as well as how to ensure that such efforts are equally distributed across regions. Implications for machine learning and research opportunities:
 • prevalence of survey data: most application of machine learning to health remain tied to data collected in clinical settings . In the African context, the prevalence of self-reported survey data introduces a number of biases including unbalanced representation of groups based on who answers the survey and potentially incorrect self-reported information about a responder's attributes. Application of machine learning methods to such data modality and how to account for measurement biases remain an underexplored area of research. Implications for machine learning and research opportunities:
 Caution around using pretrained models: Given the scarcity of readily available large training datasets from Africa, a common approach consist of finetuning large pretrained models to downstream tasks. This approach is particularly tempting as it allows to harness the power of large models whose training requires considerable resources and infrastructure within more resource-constrained environments. However, there are several pitfalls in this approach that could lead to unintended biases in the final model."

Therefore, we proposed to analyze and provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of diabetes screening scores for risk assessment and prediction in five populations: the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, US-PIMA Indian, and Trinidadian populations, utilizing statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. Additionally, due to the present COVID-19 epidemic, it is necessary to investigate how diabetes and COVID-19 are related to one another. Thus, by using a sample of the Korean population, the interrelationship between diabetes and COVID-19 was further investigated. The results revealed that by using a statistical method, the optimal cut points among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, US-PIMA Indian, and Trinidadian populations were 6.205 mmol/L (FPG), 5.523 mmol/L (FPG), and 5.375% (HbA1c), 150.50–106.50 mg/dL (FBS), 123.50 mg/dL (2hPG), and 107.50 mg/dL (FBG), respectively, with AUC scores of 0.97, 0.80, 0.78, 0.85, 0.79, and 0.905. The results also confirmed that diabetes has a significant relationship with COVID-19 in the Korean population (p-value 0.001), with an adjusted OR of 1.21.

By conducting this ML-based prediction methods analysis, the information of the best model for predicting diabetes was revealed, as well as the information regarding the most suitable model for real-world healthcare data and requirements. Conclusions:
 Even though the diabetes screening scores showed robust results in revealing risk factors, determining cut points, and assessing the risk of diabetes or predicting diabetes, this study has limitations that should be noted. The first limitation of this study is that we generalized some multiple-categorical variables in the dataset into binary categorical variables, so it may result in different findings. For example, we categorized the smoking variable into two categories: smoking and not smoking, where there are four levels of smoking. Thus, it may result in different findings, and analysis of using multiple categories could be investigated in future work. The second limitation is that this study only used one dataset to investigate the interrelationship between diabetes and COVID-19. To reveal a strong and robust interrelationship between diabetes and COVID-19, the utilization of numerous datasets is recommended, especially datasets across various nations. Therefore, in future work, the utilization of numerous datasets in order to investigate and reveal a strong interrelationship between diabetes and COVID-19 will be challenging."

Diabetes is a chronic disorder. With preventive treatment, outcomes may be improved through early prediction of diabetes-related hospitalisation using data-driven algorithms. Here, we examine recent advances in deep learning methods for anticipating readmissions and unexpected hospital stays in adult patients with diabetes. Firstly, we present an overview of the main factors that indicate the need for hospitalisation due to diabetic complications. The research on hospitalisation risk prediction using structured health data, such as demographics, prescriptions, test results, etc., using conventional machine learning techniques is then summarised. Using data from insurance claims and electronic health records, we then examine current research that has used deep learning models. It is emphasised that longitudinal data can be included using recurrent neural networks. Model architectures, training methods, and important data modalities are covered. The assessment also addresses deployment difficulty and the model's performance assessment on real-world datasets. Ultimately, potential paths forward include hybrid models that integrate data diversity, explainable predictions, and clinical knowledge. In order to provide evidence-based predictions of the risk of hospitalisation and readmission for diabetes patients, we examine the potential and constraints of recently developed deep learning algorithms in this review. ","of generative deep learning has produced potent new methods for picture creation, manipulation, and restoration in the field of image processing. However, there are still issues with regulating the results, assessing the accuracy of the models, and increasing generation variety and resolution. Transfer Learning:
 For patients with diabetic retinopathy, generative AI models are helpful in forecasting the likelihood of hospitalization . In order to supplement the restricted real-world datasets, generative AI models may generate vast volumes of realistic synthetic patient data. Transfer Learning:
 The ability to create fresh instances with a distribution similar to that of actual EHRs is possessed by variational autoencoders (VAEs) [69]and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The robustness, generalisation, and class imbalance of the model are all enhanced with augmented data. Transfer Learning:
 With realistic temporal patterns and typical progressions leading to hospitalisation episodes, GANs are able to create longitudinal EHRs. When disease trajectories and correlations are appropriately set, VAEs can sample novel complication routes and comorbidity profiles. Transfer Learning:
 Training on more complex profile combinations that aren't fully present in the small amount of seen data is made possible by this. Due to the lack of need for genuine sensitive records, synthetic data production can assist in addressing data privacy restrictions. Transfer Learning:
 Facilitates the creation of customised datasets that align with the features of the population to train specialised models . In general, generative models make it possible to more successfully use patterns from small datasets to forecast the likelihood of hospitalisation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Transfer Learning:
 The calibre and variety of the real data used to create generative models, however, continues to have a significant impact on model performance. Transfer Learning:
 Reinforcement learning can predict early hospitalization of diabetes patients by learning the best treatment plans, stratifying patient risk levels, modeling illness progression dynamics, customizing guidelines, and retraining behavior models. These methods can help reduce hospital stays, optimize therapies, and predict hospitalization probability. Transfer Learning:
 However, challenges include insufficient patient data, creating suitable rewards, and lengthy training periods. Solutions include population-based training, domain knowledge limitations, and transfer learning from high-fidelity simulators. Transfer Learning:
 These methods can help address the challenges of early hospitalization in diabetes care.Overall, deep learning offers various architectures and techniques to unlock insights from fragmented, complex EHR and patient data for predicting hospitalization risk  . Risk Prediction Model:
 Bayesian Monte Carlo methods [62] are popular in forecasting, long time prediction in episodes of data. Bayesian Monte Carlo methods are versatile in performing operations of forecast health risks. Risk Prediction Model:
 Prior domain knowledge and expert opinions can be incorporated using Bayesian models, which is helpful in the healthcare industry because data is frequently scarce. Monte Carlo sampling techniques, such as MCMC, offer even a versatile means of approximating posterior distributions for probabilistic forecasting. Risk Prediction Model:
 The capability of measuring or estimating predictions with uncertainty enhance risk assessment and facilitate more effective decision-making  . Selecting the right prior distributions is crucial and needs caution to prevent uncontrollably adding biases."

Diabetes is a terrible condition characterized by high blood glucose levels. This chronic condition is one of the leading causes of death for people worldwide. Early identification and prediction of diabetes can be aided by machine learning techniques. The purpose of this study is to use an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes efficiently in order to help the patients suffering from this lethal disease. Methods: The existing methods use a single model to predict diabetes, which may have an impact on accuracy because no one model can fit all datasets. Therefore we propose a robust model based on ensemble learning using hard voting classifier. Both the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and the Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset, which collect data on people with and without diabetes, were tested. For classification, the proposed ensemble hard voting classifier uses a combination of three machine learning algorithms namely logistic regression, decision tree, and support vector machine. Findings: On the PIMA diabetes dataset, the proposed ensemble approach achieves the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score value of 81.17%, while on the Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset, it achieves the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score value of 94.23%.

 Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that gets worse as the body loses the ability to use glucose  . It is a serious illnesses that affects people all over the world. This chronic illness is among the most common causes of mortality in people all over the world. It is estimated that there are approximately 415 million people throughout the world who https://www.indjst.org/ are between the ages of 20 and 79 and suffering with some sort of diabetic disease right now  . In 2013, global diabetes data showed that the disease affected 382 million people worldwide . It was the fifth biggest cause of mortality for women in 2012, and the eighth for both men and women . Diabetes is more common in high-income countries. It is anticipated that there would be 963 million diabetics in the globe by 2045, with half of the population untreated. In addition, in 2017, 850 million dollars have been spent on diabetes . A report claims that the prevalence of diabetes is increasing and that there are currently 500 million cases worldwide, with rates anticipated to reach 25% and 51% in 2030 and 2045, respectively  . Introduction:
 Alcohol, salicylates, and narcotics all raise A1C. Vitamin C may boost A1C levels by electrophoresis but reduce by chromatography. A higher leukocyte count during hypertension is associated with chronic inflammation, according to the majority of studies  . A single parameter can't diagnose diabetes and lead to wrong judgments. To accurately forecast diabetes at an early stage, different characteristics must be combined. Therefore automatic diabetes detection based on a combination of factors can assist clinicians in treating patients more effectively and efficiently. Machine learning based solutions are always promising because they learn from actual features to diagnose diabetes  . The enormous amount of data generated in this field presents two significant challenges for researchers and developers trying to construct diabetes predictive models. First off, the machine learning approaches utilized in earlier studies have been somewhat heterogeneous, making it difficult to choose the best one. Second, the features that were used to train the models are not transparent, which decreases their interpretability-a feature that is incredibly important to the clinician. Numerous studies on disease prediction, including diagnosis, prognosis, categorization, and therapy, have been conducted. Recent research demonstrates that a variety of machine learning methods have been utilized for disease identification and forecasting. They have resulted in significant efficiency benefits and improvements in both traditional and machine learning algorithm methodologies."

While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. A fairness-aware reweighting strategy was applied during training, and fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.</ns3:p> ","Jabbar et al. found that using RF with feature selection resulted in a much better prediction outcome. To determine the most pertinent predictors of IHD, Shah et al. used SVM with embedded feature selection, obtaining comparatively good accuracy with less model complexity. Traditional machine learning approaches:
 hese conventional approaches show limits when handling high-dimensional, nonlinear, and temporally dependent health data, notwithstanding their early success. To optimize predictions for a variety of biomedical datasets, Ampavathi and Saradhi presented a multi-disease prediction system built on a hybrid deep learning architecture. Traditional machine learning approaches:
 Although these models outperform conventional machine learning techniques, most of them are not interpretable or generalizable to other patient groups. The approach introduced by Andrew and Karthikeyan uses privacy-protecting XAI to combine how private data should be and how a model is explained for image analysis. Traditional machine learning approaches:
 According to the results, it is more important now to use models that are clear and practical. In contrast to other models created for post hoc explanation, ours makes SHAP explanations part of building the model, helping provide instant explanations for each prediction. Transfer learning for cardiovascular diagnosis:
 In healthcare applications, transfer learning has emerged as a successful tactic for enhancing model generalization and overcoming data shortage. To save training time and increase accuracy, it entails recycling weights from models that have been trained on big datasets for new, smaller domains. Transfer learning for cardiovascular diagnosis:
 A Recursion-Enhanced Random Forest model, pre-trained on extensive cardiovascular datasets and optimized for certain heart disease classification tasks, was proposed by Guo et al.  For better arrhythmia classification, Li et al. used a squeeze-and-excitation residual network pretrained on generic heartbeat datasets. Transfer learning for cardiovascular diagnosis:
 Performance on target datasets that would otherwise be too small to train sophisticated DL models was greatly enhanced in both situations by transfer learning. Transfer learning for cardiovascular diagnosis:
 The suggested model improves its performance on smaller datasets, such as UCI or actual hospital data, by initializing BiLSTM layers with cardiovascular domain knowledge through transfer learning. Fairness and bias mitigation in clinical AI:
 Concerns regarding algorithmic bias have grown in significance as AI systems become more and more integrated into healthcare decision-making. Research has demonstrated that a number of models operate differently for different genders, ages, and ethnicities, which results in unfair treatment outcomes. Fairness and bias mitigation in clinical AI:
 Although fairness was not specifically assessed, Sonawane and Patil suggested a hybrid heuristic-based clustering technique to balance performance across demographic categories. To guarantee equitable healthcare delivery, Rani et al. demanded that fairness criteria be incorporated into machine learning algorithms used for clinical risk prediction. Fairness and bias mitigation in clinical AI:
 By using demographic reweighting during training, the model directly addresses this problem with the goal of lowering prediction bias and enhancing equity across a range of demographics. Outcome of the literature survey:
 Using a range of ML and DL approaches, the body of existing work shows excellent progress in IHD prognosis. Nonetheless, several restrictions still exist: Outcome of the literature survey:
 Attention-residual models continue to lack integrated interpretability. Outcome of the literature survey:
 • Traditional machine learning models lack scalability and temporal awareness Outcome of the literature survey:
 • DL and hybrid models frequently operate as black boxes Outcome of the literature survey:
 • IHD models underutilize transfer learning"

INTRODUCTION:
 Diabetes mellitus carries a significant health risk and increases the likelihood of getting cardiovascular disease and more complications, which makes our lives suffer . I. INTRODUCTION:
 Insulin is essential for controlling blood glucose work, regulating the anabolism of carbohydrates, promoting physical growth, supervising cell division, and monitoring the anabolic activities of proteins and fats . I. INTRODUCTION:
 As a result, DM significantly impairs people's daily life and increases their risk of getting chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disorders, renal failure, and sightlessness . These disorders raise death rates . In 2019, it was estimated that 463 million individuals worldwide suffered from diabetes . I. INTRODUCTION:
 There are two main types of diabetes mellitus (DM): Type-1 Diabetes, an autoimmune sickness that destroys the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin, and the second type of Diabetes, a chronic that often raises blood sugar levels . I. INTRODUCTION:
 It can be challenging to differentiate between these kinds and choose the best course of action because doctors sometimes dispute about the best way to diagnose a patient . Globally, diabetes is becoming more common, especially in countries with middle incomes . I. INTRODUCTION:
 Therefore, research on diabetes prediction through machine learning (ML) techniques is needed to help specialists build the best possible treatment plans. By 2030, the Global Sustainable Development Group wants to eradicate diabetes-related early death . Consequently, scholars are consistently investigating various facets of diabetes mellitus. I. INTRODUCTION:
 A range of machine learning methods, including the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, are utilized in this endeavor, each providing special benefits for classification procedures . I. INTRODUCTION:
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory architecture and Multilayer perceptron's (MLPs) are two popular deep learning (DL) techniques that offer strong frameworks for managing sequential data and classification tasks . I. INTRODUCTION:
 In the healthcare sector, detecting DM at an early stage is challenging. Patient data is collected, including their ages, the mass of the body, the thickness of the skinfold in the triceps, insulin in the blood, plasma glucose level, the diastolic-bloodpressure, and other variables. I. INTRODUCTION:
 Patients then turn to doctors for specialist care. The doctor's medicating process becomes harder because of the lengthy, weeks-long decision-making process that depends on the doctor's expertise and experience . I. INTRODUCTION:
 Healthcare science research is currently supported by a wide range of publicly available medical databases. But managing such massive volumes of data by humans is frequently difficult, if not infeasible. Deep learning techniques deliver a solution because they grow and mimic how humans thinking. I. INTRODUCTION:

Diabetes is caused by an excess of sugar collected in the blood. Diabetes is one of the most serious chronic health issues. Diabetes sufferers' eyes, hearts, kidneys, and nerves may be damaged if they go undiagnosed. Humans can benefit from automated technologies to assist them in managing their hectic schedules. It inspires us to create a diabetes management scheme for patients that uses an IoT device to track their blood sugar, blood pressure, sports activities, nutrition plan, oxygen level, and ECG data. Machine learning has risen to prominence in healthcare services (HCS) due to its potential to enhance disease prediction. AI and ML approaches have already been used in the HCS field. We give a complete review of DL applications in diabetes in this study. We did a thorough literature review as well as discovered three key areas where this method is used: diabetes diagnosis, glucose control, and diabetes-related complication diagnosis. The search yielded 40 original research articles, from which we summarised essential data on used learning methods, development methods, main outcomes, and performance evaluation baseline techniques.

 K.   Although DL has advanced state of the art in various areas of diabetes, healthcare applications must be solid, dependable, and persuasive to avoid safety concerns as well as deliver significant treatment support. In this context, several restrictions and obstacles must be overcome before DL may be used in therapeutic settings. First, due to human errors and sensor abnormalities, data obtained from people with diabetes in realworld are prone to being imperfect. The process of gathering real data can be costly and timeconsuming. Sharing datasets among research teams might be problematic due to data privacy policies. As a result of these issues, many studies use a limited and sometimes insufficient amount of data. Furthermore, deep learning models are opaque. Why methods produce output for a specific input situation is crucial to physicians, especially for some critical decision-making applications. Intricate structures of DNN layers significantly learn patterns from non-linear data but impair interpretability of method. When looking into DL for diabetes, it's critical to think about trade-off between performance as well as interpretability. Finally, new algorithmic and hardware advances are likely to improve the efficiency of training DL methods."

DM is one of the major causes of blindness in young adults around the world. The most serious ocular complication of DM is diabetic retinopathy (DR).Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication in diabetes1, for the screening of which the retinal imaging is the most widely used method due to its high sensitivity in detecting retinopathy. Prompt diagnosis is important through efficient screening. The evaluation of the severity and degree of retinopathy associated with a person having diabetes is currently performed by medical experts based on the fundus or retinal images of the patient’s eyes As the number of patients with diabetes is rapidly increasing, the number of retinal images produced by the screening programmes will also increase, which in turn introduces a large labor-intensive burden on the medical experts as well as cost to the healthcare services. Manual grading of these images to determine the severity of DR is rather slow and resource demanding. This could be alleviated with an automated system either as support for medical experts’ work or as full diagnosis tool. This labor-intensive task could greatly benefit from automatic detection using machine learning technique. Early detection and timely treatment have been shown to prevent visual loss and blindness in patients with retinal complications of diabetes. Machine learning in recent years has been the evolving, reliable and supporting tools in medical domain and has provided the greatest support for predicting disease with correct case of training and testing. The objective of this paper is to explore the work happening on the detection, progression and feature selection process for the prediction of DR and to establish the extent and depth of existing knowledge on RD prediction process.","Title: A Machine Learning Approach for the Diagnosis of Diabetes : A Review Authors: Pravin S Rahate,Nikhat Raza Keywords: Machine Learning, Diabetic Macular, Diabetic Retinopathy, Image Screening I. INTRODUCTION:
 The prevalence of diabetes increased tenfold, from 1.2% to . It is estimated that 61.3 million people aged 20-79 years live with diabetes in India (2011 estimates). This number is expected to increase to 101.2 million by 2030 and 77.2 million people in India are said to have pre-diabetes. Diabetes affects people both in urban and rural India though the impact on urban India is higher. A most disturbing trend is the shift in age of onset of diabetes to a younger age. Indians get diabetes on average 10 years earlier than their Western counterparts. The risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) is two to four times higher in diabetic subjects, and in Indians, CAD occurs prematurely, i.e., one to two decades earlier than in the West. Costs of diabetes care are alarmingly high. According to the WHO, if one adult in a low-income family has diabetes, ""as much as 25% of family income may be devoted to diabetes care.  Lifestyle changes have lead to decreased physical activity, increased consumption of fat, sugar and calories, and higher stress levels, affecting insulin sensitivity and obesity. Also psychological factors are affecting the functioning of our body organs specially stress level and behavior of individual person may directly affect pancreas functioning. In other words there are so many factors (other than medico) which are affecting our health badly. Also their nature is of non linear way which makes the whole process more complicated as well as beyond the reach of human perception and analysis. The number of dimensions and nonlinear nature of parameters makes the diagnosis more challenging. I. INTRODUCTION:
 In all but the most trivial cases, insight or knowledge you're trying to get out of the raw data won't be obvious from looking at the data. Because now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complementary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it. With so much of the economic activity dependent on information, you can't afford to be lost in the data. I. INTRODUCTION:
 The widening gap between data and information calls for the systematic development of tools that can turn data tombs into ""golden nuggets"" of knowledge. I. INTRODUCTION:
 Machine learning will help you get through all the data and extract some information. Machine learning is turning data into information. Any field that needs to interpret and act on data can benefit from machine learning techniques. Machine learning uses statistics. I. INTRODUCTION:
 In a nutshell, machine learning is making sense of data. So if you have data you want to understand, if you want to get data and make sense of it, then machine learning is useful. I. INTRODUCTION:
 A basic function of information is to reduce uncertainty. It is often valuable to reduce uncertainty because of how risk affects the things we all do. It is difficult to say, but in general we would like to narrow things down in a way that maximizes the chances of a good outcome and minimizes the chance of a bad one."

Diabetes Mellitus can be caused by age, obesity, lack of exercise, inherited diabetes, lifestyle, poor food, high blood pressure, and other factors. Diabetes increases the risk of ailments such as heart disease, renal disease, stroke, vision problems, nerve damage, and so on. The current hospital practise is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests, and then give suitable therapy depending on the diagnosis. In the healthcare industry, big data analytics is extremely important. The healthcare industry has vast datasets. Big data analytics can be used to examine large datasets and uncover hidden information and trends in order to gain knowledge from the data and forecast outcomes. The categorization and prediction accuracy of the existing approach is not very good. In this study, we offer a diabetes prediction model for better diabetes classification that combines a few external factors that cause diabetes, as well as regular components such as glucose, BMI, age, and insulin. When compared to the old dataset, the new dataset improves classification accuracy. Furthermore, a diabetes prediction pipeline model was imposed with the goal of boosting classification accuracy. Machine learning is the way to go when we have a large data collection on which we want to perform predictive analysis or pattern identification.

Discussion: Subsequent studies should aim to develop inclusive AI models that synthesize genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variations, thereby preventing algorithmic bias and ensuring fair diabetes care. Challenges and future directions:
 The implementation of AI-driven precision medicine in T2D is hindered by generalizability challenges, as models often overlook the heterogeneity of the population in terms of genetic and socioeconomic determinants, which risks biased outcomes . Challenges and future directions:
 Algorithmic bias poses a threat to amplify health inequalities, especially in diabetes management, where underrepresented populations, such as ethnic minorities or low-income groups, can result in biased predictions . Challenges and future directions:
 Bias emerges from incomplete data that do not include cultural, linguistic, genetic, or environmental differences in underserved populations, and this amplifies disparities in low-and middle-income countries . Challenges and future directions:
 Thus, multiple datasets and fairaware algorithms are necessary, along with open science methodologies to counteract bias in the form of transparent data sharing and diverse model training . Data privacy takes precedence in the face of evolving regulations, which require safe storage and encryption to protect sensitive health information. Challenges and future directions:
 This is particularly important for AI systems managing diabetes, as they often handle large patient datasets that are susceptible to breaches . Challenges and future directions:
 Further, the integration of AI in India's healthcare system is being hindered by limited digital infrastructure and expensive solutions, particularly in rural regions, where access to highquality data and computing resources remains uneven . Challenges and future directions:
 Additional challenges include device interoperability, ethical considerations in algorithmic decision-making, and the need for adaptable regulatory frameworks to ensure the safe deployment of these technologies . Federated learning can promote generalizability and privacy by having models learn from decentralized data without sharing data centrally. Challenges and future directions:
 This facilitates collaborative development of AI across institutions while maintaining the confidentiality of patients with diabetes . Explainable AI can advance trust by making predictions transparent, allowing clinicians to comprehend model choices in real-time, such as during glucose monitoring or complication prediction. Challenges and future directions:
 These methods should be confirmed in the future in India to enable equitable, scalable diabetes management, with an emphasis on longitudinal research, integration with patient-oriented systems, and the remediation of disparities through personalized, AI-based interventions. Conclusions:
 In this study, we have investigated the use of AI for managing diabetes, with a special emphasis on incorporating CGM data and the distinctive phenotypic features of T2D in the Indian population. Conclusions:
 By using big data, AI instruments can identify high-risk subjects for developing diabetes, who can then be treated early and develop personalized treatment plans that incorporate genetic, lifestyle, and environmental determinants. Conclusions:
 Consequently, most AI-driven tools and technologies that support personalized medicine are focused on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of individuals. Moreover, by addressing these challenges, AI holds the potential to revolutionize diabetes management, offering more effective and personalized care and ultimately improving patient outcomes on a global scale."

Traditional methods, such as QRISK and the Framingham heart score, exhibit limitations in their ability to incorporate comprehensive patient data, potentially resulting in incomplete risk factor consideration. To address these shortcomings, this study explores the application of machine learning models. Machine learning models, such as support vector machines, and Random Forest, as well as deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives. These models offer superior performance, accommodating a broader spectrum of variables and providing precise subgroup-specific predictions. While machine learning integration holds promise for enhancing risk assessment, it presents challenges such as data requirements and computational constraints. Additionally, large language models have revolutionised healthcare applications, augmenting diagnostic precision and patient care. This study delves into the essence of cardiovascular disease event risk, evaluates traditional and machine learning models, and explores deep learning techniques for improved accuracy. It also investigates relevant datasets, benchmarks machine learning models against conventional approaches, and provides insights into the future of cardiovascular risk prediction. The potential of machine learning and large language models in cardiovascular medicine is undeniable. However, rigorous validation and optimisation are imperative before widespread application in healthcare. This integration promises more accurate and personalised cardiovascular care. ","model, especially in DL networks with lots of parameters. Overfitting and Underfitting:: Conversely, models can also underfit the training data (failing to capture the data's complexity), resulting in reduced accuracy in both the training and testing datasets . Missing Data::
 Missing data could include everything from variables with missing values to samples with unreported information. These can cause inaccuracy in the model. Of course, some ML techniques, such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbour, are capable of handling missing values directly . Interpretability::
 Machine Learning models, especially those applied to multi-omics data, can be intricate and challenging to interpret due to the complex relationships between different omics layers. The latest DL methods, in particular, are often considered black-box models, making interpretation difficult. Interpretability::
 Neural networks used in these algorithms extract features in a way that is hard to trace back and understand, leading to a lack of clarity in their output . The interpretability challenge poses difficulties in identifying and correcting potential errors within the model . Interpretability::
 Healthcare professionals often prefer ante-hoc interpretable models that are naturally understandable and intuitive  for instance, utilize a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to visually represent the factorization of the joint probability distribution of the data. Interpretability::
 This graphical representation explicitly shows the dependencies between input variables and the predicted outcome, making Bayesian models inherently interpretable . Legal and Ethical Issues:
 The interpretability of ML models can raise ethical and legal issues, especially as the complexity of input data and models increases. Healthcare professionals may not fully understand how a model reaches a specific conclusion about a patient's care. Legal and Ethical Issues:
 While physicians can be held legally liable for their actions, it is not apparent who should be held accountable when an ML model makes a poor choice . Comparison of the Performance of ML Models Against Traditional Methods:

Comparison of the Performance of ML Models Against Traditional Methods:
 One significant marker for elevated CVD risk among individuals with diabetes was found to be urinary microalbumin. Comparison of the Performance of ML Models Against Traditional Methods:
 In another prospective cohort study Traditional Tools:
 The integration of an ML model with coronary CT angiography (cCTA)-derived plaque measures and clinical data demonstrates remarkable predictive capabilities for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). In a recent study  outperformed other models in predicting CVD and CHD deaths, achieving AUCs of 0.845 and 0.860, respectively. Traditional Tools:
 This highlights the superior predictive accuracy of the ML approach and suggests its potential as a routine tool for clinical risk evaluation in cardiovascular medicine. Making and Patient Outcomes:
 The integration of ML into clinical decision-making is introducing a new era of precision and effectiveness. Traditionally, cardiovascular care relied on subjective visual interpretations and conventional risk assessment tools. However, ML is introducing a data-driven, evidence-based approach that reduces subjectivity and improves precision in clinical decision-making."

Application of machine learning and data mining techniques are used to transform the medical field into more intelligent and accurate. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorder exerting pressure on human health around the world. Diabetic leads to heart problems, kidney diseases, nerves damages, eye sight problems and also artery and vein damages. Existing set of machine learning algorithms are introduced to develop different types of models for prediction of diabetic conditions in patients and civilians. For better model of greater accuracy, this study introduces an enhancement of KNN algorithm, to predict the diabetic conditions. Keywords— Clinical information; diabetes mellitus; metabolic disorder; machine learning algorithms; KNN algorithm. I.INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease which occurs due to the lack of insulin in the human body. Pancreas is the insulin making organ in the human anatomy. When it is unable to continue its production of insulin, it leads to diabetes mellitus in human body. Insulin is a hormone which helps to convert glucose from the food we eat into energy. All carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which in turn aids the glucose to get into cells. Several health problems are created along with the development of diabetes. Mainly there are three kinds of diabetestype 1, type 2 and gestational [1]. A. Type 1 Diabetes These are mostly found in children and teenagers. In this case pancreas produces very little or no insulin, and the patient has to intake insulin as injection to maintain the blood glucose level. Although this is mostly found in children this can be developed at any age at any time. B. Type 2 Diabetes These are common in adults. Normally in human body after a certain age pancreas shows laziness to create insulin [11]. As a result, the patient requires oral drugs and insulin, to keep the glucose level under control. C. Gestational Diabetes This is a special type of diabetes which leads to high blood glucose during the pregnancy period in females. This will result in complications for both mother and the child. It will mostly disappear after the delivery but high probability exists for mother or child to be prone to develop type 2 diabetes in the future. The main symptoms of diabetics are weight loss, increased thirst and hunger, increase in urination, wounds which do not heal, blurred vision and tiredness [2]. Type 1 diabetes symptoms may start early but type 2 diabetes symptoms develop slowly over years. Many people are unable to recognize the matter until they fall in the hands of major health traps such as blindness, heart failure etc. Treatment of Type 1 diabetes is insulin injection or pumping insulin to the body. Thus, by taking insulin externally helps to stabilize the glucose in body cells. But the count of insulin must be precise and accurate according to the need of the body. This is based on food, general health, stress, emotions, sleeping habits. These factors relate to burn of extra glucose. If the patient consumes insulin above the need, it leads to dropping of blood sugar to dangerously low level and it can be life threatening. This is hypoglycemia. And if the intake of insulin is too little, the blood sugar can raise to dangerously high level. This is hyperglycemia and can lead to long term complications which can be life threatening. Type 2 diabetes is mostly found in people, that is 90% of diabetic patients are in the category of type 2. Since it is developed after the age of 35, it is also called adult onset diabetes. People with type 2 can produce certain amount of insulin in their body, but that may not be sufficient to open the cells and to allow the glucose to enter. This is called insulin resistance. So additional insulin must be given from outside to solve this issue. Most of the symptoms of type 2 are similar as type 1. But in type 2 case the symptoms are usually slower, so the people are not aware about the diabetic disease until it progresses into a late stage. Treatment of diabetes focuses on diet, exercise and intake of insulin as oral or injection. Diagnosis and prediction in diabetes mellitus is mainly detected by the following steps: International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT) ISSN: 2278-0181 http://www.ijert.org IJERTV9IS060535 (This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.)

Gestational Diabetes: Treatment of diabetes focuses on diet, exercise and intake of insulin as oral or injection. Diagnosis and prediction in diabetes mellitus is mainly detected by the following steps: C. Gestational Diabetes:
 • A1C test: alpha-glycosylated hemoglobin test • Random blood sugar test • Fasting blood sugar test Metabolomics, proteomics and genomics are the common biomarkers. Researches in the study of used membrane fluidity of type 1 diabetes and the decision system have directed to monitor the pathology of diabetes mellitus . Applying machine learning techniques and data analysis to diabetic medical record have improved the traditional recognition of diabetes. The researchers have proposed a solution of hybrid machine learning to solve the problem of uneven of medical data distribution. C. Gestational Diabetes:
 As of the survey of United States in 2015, 30.3 million people have diabetes, i.e., 9.4% of total population. And half of them were unaware that they had this disease . To avoid this incident of unawareness, a program to confirm and predict whether one has the disease or the chance of being a patient in the coming years, a software to check this by themselves has to be introduced. The feature of these software should consider heredity of the tester. The scope of this software will be very high in the future because the living style and food habit of people is leading towards diabetes. C. Gestational Diabetes:
 The study focuses on diabetes in female, and the software is developed for mainly checking for women who had undergone pregnancy, since they have high chance of falling under the grasp of diabetes due to gestational diabetes during pregnancies. This software gives them a future indication for the DM, so that they can take necessary prevention. This software is also applicable for ladies who had never undergone pregnancies II.MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM Machine learning algorithm connects the problems from the data samples which collected from general concepts of reasoning. Machine learning can be divided into 2 process : C. Gestational Diabetes:
 • Discovering data dependencies from a given dataset. C. Gestational Diabetes:
 • From established relations to create outputs for new inputs. C. Gestational Diabetes:
 Machine learning can be classified into: - A. Supervised Learning:
 In which the system creates a function from a labelled training data. The target function is used to predict the value of a variable (dependent variable or output variable) from a set of features (independent variable or input variable) . Set of input values of the function are called instants is its domain. Each case is explained by a set of characteristics or attributes or features. Training data is a subset of all features for which the target variable is known. To generate the best target function, the learning system, a training set, an alternative function called hypothesis is taken into consideration. Classification and regression are 2 kinds of learning tasks for the supervised learning . Models which predict distinct classes like blood group is classification and the regression predicts the numerical value. Most common technique in supervised learning are decision tree (DT), K-Nearest neighbors, rule learning, genetic algorithms, support of vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN). B. Unsupervised Learning:
 In which the learning system try to generate a structure from unlabeled data. i.e., the system tries to discover the hidden structure of data or relationship between variables."

Moreover, over time, it will lead to chronic complications. Predictive models have been used to identify people with a tendency to develop diabetes mellitus. At the same time, there is limited information regarding the chronic complications of patients with diabetes. Our study is aimed at creating a machine-learning model that will be able to identify the risk factors of a diabetic patient developing chronic complications such as amputations, myocardial infarction, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The design is a national nested case-control study with 63,776 patients and 215 predictors with four years of data. Using an XGBoost model, the prediction of chronic complications has an AUC of 84%, and the model has identified the risk factors for chronic complications in patients with diabetes. According to the analysis, the most crucial risk factors based on SHAP values (Shapley additive explanations) are continued management, metformin treatment, age between 68 and 104 years, nutrition consultation, and treatment adherence. But we highlight two exciting findings. The first is a reaffirmation that high blood pressure figures across patients with diabetes without hypertension become a significant risk factor at diastolic > 70 mmHg (OR: 1.095, 95% CI: 1.078-1.113) or systolic > 120 mmHg (OR: 1.147, 95% CI: 1.124-1.171). Furthermore, people with diabetes with a BMI > 32 (overall obesity) (OR: 0.816, 95% CI: 0.8-0.833) have a statistically significant protective factor, which the paradox of obesity may explain. In conclusion, the results we have obtained show that artificial intelligence is a powerful and feasible tool to use for this type of study. However, we suggest that more studies be conducted to verify and elaborate upon our findings.","reflected the reality of the patients . Furthermore, we conducted the study without altering the database and without imputation of values-allowing the algorithm and accompanying techniques to study the discriminant variables for the model as recorded by physicians at the primary care level. Journal of Diabetes Research:
 Additionally, in 2018, Dagliati et al. carried out a study with a similar approach to the present . However, a bias was committed by not testing more than one machine learning algorithm. Moreover, before the study, they used logistic regression in a European population, which may reflect a different trend than a Hispanic population . Therefore, for this case, we decided to carry out a fit test with 14 models of machine learning. Journal of Diabetes Research:
 It is important to note that this study was conducted to identify risk factors for chronic complications, encompassing amputations, myocardial infarction, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy, without focusing on any particular affliction. Nevertheless, our results have generated information that supports future research aimed at the genesis of applicable instruments or strategies to benefit patients. In this sense, we must continue promoting the use of current and validated strategies and instruments for the care and prevention of complications in patients with DM, such as the determination of the degree of stiffness of the ankle, the use of the Foot Posture Index, or the use of the DFSQ, beneficial to prevent injuries or amputations of the pelvic limbs . Journal of Diabetes Research:
 We are no strangers to the wide variety of initiatives on machine learning focused on diabetes mellitus that have been launched since 2005 in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The Nordic Precision Medicine Initiative is the largest, formed in 2015, and intended to collect data from more than one million Nordic citizens . Unfortunately, no publication in Mexico has included any initiative to make a comparable database. However, this project can provide a starting point for such an initiative. In addition, we demonstrate that Mexican programs already have value-rich data collection to extract insights for our Mexican patients. Journal of Diabetes Research:
 4.1. Limitations. We recognize that all the subjects in this study share the same pathology, diabetes mellitus type 2, declared in the inclusion criteria. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to all individuals, although the complications studied occur in other conditions. Journal of Diabetes Research:
 Machine learning can be applied to medical records to develop robust risk models. However, our healthcare system is reluctant to entrust a machine with a human's task with mistakes. However, if we change the vision, this may sound acceptable. Machine learning is not here to replace any human job. It is here to help as a second opinion based on our population's thousands or even millions of records . Journal of Diabetes Research:
 There is a dissociation between machine learning developers, regulatory bodies, health services researchers, doctors, and patients to generate new or more in-depth knowledge about the pathologies under study . In addition, our project only covered patients served by one of the three public systems in the country; therefore, collection initiatives from the other systems would contribute significant value to this type of study. Strengths.:
 Most studies do not use longitudinal data, employ relatively few predictive variables with a median of 27, and rarely develop multicenter models . In our case, the data is longitudinal, we start with 166 variables, and the data comes from all over the country."
