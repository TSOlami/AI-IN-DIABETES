- **Reasoning:** Integrates image‑based deep learning with LLMs for diabetes management, directly applies to DR screening, provides decision support and real‑world deployment, and fuses imaging with language; lacks federated learning, bias analysis, and transfer learning components.","Abstract Primary diabetes care and diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening persist as major public health challenges due to a shortage of trained primary care physicians (PCPs), particularly in low-resource settings. Here, to bridge the gaps, we developed an integrated image–language system (DeepDR-LLM), combining a large language model (LLM module) and image-based deep learning (DeepDR-Transformer), to provide individualized diabetes management recommendations to PCPs. In a retrospective evaluation, the LLM module demonstrated comparable performance to PCPs and endocrinology residents when tested in English and outperformed PCPs and had comparable performance to endocrinology residents in Chinese. For identifying referable DR, the average PCP’s accuracy was 81.0% unassisted and 92.3% assisted by DeepDR-Transformer. Furthermore, we performed a single-center real-world prospective study, deploying DeepDR-LLM. We compared diabetes management adherence of patients under the unassisted PCP arm ( n = 397) with those under the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm ( n = 372). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm showed better self-management behaviors throughout follow-up ( P &lt; 0.05). For patients with referral DR, those in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm were more likely to adhere to DR referrals ( P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, DeepDR-LLM deployment improved the quality and empathy level of management recommendations. Given its multifaceted performance, DeepDR-LLM holds promise as a digital solution for enhancing primary diabetes care and DR screening. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning with FedDEO to classify diabetic retinopathy images, achieving high accuracy while preserving privacy; focuses on DR detection, not multimodal or bias analysis.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness among adults worldwide. Detecting and classifying DR early is essential for timely treatment and prevention of vision loss. This study introduces a new approach to identify and classify DR by using federated learning (FL) environment and Federated differential evolution optimization (FedDEO). FL enables collaborative learning across multiple decentralized devices while maintaining data privacy. FedDEO optimization enhances the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters in a distributed manner. The research achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in DR classification using the MESSIDOR dataset for training and testing. The findings suggest that integrating FedDEO optimization within the FL framework can significantly improve DR detection, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for ophthalmic healthcare. The FedDEO algorithm optimizes hyperparameters, including learning rates and batch sizes, to enhance model performance. The experiments show that FedDEO works effectively for the MESSIDOR dataset to achieve a high classification accuracy, specificity, recall, and F1-Measure of 96.98%, 98.12%, 97.12%, and 98.00% while preserving privacy. The results demonstrate that implementing these algorithms in an FL environment significantly improves privacy and performance compared to other approaches. Specifically, the proposed technique outperforms others in terms of accuracy, specificity, recall, and F1 score when applied to categorizing retinal images. "

Existing DAs often struggle with domain disparities, hindering DR grading performance compared to clinical diagnosis. A source-free active domain adaptation method (SFADA), which generates features of color fundus images by noise, selects valuable ultra-wide-field (UWF) fundus images through local representation matching, and adapts models using DR lesion prototypes, is proposed to upgrade DR diagnostic accuracy. Importantly, SFADA enhances data security and patient privacy by excluding source domain data. It reduces image resolution and boosts model training speed by modeling DR grade relationships directly. Experiments show SFADA significantly improves DR grading performance, increasing accuracy by 20.90% and quadratic weighted kappa by 18.63% over baseline, reaching 85.36% and 92.38%, respectively. This suggests SFADA's promise for real clinical applications. "

We also implemented interpretability features to provide clinicians with insight into the significance of biomarkers. Results showed a 6.2% improvement in minority class recall when pharmaceutical biomarkers were combined with diffusion-based augmentation.

Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Conclusion GlucoNet‐MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy‐aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

The study participants comprised of 80 normal subjects and age- and sex-matched 80 diabetes patients. The biochemical tests such as fasting glucose, postprandial, Hba1c are taken for all the participants. The visible and thermal tongue images are acquired using digital single lens reference camera and thermal infrared cameras, respectively. The digital and thermal tongue images are fused based on the wavelet transform method. Then Gray level co-occurrence matrix features are extracted individually from the visible, thermal, and fused tongue images. The machine learning classifiers and deep learning networks such as VGG16 and ResNet50 was used to classify the normal and diabetes mellitus. Image quality metrics are implemented to compare the classifiers’ performance before and after fusion. Support vector machine outperformed the machine learning classifiers, well after fusion with an accuracy of 88.12% compared to before the fusion process (Thermal-84.37%; Visible-63.1%). VGG16 produced the classification accuracy of 94.37% after fusion and attained 90.62% and 85% before fusion of individual thermal and visible tongue images, respectively. Therefore, this study results indicates that fused tongue images might be used as a non-contact elemental tool for pre-screening type II diabetes mellitus. "

Nevertheless, the challenges of mining latent knowledge within diagnostic data and explaining results to healthcare professionals have limited the application of many algorithms in clinical practice. To address these issues, our study introduces an Interpretable Predictor with Deep Convolutional Fuzzy Neural Network (IP-DCFNN). The proposed model is capable of assessing disease risk based on individual data and providing interpretable justifications to aid in medical diagnosis and treatment decisions. By deconstructing the fuzzy inference process and incorporating convolutional neural network, our approach enhances the ability to discover underlying information while maintaining transparency and interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a grid partition-based method for initializing the antecedent parameters and a hybrid approach that combines gradient descent with least squares estimation for training. Compared with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) Our model has an average improvement of 7.4% on prediction accuracy. More importantly, it can extract interpretable insights from membership functions, rule bases, and fuzzy contributions, offering valuable knowledge for medical research on type 2 diabetes, supporting intelligent diagnostic processes and providing personalized healthcare recommendations. The model can also be applied on the diagnosis and treatment of various other diseases. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses Transformer meta‑learning for zero‑shot glucose prediction, directly applying deep learning to CGM data across diverse diabetic cohorts; demonstrates strong generalization, though lacks multimodal, federated, imaging, or bias analyses.","Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), augmented with accurate glucose prediction, offers an effective strategy for maintaining blood glucose levels within a therapeutically appropriate range. This is particularly crucial for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who require long-term self-management. However, with extensive glycemic variability, developing a prediction algorithm applicable across diverse populations remains a significant challenge. Leveraging meta-learning for domain generalization, we propose GPFormer, a Transformer-based zero-shot learning method designed for multi-horizon glucose prediction. We developed GPFormer on the REPLACE-BG dataset, comprising 226 participants with T1D, and proceeded to evaluate its performance using three external clinical datasets with CGM data. These included the OhioT1DM dataset, a publicly available dataset including 12 T1D participants, as well as two proprietary datasets. The first proprietary dataset included 22 participants, while the second contained 45 participants, encompassing a diverse group with T1D, type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes, including patients admitted to hospitals. These four datasets include both outpatient and inpatient settings, various intervention strategies, and demographic variability, which effectively reflect real-world scenarios of CGM usage. When compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods, GPFormer consistently demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest root mean square error for all the evaluated datasets up to a prediction horizon of two hours. These experimental results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed model across a variety of populations, demonstrating its substantial potential to enhance glucose management in a wide range of practical clinical settings.

The state of the art of BG prediction has been achieved by leveraging advanced deep learning methods to model multi-modal data, i.e., sensor data and self-reported event data, organised as multi-variate time series (MTS). However, these methods are mostly regarded as ``black boxes'' and not entirely trusted by clinicians and patients. In this paper, we propose interpretable graph attentive recurrent neural networks (GARNNs) to model MTS, explaining variable contributions via summarizing variable importance and generating feature maps by graph attention mechanisms instead of post-hoc analysis. We evaluate GARNNs on four datasets, representing diverse clinical scenarios. Upon comparison with twelve well-established baseline methods, GARNNs not only achieve the best prediction accuracy but also provide high-quality temporal interpretability, in particular for postprandial glucose levels as a result of corresponding meal intake and insulin injection. These findings underline the potential of GARNN as a robust tool for improving diabetes care, bridging the gap between deep learning technology and real-world healthcare solutions. "

To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM (eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports. These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1).

- **Reasoning:** Uses CNN and multistage transfer learning for retinal fundus images, directly targeting diabetic retinopathy detection with high sensitivity, but lacks interpretability or bias analysis.","Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most threatening complications of diabetes that leads to permanent blindness if left untreated. One of the essential challenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success. Unfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is notoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images. Simplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of people. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself. However, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency between different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus. Additionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which makes use of similar datasets with different labeling. The presented method can be used as a screening method for early detection of diabetic retinopathy with sensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and is ranked 54 of 2943 competing methods (quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.925466) on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset (13000 images)."

The early detection of DR is crucial for effective treatment, as symptoms often manifest in later stages. The manual grading of retinal images is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks patient-friendliness. In this study, we propose two deep learning (DL) architectures, a hybrid network combining VGG16 and XGBoost Classifier, and the DenseNet 121 network, for DR detection and classification. To evaluate the two DL models, we preprocessed a collection of retinal images obtained from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Kaggle Dataset. This dataset exhibits an imbalanced image class distribution, which we addressed through appropriate balancing techniques. The performance of the considered models was assessed in terms of accuracy. The results showed that the hybrid network achieved an accuracy of 79.50%, while the DenseNet 121 model achieved an accuracy of 97.30%. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing methods utilizing the same dataset revealed the superior performance of the DenseNet 121 network.

The superior performance of the DenseNet 121 model highlights its effectiveness in this domain. The implementation of such automated methods can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of DR diagnosis, benefiting both healthcare providers and patients."

- **Reasoning:** Uses CNN and multistage transfer learning for retinal fundus image classification, directly targeting diabetic retinopathy detection. Provides high sensitivity/specificity but lacks interpretability or fairness analysis.","Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most threatening complications of diabetes that leads to permanent blindness if left untreated. One of the essential challenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success. Unfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is notoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images. Simplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of people. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself. However, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency between different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus. Additionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which makes use of similar datasets with different labeling. The presented method can be used as a screening method for early detection of diabetic retinopathy with sensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and is ranked 54 of 2943 competing methods (quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.925466) on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset (13000 images)."

However, developing a model generalized to a population and subsequently embedding it within a microchip of a wearable device presents significant technical challenges. Furthermore, the domain of BG prediction in T2D remains under-explored in the literature. In light of this, we propose a population-specific BG prediction model, leveraging the capabilities of the temporal fusion Transformer (TFT) to adjust predictions based on personal demographic data. Then the trained model is embedded within a system-on-chip, integral to our low-power and low-cost customized wearable device. This device seamlessly communicates with CGM systems through Bluetooth and provides timely BG predictions using edge computing. When evaluated on two publicly available clinical datasets with a total of 124 participants with T1D or T2D, the embedded TFT model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest prediction errors when compared with a range of machine learning baseline methods. Executing the TFT model on our wearable device requires minimal memory and power consumption, enabling continuous decision support for more than 51 days on a single Li-Poly battery charge. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of the proposed TFT model and wearable device in enhancing the quality of life for people with diabetes and effectively addressing real-world challenges."

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep attentive CNN with attention mechanisms for DR grading on fundus images, directly applying AI to a diabetes‑related imaging task; includes some interpretability via attention but lacks broader trustworthiness analyses.","Automated fine-grained diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading was of great significance for assisting ophthalmologists in monitoring DR and designing tailored treatments for patients. Nevertheless, it is a challenging task as a result of high intra-class variations, high inter-class similarities, small lesions, and imbalanced data distributions. The pivotal factor for the success in fine-grained DR grading is to discern more subtle associated lesion features, such as microaneurysms (MA), Hemorrhages (HM), soft exudates (SE), and hard exudates (HE). In this paper, we constructed a simple yet effective deep attentive convolutional neural network (DACNN) for DR grading and lesion discovery with only image-wise supervision. Designed as a top-down architecture, our model incorporated stochastic atrous spatial pyramid pooling (sASPP), global attention mechanism (GAM), category attention mechanism (CAM), and learnable connected module (LCM) to better extract lesion-related features and maximize the DR grading performance. To be concrete, we devised sASPP combining randomness with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to accommodate the various scales of the lesions and struggle against the co-adaptation of multiple atrous convolutions. Then, GAM was introduced to extract class-agnostic global attention feature details, whilst CAM was explored for seeking class-specific distinctive region-level lesion feature information and regarding each DR severity grade in an equal way, which tackled the problem of imbalance DR data distributions. Further, the LCM was designed to automatically and adaptively search the optimal connections among layers for better extracting detailed small lesion feature representations. The proposed approach obtained high accuracy of 88.0% and kappa score of 88.6% for multi-class DR grading task on the EyePACS dataset, respectively, while 98.5% AUC, 93.8% accuracy, 87.9% kappa, 90.7% recall, 94.6% precision, and 92.6% F1-score for referral and non-referral classification on the Messidor dataset. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved competitive performance in DR grading and lesion discovery using retinal fundus images compared with existing cutting-edge methods, and had good generalization capacity for unseen DR datasets. These promising results highlighted its potential as an efficient and reliable tool to assist ophthalmologists in large-scale DR screening."

As a result, having a regular eye exam is critical for maintaining a healthy retina and preventing damage to the eyes. Due to the lack of ophthalmologists in developing countries, there should be a faster approach to analyze the condition of these fundus images collected by different opticians. In this case, developing deep learning approaches comes in handy to enhance the effectiveness of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis accurately. Our main motivation is to develop a system that could manage various medical institutions.

The AI-based algorithm not only classifies an image as pathological or not but also detects and highlights those signs that allow DR to be identified. For development, we have used a database of about half a million images classified in a real clinical environment by family doctors (FDs), ophthalmologists, or both. The AI was able to detect more than 95% of cases worse than mild DR and had 70% fewer misclassifications of healthy cases than FDs. In addition, the AI was able to detect DR signs in 1258 patients before they were detected by FDs, representing 7.9% of the total number of DR patients detected by the FDs. These results suggest that AI is at least comparable to the evaluation of FDs.

- **Reasoning:** Uses attention-based deep learning with transfer learning for DR grading, provides lesion-specific explainable maps, focuses on diabetic retinopathy imaging, but lacks multimodal, federated, or bias analyses.","Early detection and grading of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is essential to determine an adequate treatment and prevent severe vision loss. However, the manual analysis of fundus images is time consuming and DR screening programs are challenged by the availability of human graders. Current automatic approaches for DR grading attempt the joint detection of all signs at the same time. However, the classification can be optimized if red lesions and bright lesions are independently processed since the task gets divided and simplified. Furthermore, clinicians would greatly benefit from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to support the automatic model predictions, especially when the type of lesion is specified. As a novelty, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for automatic DR grading (5 severity degrees) based on separating the attention of the dark structures from the bright structures of the retina. As the main contribution, this approach allowed us to generate independent interpretable attention maps for red lesions, such as microaneurysms and hemorrhages, and bright lesions, such as hard exudates, while using image-level labels only.Our approach is based on a novel attention mechanism which focuses separately on the dark and the bright structures of the retina by performing a previous image decomposition. This mechanism can be seen as a XAI approach which generates independent attention maps for red lesions and bright lesions. The framework includes an image quality assessment stage and deep learning-related techniques, such as data augmentation, transfer learning and fine-tuning. We used the architecture Xception as a feature extractor and the focal loss function to deal with data imbalance.The Kaggle DR detection dataset was used for method development and validation. The proposed approach achieved 83.7 % accuracy and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.78 to classify DR among 5 severity degrees, which outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches. Nevertheless, the main result of this work is the generated attention maps, which reveal the pathological regions on the image distinguishing the red lesions and the bright lesions. These maps provide explainability to the model predictions.Our results suggest that our framework is effective to automatically grade DR. The separate attention approach has proven useful for optimizing the classification. On top of that, the obtained attention maps facilitate visual interpretation for clinicians. Therefore, the proposed method could be a diagnostic aid for the early detection and grading of DR. "

Manual diagnosis of DR by medical experts is time-consuming; hence, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) solution for faster identification and improved efficiency is required. Diagnosis of DR is complex due to the prevalence of inter-class differences and small lesions, making it difficult for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify discriminative regions effectively. The most critical challenge is locating complex patterns connected with visual differences and lesion locations. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this work presents a novel multi-resolution convolutional attention network (MuR-CAN), which improves overall performance by emphasizing discriminative features. MuR-CAN includes a multi-dilation attention block (MDAB), which uses depth-wise convolution layers with various dilation rates to allow the model to prioritize relevant features and capture multi-scale spatial information. This method provides for simultaneously highlighting fine features and subtle visual patterns. Furthermore, the features extracted from the MuR-CAN are utilized to train the support vector machine (SVM) for DR classification. The integration of the SVM classifier with the proposed CNN architecture ensures improved accuracy. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. "

We evaluate the RETAIN model on the type-2 IDIAB and the type-1 OhioT1DM datasets by comparing its statistical and clinical performances against two deep models and three models based on decision trees. We show that the RETAIN model offers a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable. We show the usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than one hour are not used by the RETAIN model for the 30-minutes ahead of time prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions. In particular, it showed that the patient's state before the event is particularily important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to its interpretability, seems to be a very promissing model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare."

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) facilitates blood glucose level prediction (BGLP), allowing for timely interventions based on insulin delivery and carbohydrate intake to prevent complications. Current research has developed sequential models to predict BGLP, incorporating historical BG data along with factors like meal and insulin intake. These models show high performance and some temporal explainability but lack clarity in showing the importance of each attribute and risk privacy by merging data from multiple participants. To address these issues, a novel approach utilizing a graph attention memory (GAM) model comprising a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and a graph attention network (GAT) is proposed. Various data can be organized as multivariate time series, and GAT models the patterns among multiple variables. This method enhances attribute correlation modeling and provides transparent attribute relationships through dynamic graph structures, with attention weights indicating attribute importance over time. Then, GRU aggregates graph features, generating compact vectors for future BG prediction. Additionally, we employ federated learning (FL) for privacy-preserving population pattern learning. FL enables data to be leveraged in local devices rather than being sent to other places, protecting patients' privacy. In our experiments, evaluated using data from the OhioT1DM dataset, our proposed methods demonstrated stability and effectiveness.

However, the classification task is challenging due to imbalanced datasets, small lesions, and inter-class similarity. This study proposes a novel deep integrative approach for DR classification, leveraging the strengths of residual blocks, channel-spatial attention mechanism (CSAM), and non-local blocks (NLB). The proposed architecture consists of a sequence of residual blocks followed by CSAM modules, which enhance feature discriminability at different scales in DR images. Additionally, the outputs from CSAM blocks are fed into an NLB to capture long-range dependencies, allowing the model to consider global context information. The proposed architecture primarily utilizes the strength of global features extracted from non-local blocks and fuses them to enrich the information representation.

Automatic DR grading with deep learning can help ophthalmologists treat patients in a timely manner. However, it is difficult to accurately grade DR because fundus images contain several different DR-related lesions such as soft exudates (SEs), hemorrhages (HEs), microaneurysms (MAs), and hard exudates (EXs), which are largely different in shape, appearance, and spatial location, and there exists strong multilesion dependency that can greatly affect the final grading results. In this article, a cross-lesion attention network (CLANet) is proposed, which can adaptively learn rich and discriminative imaging features from complicated lesions and model the dependencies of DR-related lesions. It consists of two main parts as follows. First, an adaptive lesion-aware (ALA) module based on adaptive channel-spatial convolution (ACSConv) can dynamically adjust convolution filters with different receptive fields to learn imaging features according to different DR lesions, so as to more flexibly and robustly handle the diversity of DR lesion features. Then, a cross-scale context attention (CSCA) module is developed to explore the dependencies of multiple DR-related lesions by sufficiently taking advantage of the long-range dependence learning ability of context network, which is further aggregated to learn multiscale context features in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experimental results on the public DR grading datasets [i.e., IDRiD, Messidor, and dataset for DR (DDR)] show that the proposed CLANet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."

Design Retrospective analysis of clinical OCT and OCTA scans of control and diabetic patients. Participants The data used for microvasculature segmentation consisted of OCTA en face images acquired from four OCT instruments with a total of 153 images, with fields-of-view ranging from 2×2mm to 6×6mm. The data used for RDR classification consisted of OCTA en face images and structural OCT projections acquired from two commercial OCT systems with a total of 700 images. Methods OCTA images used for microvasculature segmentation were manually delineated and verified by retina experts. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was evaluated by retinal specialists and condensed into two classes: non-referable DR, and RDR. The federated learning configuration was demonstrated via simulation using four clients for microvasculature segmentation and compared with other collaborative methods. Subsequently, federated learning was applied over multiple institutions for RDR classification, and was compared with models trained and tested on data from the same institution (internal models) and different institutions (external models). Main Outcome Measures:For microvasculature segmentation, we measured the accuracy and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). For severity classification, we measured accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, area under the precision-recall curve, balanced accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of further stratified severities. Results For both applications, federated learning achieved similar performance to internal models. Additionally, for microvasculature segmentation, the federated learning model achieved similar performance (mean DSC across all test sets 0.793) to models trained on a fully-centralized dataset (mean DSC: 0.807). For RDR classification, federated learning achieved an AUROC of 0.944–0.970; the internal models attained an AUROC of 0.945-0.978. Similar results are reflected in the other calculated evaluation metrics. Conclusions Federated learning shows similar results to traditional deep learning in both applications of segmentation and classification, while maintaining data privacy. Evaluation metrics highlight the potential of collaborative learning for increasing domain diversity and the generalizability of models used for the classification of OCT data."

No multimodal, federated, or bias analyses; model built on prior data without explicit transfer learning.","Importance More than 60 million people in India have diabetes and are at risk for diabetic retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening disease. Automated interpretation of retinal fundus photographs can help support and scale a robust screening program to detect DR. Objective To prospectively validate the performance of an automated DR system across 2 sites in India. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective observational study was conducted at 2 eye care centers in India (Aravind Eye Hospital and Sankara Nethralaya) and included 3049 patients with diabetes. Data collection and patient enrollment took place between April 2016 and July 2016 at Aravind and May 2016 and April 2017 at Sankara Nethralaya. The model was trained and fixed in March 2016. Interventions Automated DR grading system compared with manual grading by 1 trained grader and 1 retina specialist from each site. Adjudication by a panel of 3 retinal specialists served as the reference standard in the cases of disagreement. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity and specificity for moderate or worse DR or referable diabetic macula edema. Results Of 3049 patients, 1091 (35.8%) were women and the mean (SD) age for patients at Aravind and Sankara Nethralaya was 56.6 (9.0) years and 56.0 (10.0) years, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, the sensitivity and specificity for manual grading by individual nonadjudicator graders ranged from 73.4% to 89.8% and from 83.5% to 98.7%, respectively. The automated DR system’s performance was equal to or exceeded manual grading, with an 88.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 85.8-91.5), 92.2% specificity (95% CI, 90.3-93.8), and an area under the curve of 0.963 on the data set from Aravind Eye Hospital and 92.1% sensitivity (95% CI, 90.1-93.8), 95.2% specificity (95% CI, 94.2-96.1), and an area under the curve of 0.980 on the data set from Sankara Nethralaya. Conclusions and Relevance This study shows that the automated DR system generalizes to this population of Indian patients in a prospective setting and demonstrates the feasibility of using an automated DR grading system to expand screening programs."

Yet, existing Bayesian deep learning methods fall short of this promise; new methods continue to be evaluated on unrealistic test beds that do not reflect the complexities of downstream real-world tasks that would benefit most from reliable uncertainty quantification. We propose the RETINA Benchmark, a set of real-world tasks that accurately reflect such complexities and are designed to assess the reliability of predictive models in safety-critical scenarios. Specifically, we curate two publicly available datasets of high-resolution human retina images exhibiting varying degrees of diabetic retinopathy, a medical condition that can lead to blindness, and use them to design a suite of automated diagnosis tasks that require reliable predictive uncertainty quantification. We use these tasks to benchmark well-established and state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning methods on task-specific evaluation metrics. We provide an easy-to-use codebase for fast and easy benchmarking following reproducibility and software design principles. We provide implementations of all methods included in the benchmark as well as results computed over 100 TPU days, 20 GPU days, 400 hyperparameter configurations, and evaluation on at least 6 random seeds each."

These devices typically utilise simple control algorithms to select the optimal insulin dose for maintaining blood glucose levels within a healthy range. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilised as a method for further enhancing glucose control in these devices. Previous approaches have been shown to reduce patient risk and improve time spent in the target range when compared to classical control algorithms, but are prone to instability in the learning process, often resulting in the selection of unsafe actions. This work presents an evaluation of offline RL for developing effective dosing policies without the need for potentially dangerous patient interaction during training. This paper examines the utility of BCQ, CQL and TD3-BC in managing the blood glucose of the 30 virtual patients available within the FDA-approved UVA/Padova glucose dynamics simulator. When trained on less than a tenth of the total training samples required by online RL to achieve stable performance, this work shows that offline RL can significantly increase time in the healthy blood glucose range from 61.6 +\- 0.3% to 65.3 +/- 0.5% when compared to the strongest state-of-art baseline (p < 0.001). This is achieved without any associated increase in low blood glucose events. Offline RL is also shown to be able to correct for common and challenging control scenarios such as incorrect bolus dosing, irregular meal timings and compression errors."

We evaluate the model on a real-world type-2 diabetic population and we compare it to a random forest model and a LSTM-based recurrent neural network. Our results show that the RETAIN model outperforms the former and equals the latter on common accuracy metrics and clinical acceptability metrics, thereby proving its legitimacy in the context of glucose level forecasting. Furthermore, we propose tools to take advantage of the RETAIN interpretable nature.

Existing deep learning methods rely on large labeled datasets, inefficient use of unlabeled data, and limited interpretability, restricting clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture coupled with innovative semi-supervised learning (SSL) and explainability techniques to enhance multiclass eye disease classification. Our methodology integrates a ConvNeXt backbone with Transformer modules, leveraging multi-head attention to effectively capture both spatial features and long-range dependencies. We introduce Uncertainty-Guided MixMatch (UG-MixMatch), a semi-supervised framework that leverages Monte Carlo (MC) dropout for uncertainty quantification and pseudo-label refinement, effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. For interpretability, we propose a novel Gradient-based Integrated Attention Map (GIAM), which aggregates attention maps across multiple layers. It incorporates adaptive channel-wise weighting, offering more detailed insights into model predictions, surpassing traditional Grad-CAM methods. Evaluated on the Ocular Imaging Health (OIH) dataset of 4215 fundus images across four classes, our approach achieved a 95.27 % classification accuracy using UG-MixMatch and 95.51 % when incorporating MC dropout for direct model evaluation. Cohen's kappa score reached 93.70, indicating near-perfect agreement with the ground truth. Class-wise performance was exceptional, with 100 % sensitivity and specificity for DR and over 95 % specificity for cataract and glaucoma. Robust AUC values were observed, including 1.00 for DR and cataract and 0.99 for glaucoma and healthy cases. GIAM visualizations effectively highlighted disease-relevant regions, offering enhanced clinical interpretability and validation potential. Our framework addresses data scarcity, enhances interpretability, and delivers clinically relevant performance, a promising step towards scalable, explainable, and accurate diagnostic tools for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and ophthalmic screening."

Lack of effective treatment can lead to vision impairment and even irreversible blindness. The disease can be diagnosed by examining digital color fundus photographs of retina. In this paper we propose deep learning approach to automated diabetic retinopathy screening. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) — the most popular kind of deep learning algorithms — enjoyed great success in the field of image analysis and recognition. Therefore, we leverage CNN networks to diagnose the diabetic retinopathy and its current stage, based on analysis of the photographs of retina. The utilized models were trained using dataset containing over 88000 retina photographs, labeled by specialist clinicians. To enhance the performance of the system, we proposed a special class coding technique that enabled to include the information about value of difference between predicted score and target score into the objective function being minimized during the neural networks training. To evaluate classification ability of employed models we used standard accuracy metrics and quadratic weighted Kappa score that is calculated between the predicted scores and scores provided in the dataset. The best tested model achieved an accuracy of about 82% in detecting the retinopathy and 51% in assessing its stage. Moreover, system obtained decent Kappa score equal 0.776. Achieved results showed that deep learning algorithms can be successfully employed to solve this very hard to analyze problem."

In this article, we aimed to construct a novel multimodal framework based on ECG and PPG signal fusion to establish a universal BG monitoring model. This is proposed as a spatiotemporal decision fusion strategy that uses weight-based Choquet integral for BG monitoring. Specifically, the multimodal framework performs three-level fusion. First, ECG and PPG signals are collected and coupled into different pools. Second, the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features in the ECG and PPG signals are extracted through numerical analysis and residual networks, respectively. Furthermore, the suitable temporal statistical features are determined with three feature selection techniques, and the spatial morphological features are compressed by deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, weight-based Choquet integral multimodel fusion is integrated for coupling different BG monitoring algorithms based on the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features. To verify the feasibility of the model, a total of 103 days of ECG and PPG signals encompassing 21 participants were collected in this article. The BG levels of participants ranged between 2.2 and 21.8 mmol/L. The results obtained show that the proposed model has excellent BG monitoring performance with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.49 mmol/L, mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 13.42%, and Zone A + B of 99.49% in tenfold cross-validation. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed fusion approach for BG monitoring has potentials in practical applications of diabetes management."

Although it cannot be cured, if left unmanaged, diabetes can progressively damage vital organs. Without early and appropriate care, it may lead to multiple adverse effects. To ensure proper care, diabetic individuals typically require regular visits to healthcare professionals. This study proposes a predictive method that empowers diabetic individuals to monitor and manage their blood sugar levels without frequent doctor visits. The central objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the dependence on physician consultations and diagnostic center appointments. To analyze diabetic retinopathy datasets, the proposed system employs Deep Predictive Neural Networks (DPNNs). Retinal lesions are identified using the Region Convergence Algorithm (RCA), and features are extracted using the Strong Intensity Extractor (SIE), which captures significant pixel-level information. Cognitive Computing (CC), integrated with DPNN, is applied to optimize classification accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the Confusion Matrix.

- **Reasoning:** Uses CNN‑BiLSTM‑attention multimodal model to predict interstitial glucose for type‑2 diabetes; integrates health records, shows strong prediction accuracy, limited discussion of interpretability or privacy.","Abstract The accurate prediction of blood glucose is critical for the effective management of diabetes. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population.

Manual diagnosis is a long and expensive process with a specific risk of misdiagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis can provide more accurate and practical treatment recommendations. In this paper, we propose a multi-view joint learning DR diagnostic model called RT2Net, which integrates the global features of fundus images and the local detailed features of vascular images to reduce the limitations of single fundus image learning. Firstly, the original image is preprocessed using operations such as contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization, and the vascular structure of the extracted DR image is segmented. Then, the vascular image and fundus image are input into two branch networks of RT2Net for feature extraction, respectively, and the feature fusion module adaptively fuses the feature vectors' output from the branch networks. Finally, the optimized classification model is used to identify the five categories of DR. This paper conducts extensive experiments on the public datasets EyePACS and APTOS 2019 to demonstrate the method's effectiveness. The accuracy of RT2Net on the two datasets reaches 88.2% and 85.4%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. The excellent classification ability of RT2Net for DR can significantly help patients detect and treat lesions early and provide doctors with a more reliable diagnosis basis, which has significant clinical value for diagnosing DR.

Typically, patients with DR do not show symptoms until later stages, by which time it may be too late to receive effective treatment. DR Grading is challenging because of the small size and variation in lesion patterns. The key to fine-grained DR grading is to discover more discriminating elements such as cotton wool, hard exudates, hemorrhages, microaneurysms etc. Although deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNN) seem ideal for the automated detection of abnormalities in advanced clinical imaging, small-size lesions are very hard to distinguish by using traditional networks. This work proposes a bi-directional spatial and channel-wise parallel attention based network to learn discriminative features for diabetic retinopathy grading. The proposed attention block plugged with a backbone network helps to extract features specific to fine-grained DR-grading. This scheme boosts classification performance along with the detection of small-sized lesion parts. Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used benchmark datasets for DR grading, and performance is evaluated on different quality metrics. Also, for model interpretability, activation maps are generated using the LIME method to visualize the predicted lesion parts. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed IDANet exhibits better performance for DR grading and lesion detection. "

Most of the existing DR image classification methods are based on supervised learning which requires a lot of time-consuming and expensive medical domain experts-annotated data for training. The proposed approach uses the prior learning from the source DR image dataset to classify images drawn from the target datasets. The image representations learned from the unlabeled source domain dataset through contrastive learning are used to classify DR images from the target domain dataset. Moreover, the proposed approach requires a few labeled images to perform successfully on DR image classification tasks in cross-domain settings. The proposed work experiments with four publicly available datasets: EyePACS, APTOS 2019, MESSIDOR-I, and Fundus Images for self-supervised representation learning-based DR image classification in cross-domain settings. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on binary and multi-classification of DR images, even in cross-domain settings.

Diagnosing DR is inherently complex, as it necessitates the meticulous examination of intricate retinal images by experienced specialists. This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing. Remarkably, the DiaCNN model showcased unparalleled precision, achieving 100% accuracy in training and 98.3% in testing. These figures represent a significant leap in classification accuracy when juxtaposed with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Such advancements hold immense promise for the future, emphasizing the potential of our proposed technique to revolutionize the accuracy of DR and other eye disease diagnoses. By facilitating earlier detection and more timely interventions, this approach stands poised to significantly reduce the incidence of blindness associated with DR, thus heralding a new era of improved patient outcomes. Therefore, this work, through its novel approach and stellar results, not only pushes the boundaries of DR diagnostic accuracy but also promises a transformative impact in early detection and intervention, aiming to substantially diminish DR-induced blindness and champion enhanced patient care.

Effective management of blood glucose is essential for individuals with diabetes to mitigate these risks. This study introduces the Glu-Ensemble, a deep learning framework designed for precise blood glucose forecasting in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike other predictive models, Glu-Ensemble addresses challenges related to small sample sizes, data quality issues, reliance on strict statistical assumptions, and the complexity of models. It enhances prediction accuracy and model generalizability by utilizing larger datasets and reduces bias inherent in many predictive models. The framework's unified approach, as opposed to patient-specific models, eliminates the need for initial calibration time, facilitating immediate blood glucose predictions for new patients. The obtained results indicate that Glu-Ensemble surpasses traditional methods in accuracy, as measured by root mean square error, mean absolute error, and error grid analysis. The Glu-Ensemble framework emerges as a promising tool for blood glucose level prediction in type 2 diabetes patients, warranting further investigation in clinical settings for its practical application.

In this study, we considered several well-known DR risk factors and attempted to improve the accuracy of DR screening. Metphods Fusing nonimage data (e.g., age, gender, smoking status, International Classification of Disease code, and laboratory tests) with data from fundus images can enable an end-to-end deep learning architecture for DR screening. We propose a neural network that simultaneously trains heterogeneous data and increases the performance of DR classification in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In the current retrospective study, 13,410 fundus images and their corresponding nonimage data were collected from the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital in Taiwan. The images were classified as either nonreferable or referable for DR by a panel of ophthalmologists. Cross-validation was used for the training models and to evaluate the classification performance. Results The proposed fusion model achieved 97.96% area under the curve with 96.84% sensitivity and 89.44% specificity for determining referable DR from multimodal data, and significantly outperformed the models that used image or nonimage information separately. Conclusions The fusion model with heterogeneous data has the potential to improve referable DR screening performance for earlier referral decisions.

Novel approaches to identify patients at high risk for worsening glycemic control can improve outcomes and contain costs within ACNs. We used XGBoost Decision Trees to build and validate a model predicting worsening glycemic control (HbA1c increase ≥1.5% over 12 months) using Medicare ACN administrative claims and electronic health record data. Eligible members had ≥18 mos. continuous enrollment, were age ≥18 years with Type 1 or 2 diabetes, had ≥2 HbA1c values between 6.5 and 14%, and no disability. Members were split into HbA1c outcome stratified training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets for 10-fold cross-validation. The model utilized 1,490 features including medical history, labs, demographics, SDOH, utilization, and quality of care. Of the 44,007 unique members (mean age 72 years, 51% Female, 61% Non-Hispanic White, mean HbA1c 7.2%, 9% on insulin, HTN 92%, Obesity 71%, CKD 33%, CAD 32%, Heart Failure 15% and COPD 13%), 5.23% had an HbA1c increase ≥1.5% over 12 months. Key features in the final model included duration of diabetes, last HbA1c value, treatment intensification, prescribed insulin or sulfonylureas, weight change, depression, acute renal failure, area deprivation index, and no car access. Model AUC was 0.672 (95% CI ±0.005) in the validation sample. The model was able to identify 23.5% of members with worsening glycemic control in the highest predicted decile of HbA1c progression (sensitivity 23.5% at 10% alert rate). Mean TCOC at 10% alert rate was $43,850 PMPY which was substantially higher than training population at $18,208 PMPY. Our model can identify ACN members with diabetes at high risk for worsening glycemic control that may benefit from education, medication adherence, food insecurity and transportation interventions.

- **Reasoning:** Uses transfer learning CNNs to detect neovascularization in diabetic fundus images, achieving high accuracy; lacks interpretability, bias analysis, and multimodal or federated components.","Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing a retinal disorder called Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). One of the main characteristics of PDR is the development of neovascularization, a condition in which abnormal blood vessels are formed on the retina. This condition can cause blindness if it is not detected and treated early. Numerous studies have proposed different image processing techniques for detecting neovascularization in fundus images. However, because of its random growth pattern and small size, neovascularization remains challenging to detect. Hence, deep learning techniques are becoming more prevalent in neovascularization identification because of their ability to perform automatic feature extraction on objects with complex features. In this paper, a method of neovascularization detection based on transfer learning is proposed. The performance of the transfer learning method is investigated using four pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which include AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet18, and ResNet50. In addition, an improved network based on the combination of ResNet18 and GoogLeNet is proposed. Evaluation on 1174 retinal image patches showed that the proposed network could achieve 91.57%, 85.69%, 97.44%, and 97.10% of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, respectively. We demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms each individual CNN for neovascularization detection. It also shows better performance compared to another method that utilized deep learning models for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification."

Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture VGG16 was employed for this study. A transfer learning process was implemented to re-train the CNN for robust OCTA classification. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of using this method for artificial intelligence (AI) screening of DR in clinical environments, the re-trained CNN was incorporated into a custom developed GUI platform which can be readily operated by ophthalmic personnel. Results: With last nine layers re-trained, CNN architecture achieved the best performance for automated OCTA classification. The overall accuracy of the re-trained classifier for differentiating healthy, NoDR, and NPDR was 87.27%, with 83.76% sensitivity and 90.82% specificity. The AUC metrics for binary classification of healthy, NoDR and DR were 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively.

These algorithms have shown high sensitivity and specificity for detecting DR in non-clinical setup. Transfer learning has been successfully tested in many medical imaging applications like skin cancer detection, pulmonary nodule detection, Alzheimer’s disease etc. This paper experiments with the different DL architectures such as VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, MobileNet and NASNet for automated DR classification (binary and multi class) on Messidor dataset. The dataset is publicly available, and comprises of 1200 retinal fundus images. The images belong to four different classes of DR namely, normal (class 0), mild (class 1), moderate (class 2) and severe (class 3), graded based on the severity level of DR. In our experiment, we have enhanced the quality of input images by applying algorithms like CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation) algorithm and Powerlaw transformation as pre-processing techniques, which work on the small image patches with high accuracy, contrast limiting and image sharpening. Hyper parameter tuning on pretrained InceptionV3 architecture, resulted in enhancing the accuracy of the model. Both binary and multi class results were analysed considering inter class (one class with another class) accuracies. We achieved an accuracy of 78% between class 0 and class 1, the accuracy between class 0 and class 2 further reduced to 69%, while class 1 and class 2 showed an accuracy of 61%. Moreover, the interclass class accuracy between class 1 and class 3 was 62%, class 2 and class 3 further reduced to 49%. The accuracy further diminished between class 0 and class 3 to 32%. These experiments suggest that the pretrained models provided better results in classifying normal and mild, but they were not that much efficient in classifying moderate-severe and normal-severe binary classifications."

Since early detection and classification could diminish the visual impairment, it is significant to develop an automated DR diagnosis method.

The availability of annotated training datasets is considered a core issue for implementing deep learning in the classification of medical images. The models based on transfer learning are widely adopted by the researchers to overcome annotated data insufficiency problems and computational overhead. In the proposed study, features are extracted from fundus images using the pre-trained network VGGNet and combined with the concept of transfer learning to improve classification performance. To deal with data insufficiency and unbalancing problems, we employed various data augmentation operations differently on each grade of DR.

Early detection and treatment of DR can salvage from visual impairment. The manual screening of DR is a very laborious and time-intensive effort and heavily dependent on professional ophthalmologists. In addition, the subtle distinction among various retinal biomarkers and different grades of DR makes this recognition very challenging. To address the aforementioned problem, deep neural networks have brought many revolutions in the last few years. In this study, we proposed a novel two-stage framework for automatic DR classification. In the first stage, we employed two distinct U-Net models for optic disc (OD) and blood vessel (BV) segmentation during the preprocessing. In the second stage, the enhanced retinal images after OD and BV extraction are used as an input of transfer learning-based model VGGNet, which performs DR detection by identifying retinal biomarkers such as microaneurysms (MA), haemorrhages (HM), and exudates (EX). The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 96.60%, 93.95%, 92.25% evaluated on EyePACS-1, Messidor-2, and DIARETDB0, respectively. Extensive experiments and comparison with baseline methods demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Various machine learning models and methods have been proposed in the recent past to predict diabetes disease. Still, these systems cannot handle the massive number of multifeatures datasets on diabetes disease properly. A smart healthcare recommendation system is proposed for diabetes disease based on deep machine learning and data fusion perspectives. Using data fusion, we can eliminate the irrelevant burden of system computational capabilities and increase the proposed system’s performance to predict and recommend this life-threatening disease more accurately. Finally, the ensemble machine learning model is trained for diabetes prediction. This intelligent recommendation system is evaluated based on a well-known diabetes dataset, and its performance is compared with the most recent developments from the literature. The proposed system achieved 99.6% accuracy, which is higher compared to the existing deep machine learning methods. Therefore, our proposed system is better for multidisciplinary diabetes disease prediction and recommendation. Our proposed system’s improved disease diagnosis performance advocates for its employment in the automated diagnostic and recommendation systems for diabetic patients."

- **Reasoning:** Uses hybrid deep learning‑Gaussian process model for retinal fundus image DR detection, adds uncertainty quantification for interpretability, but lacks multimodal, federated, bias, or transfer learning components.","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the microvascular complications of Diabetes Mellitus, which remains as one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Computational models based on Convolutional Neural Networks represent the state of the art for the automatic detection of DR using eye fundus images. Most of the current work address this problem as a binary classification task. However, including the grade estimation and quantification of predictions uncertainty can potentially increase the robustness of the model. In this paper, a hybrid Deep Learning-Gaussian process method for DR diagnosis and uncertainty quantification is presented. This method combines the representational power of deep learning, with the ability to generalize from small datasets of Gaussian process models. The results show that uncertainty quantification in the predictions improves the interpretability of the method as a diagnostic support tool.

Early and accurate diagnosis of the disease is essential for successful treatment. This paper introduces a deep learning method for the detection and stage grading of diabetic retinopathy, using a single fundus retinal image. Our model utilizes transfer learning, employing two state-of-the-art pre-trained models as feature extractors and fine-tuning them on a new dataset. The proposed model is trained on a large multi-center dataset, including the APTOS 2019 dataset, obtained from publicly available sources. It achieves remarkable performance in diabetic retinopathy detection and stage classification on the APTOS 2019, outperforming the established literature. For binary classification, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 98.50, a sensitivity of 99.46, and a specificity of 97.51. In stage grading, it achieves a quadratic weighted kappa of 93.00, an accuracy of 89.60, a sensitivity of 89.60, and a specificity of 97.72.

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep reinforcement learning for insulin/glucagon dosing in T1D, directly applying AI to diabetes control; includes population-to-personalization training, but lacks interpretability, bias analysis, imaging, or federated learning.","People with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) require regular exogenous infusion of insulin to maintain their blood glucose concentration in a therapeutically adequate target range. Although the artificial pancreas and continuous glucose monitoring have been proven to be effective in achieving closed-loop control, significant challenges still remain due to the high complexity of glucose dynamics and limitations in the technology. In this work, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning model for single-hormone (insulin) and dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) delivery. In particular, the delivery strategies are developed by double Q-learning with dilated recurrent neural networks. For designing and testing purposes, the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova Type 1 simulator was employed. First, we performed long-term generalized training to obtain a population model. Then, this model was personalized with a small data-set of subject-specific data. In silico results show that the single and dual-hormone delivery strategies achieve good glucose control when compared to a standard basal-bolus therapy with low-glucose insulin suspension. Specifically, in the adult cohort (n=10), percentage time in target range [70, 180] mg/dL improved from 77.6% to 80.9% with single-hormone control, and to $85.6\%$ with dual-hormone control. In the adolescent cohort (n=10), percentage time in target range improved from 55.5% to 65.9% with single-hormone control, and to 78.8% with dual-hormone control. In all scenarios, a significant decrease in hypoglycemia was observed. These results show that the use of deep reinforcement learning is a viable approach for closed-loop glucose control in T1D."

Because the images must be interpreted by a medical expert, it is infeasible to screen all individuals with diabetes for diabetic retinopathy. Deep learning has shown impressive results for automatic analysis and grading of fundus images. One drawback is, however, the lack of interpretability, which hampers the implementation of such systems in the clinic. Explainable artificial intelligence methods can be applied to explain the deep neural networks. Explanations based on concepts have shown to be intuitive for humans to understand, but have not yet been explored in detail for diabetic retinopathy grading. This work investigates and compares two concept-based explanation techniques for explaining deep neural networks developed for automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy: Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors and Concept Bottleneck Models. We found that both methods have strengths and weaknesses, and choice of method should take the available data and the end user's preferences into account."

In Phase 1, a unique wireless communication model is created to assure the accurate transfer of real-time patient data from wearable devices to medical centers. Using Lagrange optimization, the model identifies the best transmission distance and power needs, lowering energy usage while preserving communication dependability. This contribution is especially essential since effective data transport is a necessary condition for continuous monitoring in large-scale healthcare systems. In Phase 2, the transmitted multimodal clinical, genetic, and lifestyle data are evaluated using a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.

In the literature, researchers have focused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms and convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on essential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance. In this study, we adopt and fine-tune transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial features of retinal images for a more nuanced understanding of DR severity. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of image transformers to infer the degree of DR severity from fundus photographs.

Although clinical manifestations of DKD are similar in T1D and T2D, the structural lesions may differ, and it remains unclear whether DKD in T1D and T2D represent distinct diseases. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to build machine learning (ML) models using clinical and kidney MRI data to classify diabetes status, as well as structural and functional kidney differences of individuals with T1D versus T2D. We hypothesize that a highly accurate multimodal neural network can be constructed that integrates clinical and functional kidney MRI images.Data were obtained from several studies at University of Colorado in youth with T1D (n=102), T2D (n=91) as well as non-diabetic controls (n=60). A total of 253 participants were included in the analyses. First, we applied to clinical data (CASPER, IMPROVE-T2D, CROCODILE, and RENAL-HEIR trials) logistic regression and 7 ML models: extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), XGBoost with grid search, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, and a 3-layer neural network (NN-EHR). When a small subset of the clinical data was used as features, the NN-EHR yielded the highest accuracy of 84%. Next, we considered the MRI images (27,000 images from the 253 individuals). We applied three convoluted NN to perform the classification: AlexNet, VGG16, and a 4-layer Neural Network for Diabetes Detection (NN4DD). Considering the images alone, VGG16 and NN4DD both achieved an accuracy of > 80%. Additionally, by integrating the clinical data and the MRI images, the fusion neural network achieved an accuracy of almost 100%. Finally, an interpretability analysis of NN4DD indicated notable differences in kidney structure and function among the three groups.Although the cost of MRI is prohibitive and thus impractical for diabetes diagnosis, these results provide a proof-of-concept that fused neural networks that integrate multimodal data can be a valuable diagnostic tool, and provide structural and functional insight on kidney differences between T1D and T2D.

DR can cause irreversible vision loss and low vision. DR classification, that is, early DR diagnosis and accurate DR grading, is critical for vision protection and immediate treatment. Deep learning-based automated systems led to significant expectations for DR classification based on fundus images with several advantages. In the past several years, many outstanding studies in this area have been conducted and several review articles have been published. However, the new trends and the future directions are need to furtherly analyzed. Thus, we carefully included and read 94 related articles published from 2018 to 2023 through Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. From this review, we found that transfer learning has been used as an outstanding strategy for overcoming the issue of the limited data resources to support DR analysis. CNN models of ResNet and VGGNet with layers of tens or even hundreds are the most popular frameworks used for DR classification. The APTOS 2019 and EyePACS are the most widely used datasets for DR classification. In addition, some lightweight DL architectures like SqueezeNet and MobileNet have been proposed for DR classification tasks, especially for limited data resources and computational capabilities. Although deep learning has achieved or surpassed human-level accuracy in DR classification, there is still a long way to go in real clinical workflows. Further improvements in model interpretability, trustworthiness from ophthalmologists, cost-effective and reliable DR screening systems are needed."

DR is an ocular disease that affects the retina in people with diabetes and could lead to visual impairment if management measures are not taken in a timely manner. In DR screening programs, the presence and severity of DR are identified and classified based on various microvascular lesions detected by qualified ophthalmic screeners. Such a detection process is time-consuming and error-prone, given the small size of the microvascular lesions and the volume of images, especially with the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Automated image processing using deep learning methods is recognized as a promising approach to support diabetic retinopathy screening. In this paper, we propose a novel compound scaling encoder-decoder network architecture to improve the accuracy and running efficiency of microvascular lesion segmentation. In the encoder phase, we develop a lightweight encoder to speed up the training process, where the encoder network is scaled up in depth, width, and resolution dimensions. In the decoder phase, an attention mechanism is introduced to yield higher accuracy. Specifically, we employ Concurrent Spatial and Channel Squeeze and Channel Excitation (scSE) blocks to fully utilise both spatial and channel-wise information. Additionally, a compound loss function is incorporated with transfer learning to handle the problem of imbalanced data and further improve performance. To assess performance, our method is evaluated on two large-scale lesion segmentation datasets: DDR and FGADR datasets.

If an early prognostication of DR is not done, then it may lead to loss of vision. Some of the diagnosing tools for detection of DR are Indirect Ophthalmoscope, Slit Lamp Examination, Color Photograph, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The DR dataset contains 5 types of lesions ranging from mild to severe. These lesions are hard to distinguish from each other. The manual diagnosis of DR involves the proper classification of these lesions into their appropriate classes that is quite tedious and error-prone process marred with low level of accuracies. Researchers therefore rely on automatic detection and prognosis of DR based on Machine Learning (ML) methods. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) framework to classify these lesions with high level of accuracy. To accomplish the task, we train a DL model Visual Geometry Group (VGG19) on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) dataset to extract the features from the color fundus eye photography provided in the dataset. The extracted features are then fed into different classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) etc. to classify the lesions properly. We thus show, that using DL along with Transfer Learning (TL) can classify the affected areas such as Microaneurysms (MA), Soft Exudates (SE), Hard Exudates (EX), and Hemorrhage (HE) of a DR eye with high accuracy."

Glucose prediction algorithms commonly rely on black-box models. Large physiological models, successfully adopted for simulation, were little explored for glucose prediction, mostly because their parameters are hard to individualize.

Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have become important tools for providing estimates of glucose to patients with diabetes. Recently, neural networks (NNs) have become a common method for forecasting glucose values using data from CGMs. One method of forecasting glucose values is a time-delay feedforward (FF) NN, but a change in the CGM location on a participant can increase forecast error in a FF NN.


METHODS
In response, we examined a NN with gated recurrent units (GRUs) as a method of reducing forecast error due to changes in sensor location.


RESULTS
We observed that for 13 participants with type 2 diabetes wearing blinded CGMs on both arms for 12 weeks (FreeStyle Libre Pro-Abbott), GRU NNs did not produce significantly different errors in glucose prediction due to sensor location changes (P < .05).


CONCLUSION
We observe that GRU NNs can mitigate error in glucose prediction due to differences in CGM location."

The existing diagnostic paradigm for diabetic retinopathy (DR) greatly relies on subjective assessments by medical practitioners utilizing optical imaging, introducing susceptibility to individual interpretation. This work presents a novel system for the early detection and grading of DR, providing an automated alternative to the manual examination.


APPROACH
First, we use advanced image preprocessing techniques, specifically contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Gaussian filtering, with the goal of enhancing image quality and module learning capabilities. Second, a deep learning-based automatic detection system is developed. The system consists of a feature segmentation module, a deep learning feature extraction module, and an ensemble classification module. The feature segmentation module accomplishes vascular segmentation, the deep learning feature extraction module realizes the global feature and local feature extraction of retinopathy images, and the ensemble module performs the diagnosis and classification of DR for the extracted features. Lastly, nine performance evaluation metrics are applied to assess the quality of the model's performance.


MAIN RESULTS
Extensive experiments are conducted on four retinal image databases (APTOS 2019, Messidor, DDR, and EyePACS). The proposed method demonstrates promising performance in the binary and multi-classification tasks for DR, evaluated through nine indicators, including AUC and quadratic weighted Kappa score. The system shows the best performance in the comparison of three segmentation methods, two convolutional neural network architecture models, four Swin Transformer structures, and the latest literature methods.


SIGNIFICANCE
In contrast to existing methods, our system demonstrates superior performance across multiple indicators, enabling accurate screening of DR and providing valuable support to clinicians in the diagnostic process. Our automated approach minimizes the reliance on subjective assessments, contributing to more consistent and reliable DR evaluations."

It causes vision problems and blindness due to disfigurement of human retina. According to statistics, 80% of diabetes patients battling from long diabetic period of 15 to 20 years, suffer from DR. Hence, it has become a dangerous threat to the health and life of people. To overcome DR, manual diagnosis of the disease is feasible but overwhelming and cumbersome at the same time and hence requires a revolutionary method. Thus, such a health condition necessitates primary recognition and diagnosis to prevent DR from developing into severe stages and prevent blindness. Innumerable Machine Learning (ML) models are proposed by researchers across the globe, to achieve this purpose. Various feature extraction techniques are proposed for extraction of DR features for early detection. However, traditional ML models have shown either meagre generalization throughout feature extraction and classification for deploying smaller datasets or consumes more of training time causing inefficiency in prediction while using larger datasets. Hence Deep Learning (DL), a new domain of ML, is introduced. DL models can handle a smaller dataset with help of efficient data processing techniques. However, they generally incorporate larger datasets for their deep architectures to enhance performance in feature extraction and image classification. This paper gives a detailed review on DR, its features, causes, ML models, state-of-the-art DL models, challenges, comparisons and future directions, for early detection of DR. "

Reviews many DL methods but lacks original clinical deployment or bias analysis; mentions transfer learning and interpretability.","Abstract The severe progression of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) stands out as one of the most significant concerns for healthcare officials worldwide. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication associated with diabetes, particularly affecting individuals between the ages of 18 and 65. As per the findings of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, 35–60% of individuals suffering from DR possess a diabetes history. DR emerges as a leading cause of worldwide visual impairment. Due to the absence of ophthalmologists worldwide, insufficient health resources, and healthcare services, patients cannot get timely eye screening services. Automated computer-aided detection of DR provides a wide range of potential benefits. In contrast to traditional observer-driven techniques, automatic detection allows for a more objective analysis of numerous images in a shorter time. Moreover, Unsupervised Learning (UL) holds a high potential for image classification in healthcare, particularly regarding explainability and interpretability. Many studies on the detection of DR with both supervised and unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) methodologies are available. Surprisingly, none of the reviews presented thus far have highlighted the potential benefits of both supervised and unsupervised DL methods in Medical Imaging for the detection of DR. After a rigorous selection process, 103 articles were retrieved from four diverse and well-known databases (Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE). This review provides a comprehensive summary of both supervised and unsupervised DL methods applied in DR detection, explaining the significant benefits of both techniques and covering aspects such as datasets, pre-processing, segmentation techniques, and supervised and unsupervised DL methods for detection. The insights from this review will aid academics and researchers in medical imaging to make informed decisions and choose the best practices for DR detection. "

DR causes impaired vision and may even lead to blindness if it is not diagnosed in early stages. DR has five stages or classes, namely normal, mild, moderate, severe and PDR (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy). Normally, highly trained experts examine the colored fundus images to diagnose this fatal disease. This manual diagnosis of this condition (by clinicians) is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, various computer vision-based techniques have been proposed to automatically detect DR and its different stages from retina images. However, these methods are unable to encode the underlying complicated features and can only classify DR's different stages with very low accuracy particularly, for the early stages. In this research, we used the publicly available Kaggle dataset of retina images to train an ensemble of five deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models (Resnet50, Inceptionv3, Xception, Dense121, Dense169) to encode the rich features and improve the classification for different stages of DR. The experimental results show that the proposed model detects all the stages of DR unlike the current methods and performs better compared to state-of-the-art methods on the same Kaggle dataset."

Since DR is often asymptomatic in its early stage, timely diagnosis is crucial. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to facilitate early disease detection and treatment, but its implementation in the medical field raises significant privacy concerns. The sensitive nature of healthcare data, which includes personal information and medical history, makes data privacy a critical issue. This paper explores the implementation of AI models to predict DR risks while incorporating common defense algorithms to enhance data privacy. An unstructured dataset, specifically the DDR dataset, was used to train Deep Learning (DL) models. Two families of DL models, ResNets and DenseNets, were trained and evaluated based on the performance metrics. ResNet 50 and DenseNet 169 demonstrated superior performance and were selected for further privacy enhancement using encryption. The results indicated that privacy-preserving methods, particularly encryption, did not significantly impact the model performance.

Many factors can cause a person to get affected by diabetes, like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, family history, physical inactivity, bad food habit etc. Increased urination is one of the most common symptoms of this disease. People with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been developed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and collected additional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in Bangladesh. Feature selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in this work. A semi-supervised model with extreme gradient boosting has been utilized to predict the insulin features of the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN approaches have been employed to manage the class imbalance problem. The authors used machine learning classification methods, that is, decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensemble techniques, to determine which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The explainable AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to understand how the model predicts the final results.

Leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) Models as methods of prediction of future glucose levels, gives rise to substantial quality of life improvements, as well as providing a vital tool for monitoring diabetes.
  A regression based prediction approach is implemented recursively, with a series of Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Hidden Markov Model, Long-Short Term Memory Network. By exploiting a patient's past 11 hours of blood glucose (BG) concentration measurements, a prediction of the 60 minutes is made. Results will be assessed using performance metrics including: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), normalised energy of the second-order differences (ESOD) and F1 score.
  Research of past and current approaches, as well as available dataset, led to the establishment of an optimal training methodology for the CITY dataset, which may be leveraged by future model development. Performance was aligned with similar state-of-art ML models, with LSTM having RMSE of 28.55, however no significant advantage was observed over classical Auto-regressive AR models. Compelling insights into LSTM prediction behaviour could increase public and legislative trust and understanding, progressing the certification of ML models in Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS)."

- **Reasoning:** Uses ensemble of pretrained CNNs to grade diabetic retinopathy from UW‑OCTA images, directly applying deep learning to a diabetes‑specific imaging task. Lacks interpretability, bias analysis, and federated learning components.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes, and one of the major causes of vision impairment in the global population. As the early-stage manifestation of DR is usually very mild and hard to detect, an accurate diagnosis via eye-screening is clinically important to prevent vision loss at later stages. In this work, we propose an ensemble method to automatically grade DR using ultra-wide optical coherence tomography angiography (UW-OCTA) images available from Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Challenge (DRAC) 2022. First, we adopt the state-of-the-art classification networks, i.e., ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and VGG, and train them to grade UW-OCTA images with different splits of the available dataset. Ultimately, we obtain 25 models, of which, the top 16 models are selected and ensembled to generate the final predictions. During the training process, we also investigate the multi-task learning strategy, and add an auxiliary classification task, the Image Quality Assessment, to improve the model performance. Our final ensemble model achieved a quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9346 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.9766 on the internal testing dataset, and the QWK of 0.839 and the AUC of 0.8978 on the DRAC challenge testing dataset."

Deep neural networks have been widely used in automated systems for DR classification on eye fundus images. However, these models need a large number of annotated images. In the medical domain, annotations from experts are costly, tedious, and time-consuming; as a result, a limited number of annotated images are available. This paper presents a semi-supervised method that leverages unlabeled images and labeled ones to train a model that detects diabetic retinopathy. The proposed method uses unsupervised pretraining via self-supervised learning followed by supervised fine-tuning with a small set of labeled images and knowledge distillation to increase the performance in classification task. This method was evaluated on the EyePACS test and Messidor-2 dataset achieving 0.94 and 0.89 AUC respectively using only 2% of EyePACS train labeled images."

However, current clinical screening methods for GDM still exhibit limitations in detection speed, sensitivity and convenience, making it difficult to meet the clinical demand for rapid early-pregnancy screening. To address this, we propose a novel strategy for early GDM diagnosis based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with deep learning, aiming to achieve rapid and accurate early screening. Characteristic SERS spectra of serum were obtained using a substrate based on silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). A fused PCA-CNN model integrating principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for feature learning was developed. The PCA-CNN model effectively extracts potential biomarker features from serum SERS spectra, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 93.7%, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the entire detection process can be completed within 30 min, requires about 2.5 μL of serum per sample, and involves minimal preprocessing, highlighting both efficiency and practicality. This study provides a novel method for early GDM screening that combines high diagnostic performance with clinical applicability, offering promising technical support for early intervention and clinical management of GDM."

Effective management of T1D greatly benefits from constant monitoring of BG levels, achievable in real-time using minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. These devices provide data streams that can be leveraged by forecasting algorithms to predict BG levels minutes in advance, enabling timely therapeutic interventions to prevent adverse events, such as hypo/hyperglycemia. With the increasing availability of data, deep learning (DL) algorithms have emerged as the state-of-the-art for BG forecasting, owing to their ability to autonomously learn complex nonlinear relationships, such as those underlying the glucoregulatory system. Despite a growing body of research, a comprehensive review specifically focusing on DL applications for BG prediction is still lacking. To address this gap, a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, involving extensive searches across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. A total of 26 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and were evaluated based on dataset characteristics, model inputs, training paradigm, prediction horizon, model architecture, evaluation metrics, performance, and baseline comparators. While DL models show great promise, several challenges persist-particularly in ensuring physiological fidelity and interpretability, both essential for clinical adoption. To overcome these barriers, future research should prioritize the integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve model reliability and safety, ultimately supporting the effective deployment of DL models in real-time T1D management."

One of the signs of diabetes is Diabetic Retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is the most prevalent type of diabetes, if remains unaddressed, diabetic retinopathy can affect all diabetics and become very serious, raising the chances of blindness. It is a chronic systemic condition that affects up to 80% of patients for more than ten years. Many researchers believe that if diabetes individuals are diagnosed early enough, they can be rescued from the condition in 90% of cases. Diabetes damages the capillaries, which are microscopic blood vessels in the retina. On images, blood vessel damage is usually noticeable. Therefore, in this study, several traditional, as well as deep learning-based approaches, are reviewed for the classification and detection of this particular diabetic-based eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy, and also the advantage of one approach over the other is also described. Along with the approaches, the dataset and the evaluation metrics useful for DR detection and classification are also discussed. The main finding of this study is to aware researchers about the different challenges occurs while detecting diabetic retinopathy using computer vision, deep learning techniques. Therefore, a purpose of this review paper is to sum up all the major aspects while detecting DR like lesion identification, classification and segmentation, security attacks on the deep learning models, proper categorization of datasets and evaluation metrics. As deep learning models are quite expensive and more prone to security attacks thus, in future it is advisable to develop a refined, reliable and robust model which overcomes all these aspects which are commonly found while designing deep learning models.

However, identifying rare events like hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia remain challenging due to their infrequency. Moreover, limited access to sensitive patient data hampers the development of robust machine learning models. Our objective is to accurately predict glycemic excursions while addressing data privacy concerns. To tackle excursion prediction, we propose a novel Hypo-Hyper (HH) loss function, which significantly improves performance in the glycemic excursion regions. The HH loss function demonstrates a 46% improvement over mean-squared error (MSE) loss across 125 patients. To address privacy concerns, we propose FedGlu, a machine learning model trained in a federated learning (FL) framework. FL allows collaborative learning without sharing sensitive data by training models locally and sharing only model parameters across other patients. FedGlu achieves a 35% superior glycemic excursion detection rate compared to local models. This improvement translates to enhanced performance in predicting both, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, for 105 out of 125 patients. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed HH loss function in augmenting the predictive capabilities of glucose predictions. Moreover, implementing models within a federated learning framework not only ensures better predictive capabilities but also safeguards sensitive data concurrently."

However, manual image reading is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and different doctors may make different diagnoses. At present, intelligent grading based on deep learning has become a hotspot in DR intelligent diagnosis. The existing DR intelligent classification model based on convolutional neural network has achieved good results, but the relationship between the deep features proposed by the network is not considered, while this relationship contains important classification information. In order to overcome the above-mentioned shortcoming of convolutional networks, this article draws on the powerful relationship capture capabilities of graph neural networks and proposes a new DR intelligent classification model. The model is composed of two cascaded networks. The convolutional neural network is used to extract the deep features of the DR image, and the graph neural network is used to further capture the relationship between the deep features of the convolutional network. Finally, the two network outputs are fused by adaptive weight, and give the grading result of the entire network. The proposed model is evaluated on the APTOS2019 and Messidor-2 datasets. Compared with other models, the grading accuracy and F1-score of the proposed model on APTOS2019 are improved by 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively.

On the other hand, the computer-based model is suggested to detect the DR. Nevertheless, these methods are most cost and computationally effective and behinds with feature representation, futile to classify the diseases. To conquer against these shortcomings, a novel DR diagnosis model is proposed using a hybrid heuristic-aided deep learning model with fundus images.

Early detection of exudates is critical to avoiding vision problems through continuous screening and treatment. In traditional clinical practice, the involved lesions are manually detected using photographs of the fundus. However, this task is cumbersome and time-consuming and requires intense effort due to the small size of the lesion and the low contrast of the images. Thus, computer-assisted diagnosis of retinal disease based on the detection of red lesions has been actively explored recently. In this paper, we present a comparison of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and propose a residual CNN with residual skip connections to reduce the parameter for the semantic segmentation of exudates in retinal images. A suitable image augmentation technique is used to improve the performance of network architecture. The proposed network can robustly segment exudates with high accuracy, which makes it suitable for diabetic retinopathy screening. A comparative performance analysis of three benchmark databases: E-ophtha, DIARETDB1, and Hamilton Ophthalmology Institute's Macular Edema, is presented.

Machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence are some of the most important tools used for the prediction/detection of diabetes using different types of physiological signals. In this study, we have focused on using multiple sensors such as glucose, electrocardiogram (ECG), accelerometer (ACC), and breathing sensors for classifying patients with diabetes disease. We analyzed whether a single sensor or multiple sensors can predict diabetes well. We identified various time-domain and interval-based features that are used for predicting diabetes and also the optimal window size for the feature calculation. We found that a multisensor combination using glucose, ECG, and ACC sensors gives the highest prediction accuracy of 98.2% with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Moreover, multisensor prediction shows nearly 4%–5% increase in the diabetes prediction rates as compared to single sensors. We observed that breathing-sensor-related data have very little influence on the prediction of diabetes. We also used the score-fit-times curve as one of the metrics for the evaluation of models. From the performance curves, we observed that three-sensor combinations using glucose, ECG, and ACC converge faster as compared to a four-sensor combination while achieving with same accuracy."

This work proposes a novel method for automatically segmenting the blood vessels and classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using fundus images.

The main aim here is to detect any pathological changes happening in the retinal vascular structure for the development of DR, through which the patients can avoid undergoing expensive scans. The proposed system involves three different stages, including pre-processing, vessel segmentation, and classification. The input images are processed first to eliminate the noise, followed by green channel extraction and enhancement with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and gamma correction. Retinal Vascular Structure (RVS) segmentation is a major concern in this work as it is responsible for detecting the different stages of DR by detecting the presence of microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and exudates. The U-Net is used as a base architecture to develop the segmentation model. The contracting path in the U-Net contains four consecutive downsampling and upsampling layers with skip connections. After performing downsampling four times, information on the tiny blood vessels may be missed. Therefore, ResEAD2Net is introduced in this work, where the number of downsampling and upsampling layers is reduced to two instead of four, and two such contracting paths and expansion paths are added to the network. Thus, detailed semantic information can be retained with this structure. Residual blocks are included instead of convolution blocks to increase the computational speed. To include structural connectivity, the segmented output is passed through the proposed Regularized Random Walker (RRW) algorithm, which focuses on the broken blood vessels. Finally, the features are extracted from the vessel structure and passed through the Machine Learning (ML) classifier to predict the DR grading. The proposed method achieves better performance in segmentation with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve values of 98.07%, 90.24%, 99.01%, and 97.51%, respectively, for the STARE dataset and 97.55, 90.07, 98.01, and 97.64, respectively, for the DRIVE dataset. It is also found that the features obtained from the segmentation and ML classifier outperforms the existing methods in multiclass classification by achieving accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.88%, 98.91%, and 98.29% with the Messidor-2 dataset.

This study analyzes a clinical dataset of 253,680 patients from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The dataset encompasses 21 predictors, including high blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), smoking, stroke, heart disease, physical activity, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, insurance coverage, lack of medical visits due to financial constraints, general health, days with mental health issues, days with physical injuries in the past 30 days, difficulties in walking, gender, age, income, and education level. The objective is to balance the training dataset, compare different supervised machine learning models, and identify critical clinical features contributing to diabetes using unsupervised feature selection methods. A total of 34 machine learning models in MATLAB2023a were trained and compared. Quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), Coarse Gaussian SVM, and Narrow Neural Networks achieved the highest training accuracy (76.3%), while the Bilayered Neural Network attained 74.7% on an unseen test dataset. Among all, Quadratic SVM demonstrated the best overall performance based on average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Feature selection highlighted nine key predictors: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, BMI, heart disease, physical activity, general health, recent bodily injuries, mobility issues, and age. A model trained on these features achieved a commendable accuracy of 75.4%, demonstrating the feasibility of a simplified, efficient diagnostic tool with a diagnostic efficacy of 0.7. This study underscores the potential of streamlined models to predict diabetes with fewer parameters while maintaining high accuracy, offering a valuable tool for healthcare diagnostics. "

Machine learning has been applied to health screening records to predict asymptomatic patients' future medical states. However, for medical researchers and physicians, it is crucial to know why machine learning methods made such predictions to understand the underlying mechanism of the disease and prescribe treatments; therefore, predictions must be interpretable. We investigated the ability of an attentional neural network that processes tabular data, namely TabNet, to determine attributes that contribute to making predictions of the aggravation of type 2 diabetes. We used both model-agnostic and model-specific interpretation methods. For the former, we tested SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). For the latter, we used model-specific feature importance and the mask in the attentive transformer of TabNet. We found that this mask provides useful information regarding which items in a biochemical analysis affect the aggravation of type 2 diabetes.

Deep neural networks, on the other hand, have brought many breakthroughs in various tasks in the recent years. To automate the diagnosis of DR and provide appropriate suggestions to DR patients, we have built a dataset of DR fundus images that have been labeled by the proper treatment method that is required. Using this dataset, we trained deep convolutional neural network models to grade the severities of DR fundus images. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 88.72% for a four-degree classification task in the experiments.

- **Reasoning:** Uses LSTM models and SHAP for explainable glucose prediction in T1D, directly supporting decision‑support systems; lacks multimodal, federated, imaging, bias, or transfer‑learning components.","Abstract Machine learning has become a popular tool for learning models of complex dynamics from biomedical data. In Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, these models are increasingly been integrated in decision support systems (DSS) to forecast glucose levels and provide preventive therapeutic suggestions, like corrective insulin boluses (CIB), accordingly. Typically, models are chosen based on their prediction accuracy. However, since patient safety is a concern in this application, the algorithm should also be physiologically sound and its outcome should be explainable. This paper aims to discuss the importance of using tools to interpret the output of black-box models in T1D management by presenting a case-of-study on the selection of the best prediction algorithm to integrate in a DSS for CIB suggestion. By retrospectively “replaying” real patient data, we show that two long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM) (named p-LSTM and np-LSTM) with similar prediction accuracy could lead to different therapeutic decisions. An analysis with SHAP—a tool for explaining black-box models’ output—unambiguously shows that only p-LSTM learnt the physiological relationship between inputs and glucose prediction, and should therefore be preferred. This is verified by showing that, when embedded in the DSS, only p-LSTM can improve patients’ glycemic control. "

Among all predictive modeling approaches, machine learning methods often achieve the highest prediction accuracy, but suffer from a long-standing open problem precluding their widespread use in healthcare. Most machine learning models give no explanation for their prediction results, whereas interpretability is essential for a predictive model to be adopted in typical healthcare settings. Methods: This paper presents the first complete method for automatically explaining results for any machine learning predictive model without degrading accuracy. We did a computer coding implementation of the method. Using the electronic medical record data set from the Practice Fusion diabetes classification competition containing patient records from all 50 states in the United States, we demonstrated the method on predicting type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year. Results: For the champion machine learning model of the competition, our method explained prediction results for 87.4% of patients who were correctly predicted by the model to have type 2 diabetes diagnosis within the next year.

- **Reasoning:** Uses a quantum‑enhanced denoising autoencoder to improve retinal fundus image quality for diabetic retinopathy screening, directly applying AI to a diabetes‑related imaging task; includes limited discussion of clinical deployment but lacks multimodal, federated, bias, or transfer‑learning components.","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a critical source of blindness that can be prevented globally, and accurate analysis of retinal fundus images enables early detection. Fundus images are often affected by multiple noise sources, which impair image quality and hinder the observation of delicate retinal structures, including microaneurysms and small blood vessels. Deep learning driven denoising models are computationally intensive and prone to overfitting on small medical datasets. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the present paper suggests a Quantum Denoising Autoencoder (QDAE), a hybrid quantum-classical architecture, which uses convolutional feature coding with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in latent space. The suggested QDAE applies quantum superposition and entanglement to improve the latent representations, thereby improving denoising and retinal detail preservation. Experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy 224 × 224 (2019) dataset show that QDAE performs considerably better than classical denoising architectures, including CAE, ResNet, and DnCNN with PSNR of 38.8 dB, SSIM of 0.96, and AMI of 0.88. The approach preserves delicate retinal patterns and intensity consistency, while incurring a slight computational overhead associated with shallow quantum circuits. The results presented above demonstrate that QDAE is a potential quantum-aided architecture for denoising retinal images and a feasible preprocessing procedure in early diabetic retinopathy."

While traditional screening methods rely heavily on manual ophthalmologic evaluations, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have opened new avenues for automated, scalable, and interpretable diagnostic tools. However, challenges persist in developing models that are not only high-performing but also transparent enough to gain clinical trust.ObjectiveThis study introduces a novel, standardized, and interpretable ML framework designed specifically to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for DR risk prediction. By prioritizing model interpretability alongside predictive performance, our approach aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and clinical applicability.MethodsWe evaluated eleven ML algorithms, optimizing hyperparameters via grid search and five-fold cross-validation to identify top-performing models. A key innovation lies in our dynamic weighted voting ensemble (Voting_soft), which integrates multiple classifiers based on model confidence, thereby leveraging the strengths of diverse algorithms. Model performance was rigorously assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) metrics, with ROC and PR curves comparing performance across varying training dataset proportions. Crucially, we employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretability analysis, providing clinicians with actionable insights into feature contributions.ResultsThrough LightGBM-based correlation analysis and AUC curve determination, fourteen clinical features were identified as optimal predictors. Notably, the CatBoost model achieved superior performance on a 20% test set, while the Extreme Random Tree model demonstrated robustness on a 30% test set. Our dynamic weighted voting ensemble (Voting_soft) outperformed individual models in terms of AUC across both datasets. SHAP analysis revealed that age, triglycerides, sex, and HDL-C were key predictors of DR prevalence, offering clinically meaningful explanations for model decisions.ConclusionsThis study presents a groundbreaking ML-based DR risk prediction system that excels in both accuracy and interpretability. The integration of SHAP analysis not only enhances model transparency but also empowers clinicians with a deeper understanding of diagnostic decision-making, ultimately improving the precision and efficiency of DR screening. Our dynamic voting ensemble approach sets a new benchmark for interpretable, multi-model integration in medical diagnostics."

Traditional machine learning and deep learning-based approaches, while effective, often suffer from issues such as limited interpretability, static decision-making, and inadequate generalization across diverse patient data. This research introduces an Agentic-AI Driven Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis (AADR-AI), which leverages intelligent agent-based learning mechanisms to enhance decision-making autonomy, dynamic adaptability, and contextual understanding of retinal fundus images. The novelty lies in incorporating agentic intelligence principles, autonomy, reactivity, and proactivity into DR detection systems, allowing real-time analysis and adaptive feature learning based on patient-specific variations. The proposed AADR-AI framework integrates a multi-agent ensemble of convolutional and transformer-based networks, coordinated through a decision fusion layer for robust classification. Key contributions include improved classification accuracy (up to 96.7%), enhanced model efficiency with reduced computational overhead, and real-time adaptability to varying image qualities and disease progression stages.

Early detection of this disease plays a vital role in reducing its complications. However, machine learning and deep learning models often face distrust in medical settings due to their opaque, ""black-box"" nature. The aim of this study was to combine three machine learning algorithms using stacking and voting methods to propose a model for type 2 diabetes detection, and to increase transparency by using the explainability techniques LIME and SHAP to identify important features. This study used medical data from 768 Pima Indians Diabetes samples, including 8 features such as age, BMI, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, skin thickness, pregnancies, and family history. Data preprocessing included mean imputation for missing or zero values, Min-Max normalization, and classification into ""Normal"", ""Prediabetes"", and ""Diabetes"" based on fasting glucose thresholds. Feature selection was performed using Spearman correlation to retain the most relevant variables. A hybrid machine learning model was developed using three base models Neural Network (NN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) with automated hyperparameter tuning. The outputs of these models were combined via stacking using a logistic regression (LR) meta-model and in parallel using a soft voting method. Nested cross-validation (5 outer and 5 inner folds) was applied to prevent data leakage and ensure robust evaluation. Model interpretability was assessed using LIME for local explanations and SHAP for global feature importance. Decision thresholds and influential feature regions were identified, and model calibration and decision curves evaluated clinical reliability. Models performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUROC, Brier Score (1-B), and Expected Calibration Error (1-E). Statistical reliability was assessed using bootstrap resampling to compute 95% confidence intervals, as well as paired tests to compare the hybrid model with the base models and voting ensemble. Based on the evaluation metrics, the stacking ensemble achieved perfect performance for Class 0, with 100% accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and AUROC, alongside the highest calibration metrics (Brier Score: 99.9, ECE: 98.7). The Random Forest model also excelled, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score for Class 0 and Class 2. In contrast, the KNN model consistently underperformed, particularly for Class 0 (F1: 83.3, Precision: 83.3, Recall: 83.3). The Neural Network demonstrated strong recall for Class 0 (100%), while the voting ensemble showed balanced results but was slightly outperformed by the top ensemble methods. Explainable AI analyses using LIME and SHAP revealed that glucose was the most influential predictor for identifying the Pre-diabetes state. Both methods consistently identified a decision band between 0.35 and 0.47 (corresponding to 100-125 mg/dL) as the transition zone between ""Normal"" and ""Prediabetes"", confirming the model's alignment with WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria. The stacking model achieved perfect performance and superior calibration, outperforming all other models in type 2 diabetes prediction and classification. Explainability techniques (LIME and SHAP) identified glucose level, body mass index, and blood pressure as key predictive factors. This approach provides an accurate and interpretable tool for clinical decision support in healthcare systems."

- **Reasoning:** Uses machine learning to predict glucose from CGM, phone sensors, and user input, directly supporting diabetes management with real‑time alerts; limited discussion of interpretability or fairness.","This paper presents DiaBits, an iPhone application that allows patients with diabetes to efficiently monitor and manage their blood glucose levels in real time. Using current CGM data, smartphone sensor data, and user inputs, DiaBits takes advantage of modern machine learning techniques to predict future blood glucose fluctuations up to 60 minutes in advance. These predictions, which are over 95% clinically acceptable according to standard Error Grid Analysis methods, give the patients an opportunity to take corrective action in advance in order to keep their blood glucose values within normal range. Additionally, the presence of predictive alarms and statistical tools for analysis of past data makes it easier for the users to manage their condition and have better blood glucose control. The paper discusses some of the details of the predictive approach, provides accuracy results for 1.63 million predictions made for free-living users of the application, gives a detailed overview of the available features and the interface of DiaBits, and describes some challenges related to using machine learning for real-time predictions of blood glucose behavior.

- **Reasoning:** Uses multi-feature projection and graph Laplacian for ML‑based diabetes detection from pulse signals; directly applies the model to DM diagnosis; combines several pulse views, but lacks explicit clinical decision support, interpretability, or privacy‑focused components.","Computational pulse diagnosis is a convenient, non-invasive, and effective Diabetes Mellitus (DM) detection technique. Generally, diverse pulse features are extracted from different views to represent pulse signals and then used for achieving the pulse diagnosis. However, current pulse-based DM detection methods only used one pulse feature for detection, ignoring the fact that diverse pulse features can be combined together to boost the diagnosis performance. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-Feature Complementary Learning (MFCL) model for DM detection. By designing feature-specific projections, multiple features are separately projected into a shared observation space and effectively fused into one vector. Besides, a mapping function is built to correlate the fused vectors to category labels to make the fused vectors suitable for classification. Inspired by the graph Laplacian matrix, which effectively preserves the correlations among samples from different categories, we integrate it in MFCL and design a discriminative prior to make the fused vectors sufficiently discriminative. Finally, an optimization algorithm is proposed to alternatively optimize the projection variables and then generate fused feature vectors. The proposed method reaches an accuracy of 92.85% in DM detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

One of the few effective approaches is to actively manage diabetes via a healthy and active lifestyle. Objectives This research is focused on early detection of prediabetes and T2DM using wearable technology and Internet-of-Things-based monitoring applications. Methods We developed an artificial intelligence model based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference to detect prediabetes and T2DM via individualized monitoring. The key contributing factors to the proposed model include heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing rate, breathing volume, and activity data (steps, cadence, and calories). The data was collected using an advanced wearable body vest and combined with manual recordings of blood glucose, height, weight, age, and sex. The model analyzed the data alongside a clinical knowledgebase. Fuzzy rules were used to establish baseline values via existing interventions, clinical guidelines, and protocols. Results The proposed model was tested and validated using Kappa analysis and achieved an overall agreement of 91%. Conclusion We also present a 2-year follow-up observation from the prediction results of the original model. Moreover, the diabetic profile of a participant using M-health applications and a wearable vest (smart shirt) improved when compared to the traditional/routine practice."

Using blood glucose data from type 2 diabetes patients, we propose a deep learning model-based framework to forecast blood glucose levels. We used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected from inpatients with type 2 diabetes for a week. We adopted the Transformer model, commonly used in sequence data, to forecast the blood glucose level over time and detect hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in advance. We expected the attention mechanism in Transformer to reveal a hint of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and performed a comparative study to determine whether Transformer was effective in the classification and regression of glucose. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia rarely occur and this results in an imbalance in the classification. We built a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network. Our contributions are as follows. First, we developed a deep learning framework utilizing the encoder part of Transformer to perform the regression and classification under a unified framework. Second, we adopted a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network suitable for time-series data to solve the data imbalance problem and to improve performance. Third, we collected data for type 2 diabetic inpatients for mid-time. Finally, we incorporated transfer learning to improve the performance of regression and classification. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses DenseNet-169 to detect diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, directly applying deep learning to a diabetes‑related imaging task; lacks interpretability, bias analysis, or federated approaches.","Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that targets the eyes by damaging the retinal blood vessels. Initially it is asymptomatic or causes fluctuating vision problems. As it becomes severe, it affects both the eyes and eventually causes partial or complete vision loss. Primarily occurs when the blood sugar level is unmanageable. Therefore, the person with diabetes mellitus is always at a high risk of acquiring this disease. The early detection can deter the contingency of complete and permanent blindness. Thus, requires an efficient screening system. The present work considers a deep learning methodology specifically a Densely Connected Convolutional Network DenseNet-169, which is applied for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy. It classifies the fundus images based on its severity levels as No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe and Proliferative DR. The datasets that are taken into consideration are Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 2015 and Aptos 2019 Blindness Detection which are both obtained from Kaggle. The proposed method is accomplished through various steps: Data Collection, Preprocessing, Augmentation and modelling. Our proposed model achieved 90% of accuracy. The Regression model was also employed, manifested up an accuracy of 78%. The main aim of this work is to develop a robust system for detecting DR automatically."

There is an increasing demand for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and trends detection amongst people with diabetes and healthy individuals, especially athletes. Wearable devices and non-invasive sensors for blood glucose monitoring have witnessed considerable advances. This review is an update on recent contributions utilizing novel sensing technologies over the past five years which include electrocardiogram, electromagnetic, bioimpedance, photoplethysmography, and acceleration measures as well as bodily fluid glucose sensors to monitor glucose and trend detection. We also review methods that use machine learning algorithms to predict blood glucose trends, especially for high risk events such as hypoglycemia. Convolutional and recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees are examples of such machine learning algorithms.

Provides decision‑support insight but lacks interpretability, bias analysis, or federated approaches; incorporates demographic and health metrics as multiple data inputs.","Background: Clinical guidelines do not specify the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for the ∼85% of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not on intensive insulin therapy. For these individuals, insurance covers a limited amount of testing supplies, and blood glucose (BG) checks are infrequent. With limited BG data, people may not know how foods, activity, and other factors affect their BG levels. Other, non-SMBG-dependent, approaches are needed to illustrate how self-care choices affect BG. Objectives: 1.) Use a large dataset to train a machine learning model 2.) Use the model and minimal data inputs to predict BG values at variable times 3.) Test the accuracy of the prediction. Methods: The One Drop | Mobile app collected 1,923,416 BG measurements from 14,706 people with noninsulin treated T2D. Contextual information (CI), when available, included demographics, health metrics (e.g., weight, A1c), and self-care. Inputs to each BG prediction included a prior BG and available CI. The model did not distinguish whether BGs with similar CI were from the same or different users. Forecast horizons were set by the time since prior BG and varied from 10 minutes to several days. Machine learning algorithms to predict BG values were trained and vetted on BGs entered prior to Sept. 2017 (83% of all BGs). BGs (17%) entered from Sept.-Nov. 2017 were held out and predicted. Results: Users were 59% male, with 80% from North America, 9% from Europe, and 11% from elsewhere; 50% were diagnosed with T2D in the past 3 years. The median and mean absolute error of holdout predictions were 14.2 and 21.3 mg/dL respectively, with 91% of predictions within +/-50 mg/dL. Discussion: A machine learning model with minimal inputs accurately predicts future BG values in noninsulin treated people with T2D. Whether people modify their behavior (e.g., eating less carbohydrates) after knowing a planned behavior (e.g., a 60 carbohydrate gram meal) produces an undesirable BG (>140 mg/dL postprandial) is an empirical question worth investigating.

Advanced time blood glucose level prediction enables diabetic patients to better manage their blood glucose levels and receive early warnings about the wrong treatments and adverse conditions such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. In this study, an artificial neural network is trained for 30- and 60-min prediction horizon by using physiological models for insulin injection, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity in addition to past CGM data for each of six real T1D patients. The mean of the prediction error for six patients is obtained as 18.81 mg/dL and 30.89 mg/dL for 30- and 60-min prediction horizons, respectively. These results are better than the other studies in the literature that use real patient data, and the model is computationally simpler compared to the deep learning-based methods. Therefore, in this study, a model that can be implemented on the mobile or embedded device, learn the patient’s physiologic dynamics, and make accurate predictions during the measurements is developed and presented."

- **Reasoning:** Adapts DINOv2 for retinal fundus images, targeting diabetic retinopathy; introduces block expansion for domain adaptation and mitigates forgetting, but lacks explicit decision‑support or bias analysis.","Integrating deep learning into medical imaging is poised to greatly advance diagnostic methods but it faces challenges with generalizability. Foundation models, based on self-supervised learning, address these issues and improve data efficiency. Natural domain foundation models show promise for medical imaging, but systematic research evaluating domain adaptation, especially using self-supervised learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, remains underexplored. Additionally, little research addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning of foundation models. We adapted the DINOv2 vision transformer for retinal imaging classification tasks using self-supervised learning and generated two novel foundation models termed DINORET and BE DINORET. Publicly available color fundus photographs were employed for model development and subsequent fine-tuning for diabetic retinopathy staging and glaucoma detection. We introduced block expansion as a novel domain adaptation strategy and assessed the models for catastrophic forgetting. Models were benchmarked to RETFound, a state-of-the-art foundation model in ophthalmology. DINORET and BE DINORET demonstrated competitive performance on retinal imaging tasks, with the block expanded model achieving the highest scores on most datasets. Block expansion successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting. Our few-shot learning studies indicated that DINORET and BE DINORET outperform RETFound in terms of data-efficiency. This study highlights the potential of adapting natural domain vision models to retinal imaging using self-supervised learning and block expansion. BE DINORET offers robust performance without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. Our findings suggest that these methods could enable healthcare institutions to develop tailored vision models for their patient populations, enhancing global healthcare inclusivity. "

This study aimed to develop age-specific DM prediction models using machine learning (ML) and anomaly detection algorithms.

Four models were constructed, comprising a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), TabNet, Variational Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest (IF), to predict DM onset within three years. The models were trained using the Kanazawa dataset and externally validated using the Hakui dataset. Performance was evaluated based on the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. The LGBM model demonstrated the highest AUC across multiple age groups in both internal and external validations. For participants in their 50s and 60s, the LGBM achieved AUC values of 0.911 during internal validation, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding those of the other models. In contrast, the IF model exhibited the best performance for participants in their 40s. The findings of this study suggest the potential effectiveness of age-specific models in improving diabetes prediction accuracy within the study population. Further validation using more diverse populations and younger age groups are recommended for future research. "

Reviews model quality and evaluation metrics, but lacks deep decision‑support, interpretability, or privacy‑preserving methods.","Background In 2021 alone, diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder primarily characterized by abnormally high blood glucose (BG) levels, affected 537 million people globally, and over 6 million deaths were reported. The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.

- **Reasoning:** Uses ML models to estimate blood glucose from multiple wearable sensor streams, directly applying AI to diabetes management; provides accuracy metrics but lacks interpretability, privacy, or bias analysis.","Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is characterized by impaired ability to metabolize glucose for use in cells for energy, resulting in high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). DM impacted 463 million individuals worldwide in 2019, with over four million fatalities documented. Blood glucose levels (BGL) are usually measured, as standard protocols, through invasive procedures. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques have demonstrated the potential to estimate BGL using data collected by non-invasive Wearable Devices (WDs), thereby, facilitating monitoring and management of diabetics. One of the key aspects of WDs with machine learning (ML) algorithms is to find specific data signatures, called Digital biomarkers, that can be used in classification or gaging the extent of the underlying condition. The use of such biomarkers to monitor glycemic events represents a major shift in technology for self-monitoring and developing digital biomarkers using non-invasive WDs. To do this, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between characteristics acquired from non-invasive WDs and indicators of glycemic health; furthermore, much work is needed to validate accuracy. The study aimed to investigate performance of AI models in estimating BGL among diabetic patients using non-invasive wearable devices data An open-source dataset was used which provided BGL readings, diabetic status (Diabetic or non-diabetic), heart rate, Blood oxygen level (SPO2), Diastolic Blood pressure, Systolic Blood Pressure, Body temperature, Sweating, and Shivering for 13 participants by age group taken from WDs. Our experimental design included Data Collection, Feature Engineering, ML model selection/development, and reporting evaluation of metrics. We were able to estimate with high accuracy (RMSE range: 0.099 to 0.197) the relationship between glycemic metrics and features that can be derived from non-invasive WDs when utilizing AI models. We provide further evidence of the feasibility of using commercially available WDs for the purpose of BGL estimation amongst diabetics. "

The ability to predict future glucose values can further optimize such devices. In this study, we used machine learning to train models in predicting future glucose levels based on prior CGM and accelerometry data. Methods We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observational population‐based cohort that comprises individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We included individuals who underwent >48h of CGM (n = 851), most of whom (n = 540) simultaneously wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity. A random subset of individuals was used to train models in predicting glucose levels at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on either CGM data or both CGM and accelerometer data. In the remaining individuals, model performance was evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE), Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rho) and surveillance error grid. For a proof-of-concept translation, CGM-based prediction models were optimized and validated with the use of data from individuals with type 1 diabetes (OhioT1DM Dataset, n = 6). Results Models trained with CGM data were able to accurately predict glucose values at 15 (RMSE: 0.19mmol/L; rho: 0.96) and 60 minutes (RMSE: 0.59mmol/L, rho: 0.72). Model performance was comparable in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Incorporation of accelerometer data only slightly improved prediction. The error grid results indicated that model predictions were clinically safe (15 min: >99%, 60 min >98%). Our prediction models translated well to individuals with type 1 diabetes, which is reflected by high accuracy (RMSEs for 15 and 60 minutes of 0.43 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively) and clinical safety (15 min: >99%, 60 min: >91%). Conclusions Machine learning-based models are able to accurately and safely predict glucose values at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on CGM data only. Future research should further optimize the models for implementation in closed-loop insulin delivery systems."

Although these approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as glucose prediction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), challenges remain in the acquisition of large-scale individual data for personalized modeling due to the elevated cost of clinical trials and data privacy regulations. In this work, we introduce GluGAN, a framework specifically designed for generating personalized glucose time series based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Employing recurrent neural network (RNN) modules, the proposed framework uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised training to learn temporal dynamics in latent spaces. Aiming to assess the quality of synthetic data, we apply clinical metrics, distance scores, and discriminative and predictive scores computed by post-hoc RNNs in evaluation. Across three clinical datasets with 47 T1D subjects (including one publicly available and two proprietary datasets), GluGAN achieved better performance for all the considered metrics when compared with four baseline GAN models. The performance of data augmentation is evaluated by three machine learning-based glucose predictors. Using the training sets augmented by GluGAN significantly reduced the root mean square error for the predictors over 30 and 60-minute horizons. The results suggest that GluGAN is an effective method in generating high-quality synthetic glucose time series and has the potential to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of automated insulin delivery algorithms and as a digital twin to substitute for pre-clinical trials."

Provides accurate forecasts but lacks explicit interpretability, privacy, or multimodal/federated components.","The chronic metabolic condition, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), is marked by consistent hyperglycemia due to the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin. This necessitates the patient's daily monitoring of blood glucose fluctuations to discern a trend and predict future glycemia, subsequently dictating the amount of external insulin needed to regulate glycemia effectively. However, this technique often grapples with a degree of inaccuracy, presenting potential hazards. Nonetheless, contemporary advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) coupled with novel biological signal sensors offer a refreshing perspective for DM1 management by enabling comprehensive, continual patient health evaluation. Herein, burgeoning technological disruptions such as Big Data, the internet of medical things (IoMT), cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms (ML) could serve pivotal roles in the effective control of DM1. This paper delves into the exploration of the latest IoMT-based methodologies for the unbroken surveillance of DM1 management, facilitating a profound characterization of diabetic patients. The fusion of wearable technologies with machine learning strategies has the potential to yield robust models for short-term blood glucose prediction. The ambition of this study is to develop precise, individual-centric prediction models harnessing an array of pertinent factors. The study applied modeling techniques to a comprehensive dataset comprising glycaemia-associated biological attributes, sourced from an expansive passive monitoring campaign involving 40 DM1 patients. Leveraging the Random Forest method, the resulting models can predict glucose levels over a 30-min time span with an average error as minimal as 18.60 mg/dL for six-hour data and 26.21 mg/dL for a 45-minute prediction horizon, offering also a good performance in the prediction delay.

- **Reasoning:** Uses time-series clustering to detect daily diabetes patterns, directly supporting insulin dosing decisions; offers personalized schedule advice but lacks deeper explainability or privacy‑focused innovations.","In type 1 diabetes, diurnal activity routines are influential factors in insulin dose calculations. Bolus advisors have been developed to more accurately suggest doses of meal-related insulin based on carbohydrate intake, according to pre-set insulin to carbohydrate levels and insulin sensitivity factors. These parameters can be varied according to the time of day and their optimal setting relies on identifying the daily time periods of routines accurately. The main issues with reporting and adjustments of daily activity routines are the reliance on self-reporting which is prone to inaccuracy and within bolus calculators, the keeping of default settings for daily time periods, such as within insulin pumps, glucose meters, and mobile applications. Moreover, daily routines are subject to change over periods of time which could go unnoticed. Hence, forgetting to change the daily time periods in the bolus calculator could contribute to sub-optimal self-management. In this paper, these issues are addressed by proposing a data-driven model for identification of diabetes diurnal patterns based on self-monitoring data. The model uses time-series clustering to achieve a meaningful separation of the patterns which is then used to identify the daily time periods and to advise of any time changes required. Further improvements in bolus advisor settings are proposed to include week/weekend or even modifiable daily time settings. The proposed model provides a quick, granular, more accurate, and personalized daily time setting profile while providing a more contextual perspective to glycemic pattern identification to both patients and clinicians."

Insulin helps glucose in your blood enter your muscle, fat, and liver cells so they can use it for energy or store it for later use. If insulin is insufficient, it causes sugar to build up in the blood and leads to serious health problems. People with Type 1 Diabetes need synthetic insulin every day. In diabetes management, continuous glucose monitoring is an important feature that provides near real-time blood glucose data. It is useful in deciding the synthetic insulin dose. In this research work, we used machine learning tools, deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and voting and stacking regressors to predict blood glucose levels at 30-min time intervals using the latest DiaTrend dataset. Predicting blood glucose levels is useful in better diabetes management systems. The trained models were compared using several evaluation metrics.

The recent increase in wearable devices for diabetes care, and in particular the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), generates large datasets and associated cybersecurity challenges. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify CGM data at an individual level by using standard machine learning techniques.


METHODS
The publicly available REPLACE-BG dataset containing 226 adult participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) wearing CGM over 6 months was used. A support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier aiming to determine if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual participant was trained and tested for each of the subjects in the dataset. To generate the feature vector used for classification, 12 standard glycaemic metrics were selected and evaluated at different time periods of the day (24h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, dinner). Different window lengths of CGM data (3, 7, 15, and 30 days) were chosen to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. A recursive feature selection method was employed to select the minimum subset of features that did not significantly degrade performance.


RESULTS
A total of 40 features were generated as a result of evaluating the glycemic metrics over the selected time periods (24h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, dinner). A window length of 15 days was found to perform the best in terms of accuracy (86.8±12.8%) and F1 score (0.86±0.16). The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 85.7±19.5% and 87.9±17.5%, respectively. Through recursive feature selection, a subset of 11 features was shown to perform similarly to the 40 features.


CONCLUSION
It is possible to determine with a relatively high accuracy if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual. The proposed approach can be used as a digital CGM 'fingerprint' or for detecting glycaemic changes within an individual, for example during intercurrent illness."

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers an opportunity for patients with diabetes to modify their lifestyle to better manage their condition and for clinicians to provide personalized healthcare and lifestyle advice. However, analytic tools are needed to standardize and analyze the rich data that emerge from CGM devices. This would allow glucotypes of patients to be identified to aid clinical decision-making. Methods. In this paper, we develop an analysis pipeline for CGM data and apply it to 148 diabetic patients with a total of 8632 days of follow up. The pipeline projects CGM data to a lower-dimensional space of features representing centrality, spread, size, and duration of glycemic excursions and the circadian cycle. We then use principal components analysis and k-means to cluster patients’ records into one of four glucotypes and analyze cluster membership using multinomial logistic regression. Results. Glucotypes differ in the degree of control, amount of time spent in range, and on the presence and timing of hyper- and hypoglycemia. Patients on the program had statistically significant improvements in their glucose levels. Conclusions. This pipeline provides a fast automatic function to label raw CGM data without manual input."

Reviews methods but lacks clinical decision, interpretability, or fairness analysis.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a dangerous eye condition that affects diabetic patients. Without early detection, it can affect the retina and may eventually cause permanent blindness. The early diagnosis of DR is crucial for its treatment. However, the diagnosis of DR is a very difficult process that requires an experienced ophthalmologist. A breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence called deep learning can help in giving the ophthalmologist a second opinion regarding the classification of the DR by using an autonomous classifier. To accurately train a deep learning model to classify DR, an enormous number of images is required, and this is an important limitation in the DR domain. Transfer learning is a technique that can help in overcoming the scarcity of images. The main idea that is exploited by transfer learning is that a deep learning architecture, previously trained on non-medical images, can be fine-tuned to suit the DR dataset. This paper reviews research papers that focus on DR classification by using transfer learning to present the best existing methods to address this problem. This review can help future researchers to find out existing transfer learning methods to address the DR classification task and to show their differences in terms of performance."

The number of diabetic patients will increase to 552 million by 2034, as per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Aim With advances in computer science techniques, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), opportunities for the detection of DR at the early stages have increased. This increase means that the chances of recovery will increase and the possibility of vision loss in patients will be reduced in the future. Methods In this paper, deep transfer learning models for medical DR detection were investigated. The DL models were trained and tested over the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 dataset. According to literature surveys, this research is considered one the first studies to use of the APTOS 2019 dataset, as it was freshly published in the second quarter of 2019. The selected deep transfer models in this research were AlexNet, Res-Net18, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, and VGG19. These models were selected, as they consist of a small number of layers when compared to larger models, such as DenseNet and InceptionResNet. Data augmentation techniques were used to render the models more robust and to overcome the overfitting problem. Results The testing accuracy and performance metrics, such as the precision, recall, and F1 score, were calculated to prove the robustness of the selected models. The AlexNet model achieved the highest testing accuracy at 97.9%. In addition, the achieved performance metrics strengthened our achieved results. Moreover, AlexNet has a minimum number of layers, which decreases the training time and the computational complexity."

- **Reasoning:** Uses regression and classification ML to predict hypo/hyperglycemic events from CGM data, directly addressing diabetes management. Focuses on prediction performance rather than interpretability or privacy, and does not involve multimodal, federated, imaging, bias, or transfer learning aspects.","The most important objective of any diabetes therapy is to maintain the blood glucose concentration within the euglycemic range, avoiding or at least mitigating critical hypo/hyperglycemic episodes. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices bear the promise of providing the patients with an increased and timely awareness of glycemic conditions as these get dangerously near to hypo/hyperglycemia. The challenge is to detect, with reasonable advance, the patterns leading to risky situations, allowing the patient to make therapeutic decisions on the basis of future (predicted) glucose concentration levels. We underline that a technically sound performance comparison of the approaches proposed in recent years has yet to be done, thus it is unclear which one is preferred. The aim of this study is to fill this gap by carrying out a comparative analysis among the most common methods for glucose event prediction. Both regression and classification algorithms have been implemented and analyzed, including static and dynamic training approaches. The dataset consists of 89 CGM time series measured in diabetic subjects for 7 subsequent days. Performance metrics, specifically defined to assess and compare the event-prediction capabilities of the methods, have been introduced and analyzed. Our numerical results show that a static training approach exhibits better performance, in particular when regression methods are considered. However, classifiers show some improvement when trained for a specific event category, such as hyperglycemia, achieving performance comparable to the regressors, with the advantage of predicting the events sooner."

- **Reasoning:** Systematic review of ML/DL hypoglycemia prediction models for T1D, directly linking AI methods to diabetes care; includes performance metrics but lacks detailed trustworthiness or multimodal/federated aspects.","Background Diabetes is a chronic condition that necessitates regular monitoring and self-management of the patient’s blood glucose levels. People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can live a productive life if they receive proper diabetes care. Nonetheless, a loose glycemic control might increase the risk of developing hypoglycemia. This incident can occur because of a variety of causes, such as taking additional doses of insulin, skipping meals, or overexercising. Mainly, the symptoms of hypoglycemia range from mild dysphoria to more severe conditions, if not detected in a timely manner. Objective In this review, we aimed to report on innovative detection techniques and tactics for identifying and preventing hypoglycemic episodes, focusing on T1D. Methods A systematic literature search following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was performed focusing on the PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library to find articles on technologies related to hypoglycemia detection in patients with T1D. Results The presented approaches have been used or devised to enhance blood glucose monitoring and boost its efficacy in forecasting future glucose levels, which could aid the prediction of future episodes of hypoglycemia. We detected 19 predictive models for hypoglycemia, specifically on T1D, using a wide range of algorithmic methodologies, spanning from statistics (1.9/19, 10%) to machine learning (9.88/19, 52%) and deep learning (7.22/19, 38%). The algorithms used most were the Kalman filtering and classification models (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests). The performance of the predictive models was found to be satisfactory overall, reaching accuracies between 70% and 99%, which proves that such technologies are capable of facilitating the prediction of T1D hypoglycemia. Conclusions It is evident that continuous glucose monitoring can improve glucose control in diabetes; however, predictive models for hypo- and hyperglycemia using only mainstream noninvasive sensors such as wristbands and smartwatches are foreseen to be the next step for mobile health in T1D. Prospective studies are required to demonstrate the value of such models in real-life mobile health interventions."

Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes reduce the risk and slow the progression of debilitating complications, such as amputation, vision loss, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, dementia, some cancers, and infections like tuberculosis and severe COVID-19. Current screening methods for diabetes are invasive and costly. This has limited their utilization, especially in high-density populations and low- and middle-income countries such as Indonesia.

Early detection and prevention of DR is crucial to reduce the burden of this disease. The purpose of this study was to build a prediction model for DR using pupillary abnormalities as biomarkers. Pupillary parameters including Dark-adapted Baseline Pupillary Diameter (BPD), Amplitude of Pupillary Constriction (APC), Velocity of Pupillary Constriction (VPC), Amplitude of Pupil Re-dilatation after Maximum Constriction, and Velocity of Pupillary Dilatation (VPD) were collected and analyzed using machine learning algorithm including Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regressions, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier. Utilizing ROC analysis and the Youden index, this study identified cut-off values for pupillary abnormalities to detect DR risk. The study found that ANN performed well with an accuracy of 0.807 (95% CI: 0.65-0.94) and AUC of 0.879 (95% CI: 0.71-0.98) in predicting DR using pupillary abnormalities as biomarkers. The findings of this research offer significant insights into the predictive value of pupillary abnormalities for DR, establishing a strong foundation for early intervention strategies. Particularly, the superior performance of ANN in detecting DR presents an opportunity to refine risk stratification and prevention approaches, potentially transforming the prognosis for individuals at elevated risk of this condition."

Insulin helps glucose in your blood enter your muscle, fat, and liver cells so they can use it for energy or store it for later use. If insulin is insufficient, it causes sugar to build up in the blood and leads to serious health problems. People with Type 1 Diabetes need synthetic insulin every day. In diabetes management, continuous glucose monitoring is an important feature that provides near real-time blood glucose data. It is useful in deciding the synthetic insulin dose. In this research work, we used machine learning tools, deep neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, and voting and stacking regressors to predict blood glucose levels at 30-min time intervals using the latest DiaTrend dataset. Predicting blood glucose levels is useful in better diabetes management systems. The trained models were compared using several evaluation metrics.

This study explores the potential of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to analyze body composition measurements as predictors for diabetes screening. We begin by carefully preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and classifying features to prepare the data for modeling. To enhance the dataset and improve model generalization, we implemented Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) for data augmentation. The dataset is then split using stratified five-fold cross-validation to ensure balanced and reliable evaluation. We evaluate ten different ML models simultaneously, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, LightGBM, TabNet, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The proposed approach, which integrates CTGAN-based augmentation with these diverse models, achieves strong predictive results. Among the models tested, MLP stands out with the best performance, reaching an accuracy of 93.91%. Other metrics also confirm its strength: AUROC at 93.87%, precision at 94.48%, recall at 93.87%, F1 score at 93.89%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient at 88.34%, and geometric mean at 93.71%. These results demonstrate that our combined methodology effectively captures complex relationships within body composition data and offers a reliable tool to support clinical decision-making in diabetes risk assessment. Future work may integrate additional clinical parameters to further enhance prediction accuracy and applicability in real-world settings. "

- **Reasoning:** Survey reviews deep‑learning CAD for diabetic retinopathy using fundus images, proposes multi‑trait fusion, but lacks original models, bias analysis, or federated learning.","The incidence of diabetic retinopathy globally calls for advanced and more universally applicable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. This survey paper explores the current state of vision-based CAD techniques for the detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy, a diabetes-induced eye disorder that can lead to severe visual impairment or blindness. Characterized by a variety of manifestations including microaneurysms, exudates, hemorrhages, and macular detachment, diabetic retinopathy presents substantial challenges for automated detection. This is primarily due to the heterogeneity of retinal fundus images, which display diverse spatiotextural features and intricate vascular structures. Our exhaustive review indicates that most existing methodologies predominantly concentrate on isolated diabetic retinopathy types, employing localized spatiotextural feature analysis for classification. Such specificity often results in limited accuracy and generalizability, restricting practical real-world application. Furthermore, contemporary leading methods generally focus on single retinal characteristics, necessitating patients to undergo multiple CAD procedures, thereby increasing time, costs, and possibly intensifying retinal complexities. To overcome these obstacles, we propose the adoption of multi-trait-driven CAD solutions. Utilizing the potent capabilities of deep learning, these solutions could employ high-dimensional, multi-cue sensitive feature extraction and ensemble learning for classification. This approach is designed to improve the generalizability and dependability of CAD systems, offering a holistic solution capable of effectively managing the diverse manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. Our study highlights the need for a fundamental transformation in diabetic retinopathy CAD systems, motivating further research towards robust, multi-modal methods to enhance detection, classification, and grading of this widespread ailment.

DR is the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults around the world and estimated it may affect more than 93 million people. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or controlled if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process, which requires an ophthalmologist or trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina, to identify DR by the presence of lesions associated with the vascular abnormalities caused by the disease.The automated method of DR screening will speed up the detection and decision-making process, which will help to control or manage DR progression. This paper presents an automated classification system, in which it analyzes fundus images with varying illumination and fields of view and generates a severity grade for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using machine learning models such as CNN, VGG-16 and VGG-19.This system achieves 80% sensitivity, 82% accuracy, 82% specificity, and 0.904 AUC for classifying images into 5 categories ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 is no DR and 4 is proliferative DR."

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of AI-DSS in real world diabetes clinics.
 Methods: Data was collected and evaluated from routine AI-DSS usage for individuals with type 1 diabetes treated at 21 diabetes clinics (in the USA and 2 in Israel) . Two analyses were made: (1) Insulin dose recommendations were compared for rate of agreement/disagreement between those suggested by the AI-DSS and the approved recommendations by health care providers (HCP) . (2) Glycemic outcomes were compared between baseline and after 3 months of AI-DSS use. Included in this analysis were individuals who had mean baseline glucose level ≥ 182 mg/dL and at least one AI-DSS recommendation within the 3-months.
 Results: A total of 8 recommendations, provided to 370 individuals, were evaluated. Full agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments was observed in 87%, 87%, and 83% of the basal rate, carbs ratio (CR) , and correction factor (CF) pump settings parameters, respectively. Full disagreement on the direction of dose change was observed in only 0.9%, 0.5%, and 1.2% for the basal rate, CR and CF, respectively. Glycemic outcome analysis included 1 eligible individuals (mean of 1.6 recommendations within a 3-month interval) . Average sensor percentage of time in range [70-180 mg/dL] increased by 4% (p=0.003) : 43% increased time in range by more than 5% and 33% increased by 10% or more. Time in hyperglycemia [> 180 mg/dL] was reduced by 5% (p<0.01) while time in severe hypoglycemia [< 54 mg/dL] remained below 0.5%.
 Conclusion: A high rate of agreement with automated insulin adjustments was observed among HCPs at academic centers who used the AI-DSS in their workflow. Glycemic control was significantly improved for sub-optimally controlled individuals already after 3-months of follow up.

The different approaches take a much longer time for a very large training dataset. In classifying to better the accuracy of diabetic retinopathy, a novel technique called MAP Concordance Regressive Camargo’s Index-Based Deep Multilayer Perceptive Learning Classification (MAPCRCI-DMPLC) has been introduced with minimum time consumption. The novel model of MAPCRCI-DMPLC comprises the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer for detecting diabetic retinopathy at an early stage through high accuracy and less moment consumption. The proposed MAPCRCI-DMPLC model collected the retinal fundus images from the dataset as input. After that, we carried out image preprocessing using the MAP-estimated local region filtering-based preprocessing technique in the first hidden layer. In the second hidden layer, Camargo’s index-based ROI extraction is performed to identify the infected region. Then, Concordance Correlative Regression is applied for texture feature extraction. Then the color feature is extracted, beginning the image. The features extracted to the output layer to classify the different levels of DR using the swish activation function through higher accuracy. An investigational assessment using a retinal image dataset on factors such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), disease detection accuracy (DDA), false-positive rate (FPR), and disease detection time (DDT), regarding the quantity of retinal fundus images and image dimension. The quantitative and qualitatively analyzed outcome shows a better presentation of our proposed MAPCRCI-DMPLC technique when compared through the five state-of-the-art approaches. "

In this paper, we present a robust novel paradigm based on analyzing photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. The method includes signal pre-processing optimization and a multi-view cross-fusion transformer (MvCFT) network for non-invasive BG assessment. Specifically, a multi-size weighted fitting (MSWF) time-domain filtering algorithm is proposed to optimally preserve the most authentic morphological features of the original signals. Meanwhile, the spatial position encoding-based kinetics features are reconstructed and embedded as prior knowledge to discern the implicit physiological patterns. In addition, a cross-view feature fusion (CVFF) module is designed to incorporate pairwise mutual information among different views to adequately capture the potential complementary features in physiological sequences. Finally, the subject- wise 5- fold cross-validation is performed on a clinical dataset of 260 subjects. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of BG measurements are 1.129 mmol/L and 0.659 mmol/L, respectively, and the optimal Zone A in the Clark error grid, representing none clinical risk, is 87.89%.

The latest continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology allows people to observe glucose in real-time. However, an accurate glucose forecast remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce GluNet, a framework that leverages on a personalized deep neural network to predict the probabilistic distribution of short-term (30–60 minutes) future CGM measurements for subjects with T1D based on their historical data including glucose measurements, meal information, insulin doses, and other factors. It adopts the latest deep learning techniques consisting of four components: data pre-processing, label transform/recover, multi-layers of dilated convolution neural network (CNN), and post-processing. The method is evaluated in-silico for both adult and adolescent subjects. The results show significant improvements over existing methods in the literature through a comprehensive comparison in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) ( $\text{8.88} \pm \text{0.77}$ mg/dL) with short time lag ( $\text{0.83}\pm \text{0.40}$ minutes) for prediction horizons (PH) = 30 mins (minutes), and RMSE ( $\text{19.90} \pm \text{3.17}$ mg/dL) with time lag ( $\text{16.43}\pm \text{4.07}$ mins) for PH = 60 mins for virtual adult subjects.

Results show that it achieves an RMSE ( $\text{19.28} \pm \text{2.76}$  mg/dL) with time lag ( $\text{8.03}\pm \text{4.07}$ mins) for PH = 30 mins and an RMSE ( $\text{31.83} \pm \text{3.49}$ mg/dL) with time lag ( $\text{17.78}\pm \text{8.00}$  mins) for PH = 60 mins.

DR is a primary cause of blindness in working-age people and it is estimated that 3 to 4 million people with diabetes are blinded by DR every year worldwide. Early diagnosis have been considered an effective way to mitigate such problem. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to analyze the DR images generated by the fundus camera for automatically DR diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on identifying small lesions on DR fundus images. The results from our analysis, which include the lesion category and their exact locations in the image, can be used to facilitate the determination of DR severity (indicated by DR stages). Different from traditional object detection for natural images, lesion detection for fundus images have unique challenges. Specifically, the size of a lesion instance is usually very small, compared with the original resolution of the fundus images, making them diffcult to be detected. We analyze the lesion-vs-image scale carefully and propose a large-size feature pyramid network (LFPN) to preserve more image details for mini lesion instance detection. Our method includes an effective region proposal strategy to increase the sensitivity. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to the original feature pyramid network (FPN) method and Faster RCNN."

- **Reasoning:** Uses a novel multi-feature learning model to classify pulse signals for diabetes detection, achieving high accuracy. No focus on interpretability, privacy, or deployment; only modest multimodal aspect via multiple pulse features.","Computational pulse diagnosis is a convenient, non-invasive, and effective Diabetes Mellitus (DM) detection technique. Generally, diverse pulse features are extracted from different views to represent pulse signals and then used for achieving the pulse diagnosis. However, current pulse-based DM detection methods only used one pulse feature for detection, ignoring the fact that diverse pulse features can be combined together to boost the diagnosis performance. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-Feature Complementary Learning (MFCL) model for DM detection. By designing feature-specific projections, multiple features are separately projected into a shared observation space and effectively fused into one vector. Besides, a mapping function is built to correlate the fused vectors to category labels to make the fused vectors suitable for classification. Inspired by the graph Laplacian matrix, which effectively preserves the correlations among samples from different categories, we integrate it in MFCL and design a discriminative prior to make the fused vectors sufficiently discriminative. Finally, an optimization algorithm is proposed to alternatively optimize the projection variables and then generate fused feature vectors. The proposed method reaches an accuracy of 92.85% in DM detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. "

Discusses decision support and affordability but lacks new models, multimodal data, federated learning, imaging, or bias analysis.","Proper insulin management is vital for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and preventing complications associated with diabetes. However, the soaring costs of insulin present significant challenges to ensuring affordable management. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of current literature on the application of machine learning (ML) in insulin management for diabetes patients, particularly focusing on enhancing affordability and accessibility within the United States. The review encompasses various facets of insulin management, including dosage calculation and response, prediction of blood glucose and insulin sensitivity, initial insulin estimation, resistance prediction, treatment adherence, complications, hypoglycemia prediction, and lifestyle modifications. Additionally, the study identifies key limitations in the utilization of ML within the insulin management literature and suggests future research directions aimed at furthering accessible and affordable insulin treatments. These proposed directions include exploring insurance coverage, optimizing insulin type selection, assessing the impact of biosimilar insulin and market competition, considering mental health factors, evaluating insulin delivery options, addressing cost-related issues affecting insulin usage and adherence, and selecting appropriate patient cost-sharing programs. By examining the potential of ML in addressing insulin management affordability and accessibility, this work aims to envision improved and cost-effective insulin management practices. It not only highlights existing research gaps but also offers insights into future directions, guiding the development of innovative solutions that have the potential to revolutionize insulin management and benefit patients reliant on this life-saving treatment.

Effective management of diabetes, particularly monitoring and prediction of blood glucose levels, remains a significant challenge due to the severe health risks associated with inaccuracies, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. This study addresses this critical issue by employing a hybrid Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model designed to enhance the accuracy of future glucose level predictions based on data from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems. This innovative approach aims to reduce the risk of diabetic complications and improve patient outcomes. We utilized a dataset which contain more than 32000 data points comprising CGM data from eight patients collected by Suzhou Municipal Hospital in Jiangsu Province, China. This dataset includes historical glucose readings and equipment calibration values, making it highly suitable for developing predictive models due to its richness and real-time applicability. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid Transformer-LSTM model significantly outperforms the standard LSTM model, achieving Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 1.18, 1.70, and 2.00 at forecasting intervals of 15, 30, and 45 minutes, respectively. This research underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in the proactive management of diabetes, a critical step toward mitigating its impact. "

In this research, we utilize the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose and denoise DM data. Using DWT, we enhance heart rate variability (HRV) based DM diagnosis, data visualization of the disparities in Human Microbiome Project (HMP) data (gut bacteria, metabolomics, proteomics, RNA sequencing, targeted proteomics, and transcriptomics data) using demographic features, and insulin resistance prediction. We also attempt to forecast continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) ahead by 90 minutes because CGM is unable to provide real-time blood glucose measurements. We achieve 91.9% diagnosis accuracy for Type 1 DM using Random Forest on data transformed with DWT, holding the potential for usage in clinics. In addition, our DWT-based t-SNE and UMAP explorative analysis of HMP data support subtypes of prediabetic patients stratified by sex, race, and age. Moreover, DWT-based transformations provide multi-view clustering that any other methods would not provide on metabolomics, proteomics, RNA sequencing, targeted proteomics, and transcriptomics data and outperform those without DWT. Taken together, DWT-based machine learning approaches enable a fine resolution of subtyping DM towards precision medicine. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses Bayesian deep learning with incremental cross-domain adaptation for retinal fundus and OCT images, achieving high accuracy on diabetic retinopathy among other pathologies; includes few‑shot learning and multi‑modal imaging but lacks federated learning, explicit bias analysis, or detailed clinical deployment discussion.","Retinopathy represents a group of retinal diseases that, if not treated timely, can cause severe visual impairments or even blindness. Many researchers have developed autonomous systems to recognize retinopathy via fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imagery. However, most of these frameworks employ conventional transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches, requiring a decent amount of well-annotated training data to produce accurate diagnostic performance. This paper presents a novel incremental cross-domain adaptation instrument that allows any deep classification model to progressively learn abnormal retinal pathologies in OCT and fundus imagery via few-shot training. Furthermore, unlike its competitors, the proposed instrument is driven via a Bayesian multi-objective function that not only enforces the candidate classification network to retain its prior learned knowledge during incremental training but also ensures that the network understands the structural and semantic relationships between previously learned pathologies and newly added disease categories to effectively recognize them at the inference stage. The proposed framework, evaluated on six public datasets acquired with three different scanners to screen thirteen retinal pathologies, outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors by achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.9826 and 0.9846, respectively."

This focus is reflected in conference topics, strategy documents, technology appraisals and funding streams. What is often overlooked is the wider application of data and AI, as demonstrated through published literature and emerging marketplace products, that offers promising avenues for enhanced clinical care, health-service efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This review provides an overview of AI techniques and explores the use and potential of AI and data-driven systems in a broad context, covering all diabetes types, encompassing: (1) patient education and self-management; (2) clinical decision support systems and predictive analytics, including diagnostic support, treatment and screening advice, complications prediction; and (3) the use of multimodal data, such as imaging or genetic data. The review provides a perspective on how data- and AI-driven systems could transform diabetes care in the coming years and how they could be integrated into daily clinical practice. We discuss evidence for benefits and potential harms, and consider existing barriers to scalable adoption, including challenges related to data availability and exchange, health inequality, clinician hesitancy and regulation. Stakeholders, including clinicians, academics, commissioners, policymakers and those with lived experience, must proactively collaborate to realise the potential benefits that AI-supported diabetes care could bring, whilst mitigating risk and navigating the challenges along the way.

Objective This study determined diabetes risk factors among older adults aged ≥60 years using machine learning algorithms and selected an optimized prediction model. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on 3084 older adults aged ≥60 years in Seoul from January to November 2023. Data were collected using a mobile app (Gosufit) that measured depression, stress, anxiety, basal metabolic rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and average daily step count. Health coordinators recorded data on diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, percent body fat, and percent muscle. The presence of diabetes was the target variable, with various health indicators as predictors. Machine learning algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting model, light gradient boosting model, extreme gradient boosting model, and k-nearest neighbors, were employed for analysis. The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs) were used for model interpretability. Results Significant predictors of diabetes included hypertension ( χ ² 1 =197.294; P &lt;.001), hyperlipidemia ( χ ² 1 =47.671; P &lt;.001), age (mean: diabetes group 72.66 years vs nondiabetes group 71.81 years), stress (mean: diabetes group 42.68 vs nondiabetes group 41.47; t 3082 =−2.858; P =.004), and heart rate (mean: diabetes group 75.05 beats/min vs nondiabetes group 73.14 beats/min; t 3082 =−7.948; P &lt;.001). The extreme gradient boosting model (XGBM) demonstrated the best performance, with an accuracy of 84.88%, precision of 77.92%, recall of 66.91%, F1 score of 72.00, and AUC of 0.7957. The SHAP analysis of the top-performing XGBM revealed key predictors for diabetes: hypertension, age, percent body fat, heart rate, hyperlipidemia, basal metabolic rate, stress, and oxygen saturation. Hypertension strongly increased diabetes risk, while advanced age and elevated stress levels also showed significant associations. Hyperlipidemia and higher heart rates further heightened diabetes probability. These results highlight the importance and directional impact of specific features in predicting diabetes, providing valuable insights for risk stratification and targeted interventions. Conclusions This study focused on modifiable risk factors, providing crucial data for establishing a system for the automated collection of health information and lifelog data from older adults using digital devices at service facilities.

It is the most prevalent disease that significantly impacts the population. Although there are numerous possible causes of diabetes, age, excessive body fat, frailty, fast weight loss, and many other conditions are the ones that occur most often. Diabetes patients are more susceptible to developing a number of diseases, including heart disease, kidney issues, damaged nerves, damaged blood vessels, and blindness. It is challenging to diagnose the ailment, and it is both costly and difficult to anticipate how it will develop. Machine learning (ML) offers tremendous potential to develop useful applications for earlier detection, diagnosis, and therapy, as well as the treatment of many disorders, which is why medical experts are particularly interested in it. This study aims to develop a model that can reliably and precisely identify diabetes. Following that, association rule mining was employed to find the common indications of diabetic symptoms. This study also presents a useful model for diabetes prediction that makes use of various machine-learning approaches to improve diabetes categorization and increase the precision of diabetes prediction. Machine learning methods utilized in the early stage diabetes prediction include Gaussian Naive Bayes, ExtraTreesClassifier, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The choice of the dataset's major attribute was then made after considering a total of six different ways. Then, a total of 10 alternative models utilized for early-stage diabetes prediction were applied to the previously selected and highlighted dataset. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure are some of the metrics used to evaluate the various performance levels of these models. The performance matrices show that the ExtraTreesClassifier performed at the maximum level possible, earning a perfect score in each area with accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score of 100%. Therefore, we can assert that the performance of our ExtraTreesClassifier model is superior to that of the already available work. Clinical doctors who read this article will gain new knowledge and be better able to identify early diabetes."

Here we show that prediabetes is characterized by metabolic heterogeneity, and that metabolic subphenotypes can be predicted by the shape of the glucose curve measured via a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) during standardized oral glucose-tolerance tests (OGTTs) performed in at-home settings. Gold-standard metabolic tests in 32 individuals with early glucose dysregulation revealed dominant or co-dominant subphenotypes (muscle or hepatic insulin-resistance phenotypes in 34% of the individuals, and β-cell-dysfunction or impaired-incretin-action phenotypes in 40% of them). Machine-learning models trained with glucose time series from OGTTs from the 32 individuals predicted the subphenotypes with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 95% for muscle insulin resistance, 89% for β-cell deficiency and 88% for impaired incretin action. With CGM-generated glucose curves obtained during at-home OGTTs, the models predicted the muscle-insulin-resistance and β-cell-deficiency subphenotypes of 29 individuals with AUCs of 88% and 84%, respectively. At-home identification of metabolic subphenotypes via a CGM may aid the risk stratification of individuals with early glucose dysregulation. "

AI component is present but not detailed as deep learning, and safety focus provides limited trustworthiness discussion.","Effective blood glucose management is an increasing demand worldwide. Traditional solutions separate glucose detection and insulin delivery, which is less efficient compared to emerging closed-loop wearable systems controlled by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGM-controlled systems raise new safety risks, as false CGMs readings can cause insulin overdose, which results in hypoglycemia and fatal consequences. This work proposes a concept of a dual closed-loop insulin delivery system (DuoLoop) to mitigate the risk issue of CGM-controlled systems. The first closed-loop is automated insulin delivery controlled by CGM. The second closed-loop is the controlled release of glucose-responsive insulin (GRI), whose release rate depends on actual glucose levels. A customized algorithm is trained and embedded into the wearable CGMs for edge computing. The DuoLoop system shows improved safety in preliminary in vivo test (longer normoglycemia durations, 98.82% vs 92.10%), encouraging its deployment toward precision diabetes care."

Various data analysis methods, including machine learning such as neural networks, Gaussian Process Classification (GPC), and deep learning, have been used to enhance illness management and forecast accuracy. One of the included studies created customised care plans and used data to forecast the likelihood of complications in diabetes.. Another focused on comparative approaches for diabetes diagnosis using artificial intelligence, while others explored disease classification techniques using GPC algorithms. On the other hand, some studies utilized deep learning to identify diverse trajectories of type 2 diabetes from routine medical records, while others developed wide and deep learning models to predict diabetes onset. This review notes that data analysis approaches have significantly advanced accuracy in diagnosis, predictive modeling, and disease management of diabetes. Integrating these technologies allows for more personalized treatment approaches, where patient data can tailor individualized care strategies. Study findings indicate that machine learning and deep learning applications not only enhance prediction accuracy but also unlock new potentials in identifying risk factors, managing complications, and preventing diseases. Thus, this review provides profound insights into how data analysis has shifted paradigms in diabetes management, extending beyond diagnosis and treatment to encompass prevention and long-term management of chronic diseases.

As AI increasingly empowers patients and providers, its widespread success still depends on ongoing work, including thorough validation, outcome-based metrics, and improved workflow integration. The next decade will reveal whether AI in retina care transitions from a promising innovation to an essential and indispensable tool in modern retina. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses causal Bayesian networks and probability trees with SHAP for interpretable predictions; applies framework to a diabetes dataset, enabling intervention modeling, but lacks multimodal, imaging, federated, or bias analyses.","Healthcare decision-making requires not only accurate predictions but also insights into how factors influence patient outcomes. While traditional machine learning (ML) models excel at predicting outcomes, such as identifying high-risk patients, they are limited in addressing ""what if"" questions about interventions. This study introduces the Probabilistic Causal Fusion (PCF) framework, which integrates Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) and Probability Trees (PTrees) to extend beyond predictions. PCF leverages causal relationships from CBNs to structure PTrees, enabling both the quantification of factor impacts and the simulation of hypothetical interventions. The framework is evaluated on three clinically diverse, real-world datasets, MIMIC-IV, Framingham Heart Study, and BRFSS (Diabetes), demonstrating consistent predictive performance comparable to conventional ML models, while offering enhanced interpretability and causal reasoning capabilities. In contrast to conventional approaches focused solely on prediction, PCF offers a unified framework for prediction, intervention modelling, and counterfactual analysis, forming a holistic toolkit for clinical decision support. To enhance interpretability, PCF incorporates sensitivity analysis and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Sensitivity analysis quantifies the influence of causal parameters on outcomes such as Length of Stay (LOS), Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), and Diabetes, while SHAP highlights the importance of individual features in predictive modelling. This dual-layered interpretability offers both macro-level insights into causal pathways and micro-level explanations for individual predictions. By combining causal reasoning with predictive modelling, PCF bridges the gap between clinical intuition and data-driven insights. Its ability to uncover relationships between modifiable factors and simulate hypothetical scenarios provides clinicians with a clearer understanding of causal pathways. This approach supports more informed, evidence-based decision-making, offering a robust framework for addressing complex questions in diverse healthcare settings."

Recent studies showed that the Multisensor provides useful information about glucose dynamics with a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 35.4% in a fully prospective setting. Here we propose a method that, exploiting the same Multisensor measurements, but in a retrospective setting, achieves a much better accuracy. Data acquired by the Multisensor during a long-term study are retrospectively processed following a two-step procedure. First, the raw data are transformed to a blood glucose (BG) estimate by a multiple linear regression model. Then, an enhancing module is applied in cascade to the regression model to improve the accuracy of the glucose estimation by retrofitting available BG references through a time-varying linear model. MARD between the retrospectively reconstructed BG time-series and reference values is 20%. Here, 94% of values fall in zone A or B of the Clarke Error Grid. The proposed algorithm achieved a level of accuracy that could make this device a potential complementary tool for diabetes management and also for guiding prediabetic or nondiabetic users through life-style changes."

However, the integration of such technologies in the clinical setting poses significant challenges related to safety, security, and compliance with sensitive patient data, as well as the potential direct consequences on patient health. This article provides guidance for developers and researchers on identifying and addressing these safety, security, and compliance challenges in AI systems for diabetes management. We emphasize the role of explainable AI (xAI) systems as the foundational strategy for ensuring security and compliance, fostering user trust, and informed clinical decision-making which is paramount in diabetes care solutions. The article examines both the technical and regulatory dimensions essential for developing explainable applications in this field. Technically, we demonstrate how understanding the lifecycle phases of AI systems aids in constructing xAI frameworks while addressing security concerns and implementing risk mitigation strategies at each stage. In addition, from a regulatory perspective, we analyze key Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) standards established by entities, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), providing specific guidelines to ensure safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity in AI-enabled diabetes care applications. By addressing these interconnected aspects, this article aims to deliver actionable insights and methodologies for developing trustworthy AI-enabled diabetes care solutions while ensuring safety, efficacy, and compliance with ethical standards to enhance patient engagement and improve clinical outcomes.

These innovative technologies have substantially impacted the healthcare field and have played a vital role in improving the quality of life on a global scale. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained popularity as a technique to create universally shareable models using the vast datasets collected from IoMT devices, all while preserving data privacy. However, the intricate variations in IoMT environments, including diverse devices, data characteristics, and model complexities, pose challenges to the straightforward application of traditional FL methods. Consequently, it is not ideally suited for deployment in such contexts. This paper introduces FedCure, a personalized FL framework tailored for intelligent IoMT-based healthcare applications operating within a cloud-edge architecture. FedCure is adept at addressing the challenges within IoMT environments by employing personalized FL techniques that can effectively mitigate the impact of heterogeneity. Furthermore, the integration of edge computing technology enhances processing speed and minimizes latency in intelligent IoMT applications. Lastly, this research showcases several case studies encompassing IoMT-based applications, such as Eye Retinopathy Detection, Diabetes Monitoring, Maternal Health, Remote Health Monitoring, and Human Activity Recognition. These case studies provide a means to assess the effectiveness of the proposed FedCure framework and showcase exceptional performance with accuracy and minimal communication overhead, especially in addressing the challenges posed by heterogeneity.

In particular, the direct correlation between obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular, and heart disease is analyzed by using machine learning (ML) predictive models, while the connection of the co-occurring disorders to the numerous additional non-communicable diseases is analyzed via a graph-based user interface. The CDSS here proposed is, therefore, structured with three main components: ML predictive models based on publicly available datasets, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) local and global model interpretation, and graph-based representation of non-communicable disease connections. Multiple ML models are presented for risk assessment and a comparison is carried out based on performance key performance indicators. The best-performing model for each disease was proved to be: the multi-layer perceptron for diabetes and heart disease, and extreme gradient boosting for cardiovascular disease. Comorbidities risk factor prediction and a XAI local model explanation is performed on significant case studies. In addition, XAI global model interpretation is given for the entire dataset providing insights on the features’ contribution to the models’ implementation. Moreover, the graph-based visualization of indirect disease co-occurrence is performed by filtering connections according to different relative risk factor thresholds. This interface can be exploited by healthcare professionals to obtain, according to the needs and the clinical approach, a global perspective on obesity and its associated pathologies prevention as well as long-term treatment and care provision.

- **Reasoning:** Uses test-time adaptation and Fourier domain tricks for robust classification; includes diabetic retinopathy images as a case study but focuses on general robustness, not clinical decision support.","Deep classifiers may encounter significant performance degradation when processing unseen testing data from varying centers, vendors, and protocols. Ensuring the robustness of deep models against these domain shifts is crucial for their widespread clinical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach called Fourier Test-time Adaptation (FTTA), which employs a dual-adaptation design to integrate input and model tuning, thereby jointly improving the model robustness. The main idea of FTTA is to build a reliable multi-level consistency measurement of paired inputs for achieving self-correction of prediction. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we encourage consistency in global features and local attention maps between the two transformed images of the same input. Here, the transformation refers to Fourier-based input adaptation, which can transfer one unseen image into source style to reduce the domain gap. Furthermore, we leverage style-interpolated images to enhance the global and local features with learnable parameters, which can smooth the consistency measurement and accelerate convergence. Second, we introduce a regularization technique that utilizes style interpolation consistency in the frequency space to encourage self-consistency in the logit space of the model output. This regularization provides strong self-supervised signals for robustness enhancement. FTTA was extensively validated on three large classification datasets with different modalities and organs. Experimental results show that FTTA is general and outperforms other strong state-of-the-art methods. "

AI has several branches, such as machine learning and deep learning, which can add intelligence to applications. Machine learning is the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to improve automatically through experience. Deep learning algorithms learn from an extensive, multi-layered collection of interconnected processes and expose these processors to many examples. In the coming years, the integration of AI in routine medical care is expected to revolutionize Medicine, potentially improving patient care and quality of life. The time required for a diagnosis can be greatly reduced, and diagnostic efficiency can be significantly enhanced when AI assists clinicians. Large language model chatbots are capable of clinical expert-level medical note-taking, consultation, and questionanswering. Chatbotscan generate human-like text, may help diagnose diseases based on medical records, and may suggest treatment options or plans. Artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated remarkable progress in radiological image analysis and diagnosis and may improve radiologists’ efficiency. These algorithms may also improve diagnostic accuracy in dermatology, histopathology, fundoscopy, endoscopy, and other medical images. Natural language processing and ambient clinical intelligence automate administrative duties like recording patient visits in electronic health records, streamlining clinical workflow, and freeing up doctors to spend more time with patients. AI may also help with new drug discoveries, precision medicine, and clinical research. AI developments can revolutionize several healthcare-related fields and pave the way for a more individualized, accurate, predictive, and portable future.

However, creating multimodal models and determining model performance are challenging tasks given the multi-factored nature of diabetes. For both unimodal and multimodal models, there are also concerns of bias with the lack of external validations and representation of race, age, and gender in training data.

Participating institutions might not contribute equally, some contribute more data, some better quality data or some more diverse data. To fairly rank the contribution of different institutions, Shapley value (SV) has emerged as the method of choice. Exact SV computation is impossibly expensive, especially when there are hundreds of contributors. Existing SV computation techniques use approximations. However, in healthcare where the number of contributing institutions are likely not of a colossal scale, computing exact SVs is still exorbitantly expensive, but not impossible. For such settings, we propose an efficient SV computation technique called SaFE (Shapley Value for Federated Learning using Ensembling). We empirically show that SaFE computes values that are close to exact SVs, and that it performs better than current SV approximations. This is particularly relevant in medical imaging setting where widespread heterogeneity across institutions is rampant and fast accurate data valuation is required to determine the contribution of each participant in multi-institutional collaborative learning."

We leverage RadNet-12M, a dataset containing more than 12 million computed tomography (CT) image slices, to explore the efficacy of self-supervised pretraining on medical and natural images. Our experiments cover intra- and cross-domain transfer scenarios, varying data scales, finetuning vs. linear evaluation, and feature space analysis.

These features can be identified through computer vision techniques including deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) models. We aim to construct a DL model that can predict systemic features from fundus images and to determine the optimal method of model construction for this task. Data were collected from a cohort of patients undergoing diabetic retinopathy screening between March 2020 and March 2021. Two models were created for each of 12 systemic health features based on the DenseNet201 architecture: one utilizing transfer learning with images from ImageNet and another from 35,126 fundus images. Here, 1277 fundus images were used to train the AI models. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) scores were used to compare the model performance. Models utilizing the ImageNet transfer learning data were superior to those using retinal images for transfer learning (mean AUROC 0.78 vs. 0.65, p-value < 0.001). Models using ImageNet pretraining were able to predict systemic features including ethnicity (AUROC 0.93), age > 70 (AUROC 0.90), gender (AUROC 0.85), ACE inhibitor (AUROC 0.82), and ARB medication use (AUROC 0.78). We conclude that fundus images contain valuable information about the systemic characteristics of a patient.

Covers transfer learning fully, mentions multimodal, federated, bias, and clinical considerations only in general survey context.","Machine learning techniques used in computer-aided medical image analysis usually suffer from the domain shift problem caused by different distributions between source/reference data and target data. As a promising solution, domain adaptation has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The aim of this paper is to survey the recent advances of domain adaptation methods in medical image analysis. We first present the motivation of introducing domain adaptation techniques to tackle domain heterogeneity issues for medical image analysis. Then we provide a review of recent domain adaptation models in various medical image analysis tasks. We categorize the existing methods into shallow and deep models, and each of them is further divided into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. We also provide a brief summary of the benchmark medical image datasets that support current domain adaptation research. This survey will enable researchers to gain a better understanding of the current status, challenges and future directions of this energetic research field."

No diabetes focus, but includes bias analysis and medical imaging relevance.","Deep learning (DL) reconstruction particularly of MRI has led to improvements in image fidelity and reduction of acquisition time. In neuroimaging, DL methods can reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled data. However, it is essential to consider fairness in DL algorithms, particularly in terms of demographic characteristics. This study presents the first fairness analysis in a DL-based brain MRI reconstruction model. The model utilises the U-Net architecture for image reconstruction and explores the presence and sources of unfairness by implementing baseline Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM) and rebalancing strategies. Model performance is evaluated using image reconstruction metrics. Our findings reveal statistically significant performance biases between the gender and age subgroups. Surprisingly, data imbalance and training discrimination are not the main sources of bias. This analysis provides insights of fairness in DL-based image reconstruction and aims to improve equity in medical AI applications."

Current federated learning approaches suffer from static architectures, slow convergence (45-73 rounds), fairness gaps marginalizing smaller institutions, and scalability constraints (15-client limit). We propose Adaptive Fair Federated Learning (AFFL) through three innovations: (1) Adaptive Knowledge Messengers dynamically scaling capacity based on heterogeneity and task complexity, (2) Fairness-Aware Distillation using influence-weighted aggregation, and (3) Curriculum-Guided Acceleration reducing rounds by 60-70%. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees with epsilon-fairness bounds, achieving O(T^{-1/2}) + O(H_max/T^{3/4}) rates. Projected results show 55-75% communication reduction, 56-68% fairness improvement, 34-46% energy savings, and 100+ institution support. The framework enables multi-modal integration across imaging, genomics, EHR, and sensor data while maintaining HIPAA/GDPR compliance. We propose MedFedBench benchmark suite for standardized evaluation across six healthcare dimensions: convergence efficiency, institutional fairness, privacy preservation, multi-modal integration, scalability, and clinical deployment readiness. Economic projections indicate 400-800% ROI for rural hospitals and 15-25% performance gains for academic centers. This work presents a seven-question research agenda, 24-month implementation roadmap, and pathways toward democratizing healthcare AI."

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning and XAI for ECG arrhythmia classification, achieving high accuracy and providing interpretable results for clinicians, but has no diabetes focus or related data modalities.","Deep learning play a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using the electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models normally requires a large amount of data and it can lead to privacy concerns. Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health systems. In this paper, we design a new explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based deep learning framework in a federated setting for ECG-based healthcare applications. The federated setting is used to solve issues such as data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework setting effectively classifies arrhythmia's using an autoencoder and a classifier, both based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier to explain the classification results, which help clinical practitioners make quick and reliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The classifier achieved accuracy up to 94% and 98% for arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with five-fold cross-validation."

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning and feature-statistics augmentation to improve 3D medical image segmentation; addresses privacy but has no diabetes focus or multimodal/fairness analysis.","Federated learning (FL) enables multiple client medical institutes collaboratively train a deep learning (DL) model with privacy protection. However, the performance of FL can be constrained by the limited availability of labeled data in small institutes and the heterogeneous (i.e., non-i.i.d.) data distribution across institutes. Though data augmentation has been a proven technique to boost the generalization capabilities of conventional centralized DL as a ""free lunch"", its application in FL is largely underexplored. Notably, constrained by costly labeling, 3D medical segmentation generally relies on data augmentation. In this work, we aim to develop a vicinal feature-level data augmentation (VFDA) scheme to efficiently alleviate the local feature shift and facilitate collaborative training for privacy-aware FL segmentation. We take both the inner- and inter-institute divergence into consideration, without the need for cross-institute transfer of raw data or their mixup. Specifically, we exploit the batch-wise feature statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) in each institute to abstractly represent the discrepancy of data, and model each feature statistic probabilistically via a Gaussian prototype, with the mean corresponding to the original statistic and the variance quantifying the augmentation scope. From the vicinal risk minimization perspective, novel feature statistics can be drawn from the Gaussian distribution to fulfill augmentation. The variance is explicitly derived by the data bias in each individual institute and the underlying feature statistics characterized by all participating institutes. The added-on VFDA consistently yielded marked improvements over six advanced FL methods on both 3D brain tumor and cardiac segmentation."

- **Reasoning:** Uses XAI methods to explain CDSS outputs, enhancing trust and interpretability; however, it does not focus on diabetes, nor apply AI to diabetic problems, and lacks multimodal, federated, imaging, or transfer‑learning components.","Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) more broadly have great immediate and future potential for transforming almost all aspects of medicine. However, in many applications, even outside medicine, a lack of transparency in AI applications has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly pronounced where users need to interpret the output of AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) provides a rationale that allows users to understand why a system has produced a given output. The output can then be interpreted within a given context. One area that is in great need of XAI is that of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). These systems support medical practitioners in their clinic decision-making and in the absence of explainability may lead to issues of under or over-reliance. Providing explanations for how recommendations are arrived at will allow practitioners to make more nuanced, and in some cases, life-saving decisions. The need for XAI in CDSS, and the medical field in general, is amplified by the need for ethical and fair decision-making and the fact that AI trained with historical data can be a reinforcement agent of historical actions and biases that should be uncovered. We performed a systematic literature review of work to-date in the application of XAI in CDSS. Tabular data processing XAI-enabled systems are the most common, while XAI-enabled CDSS for text analysis are the least common in literature. There is more interest in developers for the provision of local explanations, while there was almost a balance between post-hoc and ante-hoc explanations, as well as between model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. Studies reported benefits of the use of XAI such as the fact that it could enhance decision confidence for clinicians, or generate the hypothesis about causality, which ultimately leads to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of the system and potential for its incorporation in the clinical workflow. However, we found an overall distinct lack of application of XAI in the context of CDSS and, in particular, a lack of user studies exploring the needs of clinicians. We propose some guidelines for the implementation of XAI in CDSS and explore some opportunities, challenges, and future research needs."

Applies to medical imaging, includes bias study, hints at domain adaptation, but lacks multimodal, federated, or diabetes‑specific components.","Abstract As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly approaches human-level performance in medical imaging, it is crucial that it does not exacerbate or propagate healthcare disparities. Previous research established AI’s capacity to infer demographic data from chest X-rays, leading to a key concern: do models using demographic shortcuts have unfair predictions across subpopulations? In this study, we conducted a thorough investigation into the extent to which medical AI uses demographic encodings, focusing on potential fairness discrepancies within both in-distribution training sets and external test sets. Our analysis covers three key medical imaging disciplines—radiology, dermatology and ophthalmology—and incorporates data from six global chest X-ray datasets. We confirm that medical imaging AI leverages demographic shortcuts in disease classification. Although correcting shortcuts algorithmically effectively addresses fairness gaps to create ‘locally optimal’ models within the original data distribution, this optimality is not true in new test settings. Surprisingly, we found that models with less encoding of demographic attributes are often most ‘globally optimal’, exhibiting better fairness during model evaluation in new test environments. Our work establishes best practices for medical imaging models that maintain their performance and fairness in deployments beyond their initial training contexts, underscoring critical considerations for AI clinical deployments across populations and sites.

In real-world applications such as hospitals and industries, FL counters the challenges of data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity as an inevitable part of the collaborative training. More specifically, different organizations, such as hospitals, have their own private data and customized models for local training. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods do not effectively address both problems of model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we exploit the data and model heterogeneity simultaneously, and propose a method, MDH-FL (Exploiting Model and Data Heterogeneity in FL) to solve such problems to enhance the efficiency of the global model in FL. We use knowledge distillation and a symmetric loss to minimize the heterogeneity and its impact on the model performance. Knowledge distillation is used to solve the problem of model heterogeneity, and symmetric loss tackles with the data and label heterogeneity. We evaluate our method on the medical datasets to conform the real-world scenario of hospitals, and compare with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the other existing methods."

- **Reasoning:** Uses domain adaptation and federated learning methods; focuses on general medical imaging (MRI/CT) and bias mitigation, but does not target diabetes applications.","Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform data analysis in many domains. Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. (1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. (2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. (3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives. "

However, existing fair FL methods ignore the specific characteristics of medical FL applications, i.e., domain shift among the datasets from different hospitals. In this work, we propose Fed-LWR to improve performance fairness from the perspective of feature shift, a key issue influencing the performance of medical FL systems caused by domain shift. Specifically, we dynamically perceive the bias of the global model across all hospitals by estimating the layer-wise difference in feature representations between local and global models. To minimize global divergence, we assign higher weights to hospitals with larger differences. The estimated client weights help us to re-aggregate the local models per layer to obtain a fairer global model. We evaluate our method on two widely used federated medical image segmentation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves better and fairer performance compared with several state-of-the-art fair FL methods."

However, the large global community of healthcare professionals, many of whom routinely face potentially life-or-death outcomes with complex medicolegal consequences, have yet to embrace this powerful technology. The major problem is that most current AI solutions function as a metaphorical black-box positioned between input data and output decisions without a rigorous explanation for their internal processes. With the goal of enhancing trust and improving acceptance of AI-based technology in clinical medicine, there is a large and growing effort to address this challenge using eXplainable AI (XAI), a set of techniques, strategies, and algorithms with an explicit focus on explaining the “hows and whys” of DNNs.

In FL, the model is trained and shared across decentralized locations where data are privately owned. After local training, model updates are sent back to a central server, thus enabling access to distributed data on a large scale while maintaining privacy, security, and data access rights. Although FL is a well-studied topic, existing frameworks are still at an early stage of development. They encounter challenges with respect to scalability, data security, aggregation methodologies, data provenance, and production readiness. In this paper, we propose a novel FL framework that supports functionalities like scalable processing with respect of data, devices, sites and collaborators, monitoring services, privacy, and support for use cases. Furthermore, we integrate multi party computation (MPC) within the FL setup, preventing reverse engineering attacks. The proposed framework has been evaluated in diverse use cases both in cross-device and cross-silo settings. In the former case, in-device FL is leveraged in the context of an AI-driven internet of medical things (IoMT) environment.

AI algorithms have the potential to mitigate cognitive biases in human interpretation, but extensive research has highlighted the tendency of AI systems to internalize biases within their model. This fact, whether intentional or not, may ultimately lead to unintentional consequences in the clinical setting, potentially compromising patient outcomes. This concern is particularly important in medical imaging, where AI has been more progressively and widely embraced than any other medical field. A comprehensive understanding of bias at each stage of the AI pipeline is therefore essential to contribute to developing AI solutions that are not only less biased but also widely applicable. This international collaborative review effort aims to increase awareness within the medical imaging community about the importance of proactively identifying and addressing AI bias to prevent its negative consequences from being realized later. The authors began with the fundamentals of bias by explaining its different definitions and delineating various potential sources. Strategies for detecting and identifying bias were then outlined, followed by a review of techniques for its avoidance and mitigation. Moreover, ethical dimensions, challenges encountered, and prospects were discussed. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated, secure AI for medical imaging, detailing privacy safeguards and deployment concerns, but does not target diabetes or related clinical applications.","The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy. In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory. Here we present an overview of current and next-generation methods for federated, secure and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence with a focus on medical imaging applications, alongside potential attack vectors and future prospects in medical imaging and beyond. Medical imaging data is often subject to privacy and intellectual property restrictions. AI techniques can help out by offering tools like federated learning to bridge the gap between personal data protection and data utilisation for research and clinical routine, but these tools need to be secure."

To mitigate bias concerns during model development, we surveyed recent publications on different debiasing methods in the fields of biomedical natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision (CV).

However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats. Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems."

In this context, auditing fairness of deep segmentation models becomes crucial. However, such audit process generally requires access to ground-truth segmentation masks for the target population, which may not always be available, especially when going from development to deployment. Here we propose a new method to anticipate model biases in biomedical image segmentation in the absence of ground-truth annotations. Our unsupervised bias discovery method leverages the reverse classification accuracy framework to estimate segmentation quality. Through numerical experiments in synthetic and realistic scenarios we show how our method is able to successfully anticipate fairness issues in the absence of ground-truth labels, constituting a novel and valuable tool in this field."

No diabetes focus, no multimodal or federated methods, and only general imaging relevance.","Bias in health care has been well documented and results in disparate and worsened outcomes for at-risk groups. Medical imaging plays a critical role in facilitating patient diagnoses but involves multiple sources of bias including factors related to access to imaging modalities, acquisition of images, and assessment (ie, interpretation) of imaging data. Machine learning (ML) applied to diagnostic imaging has demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of imaging-based diagnosis and the precision of measuring imaging-based traits. Algorithms can leverage subtle information not visible to the human eye to detect underdiagnosed conditions or derive new disease phenotypes by linking imaging features with clinical outcomes, all while mitigating cognitive bias in interpretation. Importantly, however, the application of ML to diagnostic imaging has the potential to either reduce or propagate bias. Understanding the potential gain as well as the potential risks requires an understanding of how and what ML models learn. Common risks of propagating bias can arise from unbalanced training, suboptimal architecture design or selection, and uneven application of models. Notwithstanding these risks, ML may yet be applied to improve gain from imaging across all 3A's (access, acquisition, and assessment) for all patients. In this review, we present a framework for understanding the balance of opportunities and challenges for minimizing bias in medical imaging, how ML may improve current approaches to imaging, and what specific design considerations should be made as part of efforts to maximize the quality of health care for all."

- **Reasoning:** Uses domain‑adaptation to unlearn study bias in medical images, promoting generalizable models; however, it does not target diabetes, so AI‑for‑Diabetes criteria are unmet.","Medical imaging machine learning algorithms are usually evaluated on a single dataset. Although training and testing are performed on different subsets of the dataset, models built on one study show limited capability to generalize to other studies. While database bias has been recognized as a serious problem in the computer vision community, it has remained largely unnoticed in medical imaging research. Transfer learning thus remains confined to the re-use of feature representations requiring re-training on the new dataset. As a result, machine learning models do not generalize even when trained on imaging datasets that were captured to study the same variable of interest. The ability to transfer knowledge gleaned from one study to another, without the need for re-training, if possible, would provide reassurance that the models are learning knowledge fundamental to the problem under study instead of latching onto the idiosyncracies of a dataset. In this paper, we situate the problem of dataset bias in the context of medical imaging studies. We show empirical evidence that such a problem exists in medical datasets. We then present a framework to unlearn study membership as a means to handle the problem of database bias. Our main idea is to take the data from the original feature space to an intermediate space where the data points are indistinguishable in terms of which study they come from, while maintaining the recognition capability with respect to the variable of interest. This will promote models which learn the more general properties of the etiology under study instead of aligning to dataset-specific peculiarities. Essentially, our proposed model learns to unlearn the dataset bias."

Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning."

In particular, with respect to the federated aggregation procedure, researchers have been focusing on the study of secure aggregation (SA) schemes to provide privacy guarantees over the model's parameters transmitted by the clients. Nevertheless, the practical availability of SA in currently available FL frameworks is currently limited, due to computational and communication bottlenecks. To fill this gap, this study explores the implementation of SA within the open-source Fed-BioMed framework. We implement and compare two SA protocols, Joye-Libert (JL) and Low Overhead Masking (LOM), by providing extensive benchmarks in a panel of healthcare data analysis problems. Our theoretical and experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate that SA protocols effectively protect privacy while maintaining task accuracy. Computational overhead during training is less than 1% on a CPU and less than 50% on a GPU for large models, with protection phases taking less than 10 seconds. Incorporating SA into Fed-BioMed impacts task accuracy by no more than 2% compared to non-SA scenarios. Overall this study demonstrates the feasibility of SA in real-world healthcare applications and contributes in reducing the gap towards the adoption of privacy-preserving technologies in sensitive applications."

Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with electronic health records (EHRs) holds transformative potential to improve healthcare. However, addressing bias in AI, which risks worsening healthcare disparities, cannot be overlooked. This study reviews methods to handle various biases in AI models developed using EHR data.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, analyzing articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE published between January 01, 2010 and December 17, 2023. The review identified key biases, outlined strategies for detecting and mitigating bias throughout the AI model development, and analyzed metrics for bias assessment.


RESULTS
Of the 450 articles retrieved, 20 met our criteria, revealing 6 major bias types: algorithmic, confounding, implicit, measurement, selection, and temporal. The AI models were primarily developed for predictive tasks, yet none have been deployed in real-world healthcare settings. Five studies concentrated on the detection of implicit and algorithmic biases employing fairness metrics like statistical parity, equal opportunity, and predictive equity. Fifteen studies proposed strategies for mitigating biases, especially targeting implicit and selection biases. These strategies, evaluated through both performance and fairness metrics, predominantly involved data collection and preprocessing techniques like resampling and reweighting.


DISCUSSION
This review highlights evolving strategies to mitigate bias in EHR-based AI models, emphasizing the urgent need for both standardized and detailed reporting of the methodologies and systematic real-world testing and evaluation. Such measures are essential for gauging models' practical impact and fostering ethical AI that ensures fairness and equity in healthcare."

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep learning for multimodal medical image segmentation; focuses on fusion strategies and imaging, but does not address diabetes, clinical decision support, or privacy/fairness aspects.","Multi-modality is widely used in medical imaging, because it can provide multiinformation about a target (tumor, organ or tissue). Segmentation using multimodality consists of fusing multi-information to improve the segmentation. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have presented the state-of-the-art performance in image classification, segmentation, object detection and tracking tasks. Due to their self-learning and generalization ability over large amounts of data, deep learning recently has also gained great interest in multi-modal medical image segmentation. In this paper, we give an overview of deep learning-based approaches for multi-modal medical image segmentation task. Firstly, we introduce the general principle of deep learning and multi-modal medical image segmentation. Secondly, we present different deep learning network architectures, then analyze their fusion strategies and compare their results. The earlier fusion is commonly used, since it's simple and it focuses on the subsequent segmentation network architecture. However, the later fusion gives more attention on fusion strategy to learn the complex relationship between different modalities. In general, compared to the earlier fusion, the later fusion can give more accurate result if the fusion method is effective enough. We also discuss some common problems in medical image segmentation. Finally, we summarize and provide some perspectives on the future research."

We argue that these principles should form the foundational design criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data, including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis) enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability. By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and translatable to real-world clinical settings."

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning and gradient‑based personalization for medical image segmentation; no diabetes data or application, so core AI technique fits but diabetes relevance is absent.","Federated learning (FL) allows multiple medical institutions to collaboratively learn a global model without centralizing client data. It is difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve optimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of medical images from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem becomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients outside the FL with unseen distributions not presented during federated training. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for medical imaging tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both \textit{Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL} (IOP-FL). Our inside personalization uses a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the local adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients for common knowledge and the local gradients for client-specific optimization. Moreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the global model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize an adapted model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing scheme using the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically incorporate the models, given the distribution information conveyed by the test data. Our extensive experimental results on two medical image segmentation tasks present significant improvements over SOTA methods on both inside and outside personalization, demonstrating the potential of our IOP-FL scheme for clinical practice."

However, there are two critical challenges. Firstly, user data often exists in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Secondly, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this paper, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds personalized models by transfer learning. It is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. Experiments demonstrate that FedHealth produces higher accuracy (5.3% improvement) for wearable activity recognition when compared to traditional methods. FedHealth is general and extensible and has the potential to be used in many healthcare applications."

No diabetes focus, no federated or bias analysis.","This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning model for risk stratification of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with carotid atherosclerosis, with CHD presence/absence defined as the target outcome variable. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 442 patients diagnosed with carotid atherosclerosis at a tertiary hospital in China between January 1, 2022, and June 20, 2025. Patients were divided into CHD and non-CHD groups based on clinical outcomes. Data encompassing demographics, laboratory results, and vascular imaging findings were collected. Feature selection involved logistic regression (LR), identifying 5 key predictors: age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and the presence of carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Seven machine learning algorithms (LR, XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and stacking ensemble) were trained and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, with metrics including area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Model interpretability was evaluated using Shapley Additive Explanations, while clinical utility was determined through calibration and decision curve analysis. All models demonstrated satisfactory performance, with the LR model achieving the highest area under the curve of 0.838 on the testing set, indicating balanced sensitivity and specificity. Shapley Additive Explanations analysis identified carotid plaque and TIA as the most influential predictors. Calibration and decision curve analysis curves indicated strong agreement between predicted and observed risks, leading to a significant clinical net benefit. An interpretable LR model incorporating age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, TIA, and carotid plaque enables reliable CHD risk stratification among patients with carotid atherosclerosis. This model serves as a practical, explainable tool for individualized risk assessment and early clinical decision support in this high-risk population."

Federated learning allows for the utilization of powerful machine learning algorithms without requiring the pooling of data. Healthcare data have many simultaneous challenges, such as highly siloed data, class imbalance, missing data, distribution shifts, and non-standardized variables, that require new methodologies to address. Federated learning adds significant methodological complexity to conventional centralized machine learning, requiring distributed optimization, communication between nodes, aggregation of models, and redistribution of models. In this systematic review, we consider all papers on Scopus published between January 2015 and February 2023 that describe new federated learning methodologies for addressing challenges with healthcare data. We reviewed 89 papers meeting these criteria. Significant systemic issues were identified throughout the literature, compromising many methodologies reviewed. We give detailed recommendations to help improve methodology development for federated learning in healthcare. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning and domain-aware representation to handle heterogeneous medical data; however, it does not target diabetes, so AI‑for‑Diabetes and related clinical decision aspects are absent.","Cross-silo Federated learning (FL) has become a promising tool in machine learning applications for healthcare. It allows hospitals/institutions to train models with sufficient data while the data is kept private. To make sure the FL model is robust when facing heterogeneous data among FL clients, most efforts focus on personalizing models for clients. However, the latent relationships between clients' data are ignored. In this work, we focus on a special non-iid FL problem, called Domain-mixed FL, where each client's data distribution is assumed to be a mixture of several predefined domains. Recognizing the diversity of domains and the similarity within domains, we propose a novel method, FedDAR, which learns a domain shared representation and domain-wise personalized prediction heads in a decoupled manner. For simplified linear regression settings, we have theoretically proved that FedDAR enjoys a linear convergence rate. For general settings, we have performed intensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets which demonstrate its superiority over prior FL methods."

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep learning multimodal fusion of imaging and EHR, offering implementation guidelines; however, it does not focus on diabetes, nor apply AI to diabetic problems, and only briefly touches on clinical decision aspects.","Advancements in deep learning techniques carry the potential to make significant contributions to healthcare, particularly in fields that utilize medical imaging for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging."

A large database of fundus photographs (n = 14,822) from a racially and ethnically diverse group of individuals (over 33% of African descent) was evaluated by expert reviewers and classified as GON or healthy. Several deep learning architectures and the impact of transfer learning were evaluated. The best performing model achieved an overall area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.91 in distinguishing GON eyes from healthy eyes. It also achieved an AUC of 0.97 for identifying GON eyes with moderate-to-severe functional loss and 0.89 for GON eyes with mild functional loss. A sensitivity of 88% at a set 95% specificity was achieved in detecting moderate-to-severe GON. In all cases, transfer improved performance and reduced training time. Model visualizations indicate that these deep learning models relied on, in part, anatomical features in the inferior and superior regions of the optic disc, areas commonly used by clinicians to diagnose GON. The results suggest that deep learning-based assessment of fundus images could be useful in clinical decision support systems and in the automation of large-scale glaucoma detection and screening programs."

However, even the most advanced methods require a huge and diverse amount of data to generalize. Because in realistic clinical scenarios, data acquisition and annotation is expensive, deep learning models trained on small and unrepresentative data tend to outperform when deployed in data that differs from the one used for training (e.g data from different scanners). In this work, we proposed a domain adaptation methodology to alleviate this problem in segmentation models. Our approach takes advantage of the properties of adversarial domain adaptation and consistency training to achieve more robust adaptation. Using two datasets with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) annotations, we demonstrated that the proposed method improves model generalization even in corner cases where individual strategies tend to fail.

Trend arrows are the only way to look into the future, but they are often too imprecise for therapy adjustment. While AID systems provide algorithms to use glucose values for glucose control, this has not been possible with stand-alone CGM systems, which are most used by people with diabetes. By analyzing the measured values with algorithms, often supported by AI, this should be possible in the future. This provides the user with important information about the further course of the glucose level, such as during the night. Predictive approaches can be used by next-generation CGM systems. These systems can proactively prevent glucose events such as hypo- or hyperglycemia. With the Accu-Chek® SmartGuide Predict app, an integral part of a novel CGM system, and the Glucose Predict (GP) feature, people with diabetes have the first commercially available CGM system with predictive algorithms. It characterizes the CGM systems of the future, which not only analyze past values and current glucose values in the future, but also use these values to predict future glucose progression. "

Currently, no dedicated public medical datasets with imaging data for fairness learning are available, though minority groups suffer from more health issues. To address this gap, we introduce Harvard Glaucoma Fairness (Harvard-GF), a retinal nerve disease dataset including 3,300 subjects with both 2D and 3D imaging data and balanced racial groups for glaucoma detection. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally with Blacks having doubled glaucoma prevalence than other races. We also propose a fair identity normalization (FIN) approach to equalize the feature importance between different identity groups. Our FIN approach is compared with various state-of-the-art fairness learning methods with superior performance in the racial, gender, and ethnicity fairness tasks with 2D and 3D imaging data, demonstrating the utilities of our dataset Harvard-GF for fairness learning. To facilitate fairness comparisons between different models, we propose an equity-scaled performance measure, which can be flexibly used to compare all kinds of performance metrics in the context of fairness.

- **Reasoning:** Uses affirmative algorithms to argue fairness of final clinical decisions; discusses bias mitigation and ethical evaluation, but does not address diabetes, specific modalities, or federated learning.","The use of machine learning systems for decision-support in healthcare may exacerbate health inequalities. However, recent work suggests that algorithms trained on sufficiently diverse datasets could in principle combat health inequalities. One concern about these algorithms is that their performance for patients in traditionally disadvantaged groups exceeds their performance for patients in traditionally advantaged groups. This renders the algorithmic decisions unfair relative to the standard fairness metrics in machine learning. In this paper, we defend the permissible use of affirmative algorithms; that is, algorithms trained on diverse datasets that perform better for traditionally disadvantaged groups. Whilst such algorithmic decisions may be unfair, the fairness of algorithmic decisions is not the appropriate locus of moral evaluation. What matters is the fairness of final decisions, such as diagnoses, resulting from collaboration between clinicians and algorithms. We argue that affirmative algorithms can permissibly be deployed provided the resultant final decisions are fair. "

Given the resource limitations often encountered by LMICs, collaboration becomes crucial for pooling resources, expertise, and knowledge. Despite the apparent advantages, ensuring the fairness and equity of these collaborative models is essential, especially considering the distinct differences between LMIC and HIC hospitals. In this study, we show that collaborative AI approaches can lead to divergent performance outcomes across HIC and LMIC settings, particularly in the presence of data imbalances. Through a real-world COVID-19 screening case study, we demonstrate that implementing algorithmic-level bias mitigation methods significantly improves outcome fairness between HIC and LMIC sites while maintaining high diagnostic sensitivity. We compare our results against previous benchmarks, utilizing datasets from four independent United Kingdom Hospitals and one Vietnamese hospital, representing HIC and LMIC settings, respectively. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses curriculum-based Fourier domain adaptation to improve segmentation robustness across modalities; however, it does not target diabetes or related clinical decision contexts.","Accurate and robust medical image segmentation is fundamental and crucial for enhancing the autonomy of computer-aided diagnosis and intervention systems. Medical data collection normally involves different scanners, protocols, and populations, making domain adaptation (DA) a highly demanding research field to alleviate model degradation in the deployment site. To preserve the model performance across multiple testing domains, this work proposes the Curriculum-based Augmented Fourier Domain Adaptation (Curri-AFDA) for robust medical image segmentation. In particular, our curriculum learning strategy is based on the causal relationship of a model under different levels of data shift in the deployment phase, where the higher the shift is, the harder to recognize the variance. Considering this, we progressively introduce more amplitude information from the target domain to the source domain in the frequency space during the curriculum-style training to smoothly schedule the semantic knowledge transfer in an easier-to-harder manner. Besides, we incorporate the training-time chained augmentation mixing to help expand the data distributions while preserving the domain-invariant semantics, which is beneficial for the acquired model to be more robust and generalize better to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on two segmentation tasks of Retina and Nuclei collected from multiple sites and scanners suggest that our proposed method yields superior adaptation and generalization performance. Meanwhile, our approach proves to be more robust under various corruption types and increasing severity levels. In addition, we show our method is also beneficial in the domain-adaptive classification task with skin lesion datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/lofrienger/Curri-AFDA. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses contrastive disentanglement and style augmentation for generalizable medical image segmentation; no diabetes focus, but strong domain adaptation and imaging methods.","Generalization to previously unseen images with potential domain shifts and different styles is essential for clinically applicable medical image segmentation, and the ability to disentangle domain-specific and domain-invariant features is key for achieving Domain Generalization (DG). However, existing DG methods can hardly achieve effective disentanglement to get high generalizability. To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient Contrastive Domain Disentanglement and Style Augmentation (CDDSA) framework for generalizable medical image segmentation. First, a disentangle network is proposed to decompose an image into a domain-invariant anatomical representation and a domain-specific style code, where the former is sent to a segmentation model that is not affected by the domain shift, and the disentangle network is regularized by a decoder that combines the anatomical and style codes to reconstruct the input image. Second, to achieve better disentanglement, a contrastive loss is proposed to encourage the style codes from the same domain and different domains to be compact and divergent, respectively. Thirdly, to further improve generalizability, we propose a style augmentation method based on the disentanglement representation to synthesize images in various unseen styles with shared anatomical structures. Our method was validated on a public multi-site fundus image dataset for optic cup and disc segmentation and an in-house multi-site Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Magnetic Resonance Image (NPC-MRI) dataset for nasopharynx Gross Tumor Volume (GTVnx) segmentation. Experimental results showed that the proposed CDDSA achieved remarkable generalizability across different domains, and it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in domain-generalizable segmentation.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are progressively being used to improve diabetes care, while many health care providers lack awareness and knowledge about CDSSs in diabetes care. A comprehensive analysis of the applications of CDSSs in diabetes care is still lacking. Objective This review aimed to summarize the research landscape, clinical applications, and impact on both patients and physicians of CDSSs in diabetes care. Methods We conducted a scoping review following the Arksey and O’Malley framework. A search was conducted in 7 electronic databases to identify the clinical applications of CDSSs in diabetes care up to June 30, 2022. Additional searches were conducted for conference abstracts from the period of 2021-2022. Two researchers independently performed the screening and data charting processes. Results Of 11,569 retrieved studies, 85 (0.7%) were included for analysis. Research interest is growing in this field, with 45 (53%) of the 85 studies published in the past 5 years. Among the 58 (68%) out of 85 studies disclosing the underlying decision-making mechanism, most CDSSs (44/58, 76%) were knowledge based, while the number of non-knowledge-based systems has been increasing in recent years. Among the 81 (95%) out of 85 studies disclosing application scenarios, the majority of CDSSs were used for treatment recommendation (63/81, 78%). Among the 39 (46%) out of 85 studies disclosing physician user types, primary care physicians (20/39, 51%) were the most common, followed by endocrinologists (15/39, 39%) and nonendocrinology specialists (8/39, 21%). CDSSs significantly improved patients’ blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profiles in 71% (45/63), 67% (12/18), and 38% (8/21) of the studies, respectively, with no increase in the risk of hypoglycemia. Conclusions CDSSs are both effective and safe in improving diabetes care, implying that they could be a potentially reliable assistant in diabetes care, especially for physicians with limited experience and patients with limited access to medical resources.

Although many ML models perform promisingly, issues with model transparency and interpretability limit their adoption in clinical practice. Directly using existing explainable ML techniques in clinical settings can be challenging. Through literature surveys and collaborations with six clinicians with an average of 17 years of clinical experience, we identified three key challenges, including clinicians' unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need for cohort-level evidence. Following an iterative design process, we further designed and developed VBridge, a visual analytics tool that seamlessly incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature explanations and enriched interactions that connect the dots between ML features, explanations, and data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of VBridge through two case studies and expert interviews with four clinicians, showing that visually associating model explanations with patients' situational records can help clinicians better interpret and use model predictions when making clinician decisions. We further derived a list of design implications for developing future explainable ML tools to support clinical decision-making. "

In particular, we evaluated our model for the task of rapidly predicting COVID-19 for patients presenting to hospital emergency departments and aimed to mitigate any site (hospital)-specific and ethnicity-based biases present in the data. Using a specialized reward function and training procedure, we show that our method achieves clinically effective screening performances, while significantly improving outcome fairness compared with current benchmarks and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. We performed external validation across three independent hospitals, and additionally tested our method on a patient intensive care unit discharge status task, demonstrating model generalizability. "

First, we analyze the interpretability of deep learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior performance at the cost of introducing bias.

No diabetes focus, so core diabetes criteria are unmet.","Using large, multi-national datasets for high-performance medical imaging AI systems requires innovation in privacy-preserving machine learning so models can train on sensitive data without requiring data transfer. Here we present PriMIA (Privacy-preserving Medical Image Analysis), a free, open-source software framework for differentially private, securely aggregated federated learning and encrypted inference on medical imaging data. We test PriMIA using a real-life case study in which an expert-level deep convolutional neural network classifies paediatric chest X-rays; the resulting model’s classification performance is on par with locally, non-securely trained models. We theoretically and empirically evaluate our framework’s performance and privacy guarantees, and demonstrate that the protections provided prevent the reconstruction of usable data by a gradient-based model inversion attack. Finally, we successfully employ the trained model in an end-to-end encrypted remote inference scenario using secure multi-party computation to prevent the disclosure of the data and the model. Gaining access to medical data to train AI applications can present problems due to patient privacy or proprietary interests. A way forward can be privacy-preserving federated learning schemes.

Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those biases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at ameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact of biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this framework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical imaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with known disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by using three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated bias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of biases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a novel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation strategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of clinical AI that is robust and responsible."

In this article, we propose FedHealth 2, an extension of FedHealth \cite{chen2020fedhealth} to tackle domain shifts and get personalized models for local clients. FedHealth 2 obtains the client similarities via a pretrained model, and then it averages all weighted models with preserving local batch normalization.

Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems."

However, such decision-making procedures can be subjective, qualitative, and have large inter-subject variabilities. With the recent advances in multimodal deep learning technologies, an increasingly large number of efforts have been devoted to a key question: how do we extract and aggregate multimodal information to ultimately provide more objective, quantitative computer-aided clinical decision making?

In healthcare systems, FL allows Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) devices and electronic health records (EHRs) to be trained locally without sending patients data to the central server. This allows healthcare decisions and diagnoses based on datasets from all participants, as well as streamlining other healthcare processes. In terms of user data privacy, this technology allows collaborative training without the need of sharing the local data with the central server. However, there are privacy challenges in FL arising from the fact that the model updates are shared between the client and the server which can be used for re-generating the client’s data, breaching privacy requirements of applications in domains like healthcare. In this paper, we have conducted a review of the literature to analyse the existing privacy and security enhancement methods proposed for FL in healthcare systems. It has been identified that the research in the domain focuses on seven techniques: Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, Blockchain, Hierarchical Approaches, Peer to Peer Sharing, Intelligence on the Edge Device, and Mixed, Hybrid and Miscellaneous Approaches. The strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of each technique were discussed, and the possible future for these seven privacy enhancement techniques for healthcare FL systems was identified. "

Using three types of explainable methods applied to the same medical image data set, we aimed to improve the comprehensibility of the decisions provided by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In vivo gastral images obtained by a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) were the subject of visual explanations, with the goal of increasing health professionals’ trust in black-box predictions. We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that, with future improvements in implementation, can be generalized to different medical data sets and can provide effective decision support to medical experts."

DL needs more data and diversity to build a more accurate system. To satisfy these requirements, more data need to be pooled at the centralized server to train the model deeply, but the process of pooling faces privacy and regulatory challenges. To settle them, the concept of sharing model learning rather than sharing data through federated learning (FL) is proposed. FL creates a more reliable system without transferring data to the server, resulting in the right system with stronger security and access rights to data that protect privacy. This research aims to (1) provide a literature review and an in-depth study on the roles of FL in the fields of healthcare; (2) highlight the effectiveness of current challenges facing standardized FL, including statistical data heterogeneity, privacy and security concerns, expensive communications, limited resources, and efficiency; and (3) present lists of open research challenges and recommendations for future FL for the academic and industrial sectors in telemedicine and remote healthcare applications. An extensive review of the literature on FL from a data-centric perspective was conducted. We searched the Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed databases for publications published between January 2018 and February 2023. A new crossover matching between the approaches that solve or mitigate all types of skewed data has been proposed to open up opportunities to other researchers. In addition, a list of various applications was organized by learning application task types such as prediction, diagnosis, and classification.

This study tackles these concerns by thoroughly re-examining AI-driven segmentation for hip and knee bony anatomy. While advanced imaging modalities like CT and MRI offer comprehensive views, plain radiographs (X-rays) predominate the standard initial clinical assessment due to their widespread availability, low cost, and rapid acquisition. Hence, we focused on plain radiographs to ensure the utilization of our contribution in diverse healthcare settings, including those with limited access to advanced imaging technologies. This work provides insights into the underlying causes of biases in AI-based knee and hip image segmentation through an extensive evaluation, presenting targeted mitigation strategies to alleviate biases related to sex, race, and age, using an automatic segmentation that is fair, impartial, and safe in the context of AI.

Two critical challenges are identified: First, medical data is naturally distributed across multiple local sites, making it difficult to collectively train machine learning models without data leakage. Second, in medical applications, data are often collected from different sources and views, resulting in heterogeneity and complexity that requires reconciliation. In this article, we present a generic Federated Multi-view Learning (FedMV) framework for multi-view data leakage prevention. Specifically, we apply this framework to two types of problems based on local data availability: Vertical Federated Multi-view Learning (V-FedMV) and Horizontal Federated Multi-view Learning (H-FedMV). We experimented with real-world keyboard data collected from BiAffect study. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach can make full use of multi-view data in a privacy-preserving way, and both V-FedMV and H-FedMV perform better than their single-view and pairwise counterparts. Besides, the framework can be easily adapted to deal with multi-view sequential data. We have developed a sequential model (S-FedMV) that takes sequence of multi-view data as input and demonstrated it experimentally. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to consider both vertical and horizontal diversification in the multi-view setting, as well as their sequential federated learning. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep segmentation models and domain adaptation to study adult‑to‑pediatric lung X‑rays; no diabetes focus, but addresses generalization and trust issues in medical imaging.","Lung segmentation in chest X-rays (CXRs) is an important prerequisite for improving the specificity of diagnoses of cardiopulmonary diseases in a clinical decision support system. Current deep learning models for lung segmentation are trained and evaluated on CXR datasets in which the radiographic projections are captured predominantly from the adult population. However, the shape of the lungs is reported to be significantly different across the developmental stages from infancy to adulthood. This might result in age-related data domain shifts that would adversely impact lung segmentation performance when the models trained on the adult population are deployed for pediatric lung segmentation. In this work, our goal is to (i) analyze the generalizability of deep adult lung segmentation models to the pediatric population and (ii) improve performance through a stage-wise, systematic approach consisting of CXR modality-specific weight initializations, stacked ensembles, and an ensemble of stacked ensembles. To evaluate segmentation performance and generalizability, novel evaluation metrics consisting of mean lung contour distance (MLCD) and average hash score (AHS) are proposed in addition to the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), the intersection of union (IoU), Dice score, 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95), and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD). Our results showed a significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cross-domain generalization through our approach. This study could serve as a paradigm to analyze the cross-domain generalizability of deep segmentation models for other medical imaging modalities and applications. "

However, due to the complex healthcare system and data privacy concerns, aggregating and utilizing these data in a centralized manner can be challenging. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for distributed training in edge computing scenarios, utilizing on-device user data while reducing server costs. In traditional FL, a central server trains a global model sampled client data randomly, and the server combines the collected model from different clients into one global model. However, for not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) datasets, randomly selecting users to train server is not an optimal choice and can lead to poor model training performance. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Multi-Center Clustering algorithm (FedMCC) to enhance the robustness and accuracy for all clients. FedMCC leverages the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, focusing on training a robust base model during the initial training phase and better capturing features from different users. Subsequently, clustering methods are used to ensure that features among users within each cluster are similar, approximating an i.i.d. training process in each round, resulting in more effective training of the global model. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FedMCC through extensive experiments on public healthcare datasets. The results demonstrate that FedMCC achieves improved performance and accuracy for all clients while maintaining data privacy and security, showcasing its potential for various healthcare applications.

Notably, compared to existing approaches, SLIViT can be applied even when only a small number of annotated training samples is available, which is often a constraint in medical applications. When trained on less than 700 annotated volumes, SLIViT obtained accuracy comparable to trained clinical specialists while reducing annotation time by a factor of 5,000 demonstrating its utility to automate and expedite ongoing research and other practical clinical scenarios.

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning with differential privacy for histopathology images, demonstrating strong privacy guarantees and comparable performance; however, it does not involve diabetes, lacks bias/fairness analysis, and focuses on single-modality imaging rather than multimodal diabetic data.","The artificial intelligence revolution has been spurred forward by the availability of large-scale datasets. In contrast, the paucity of large-scale medical datasets hinders the application of machine learning in healthcare. The lack of publicly available multi-centric and diverse datasets mainly stems from confidentiality and privacy concerns around sharing medical data. To demonstrate a feasible path forward in medical image imaging, we conduct a case study of applying a differentially private federated learning framework for analysis of histopathology images, the largest and perhaps most complex medical images. We study the effects of IID and non-IID distributions along with the number of healthcare providers, i.e., hospitals and clinics, and the individual dataset sizes, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, a public repository, to simulate a distributed environment. We empirically compare the performance of private, distributed training to conventional training and demonstrate that distributed training can achieve similar performance with strong privacy guarantees. We also study the effect of different source domains for histopathology images by evaluating the performance using external validation. Our work indicates that differentially private federated learning is a viable and reliable framework for the collaborative development of machine learning models in medical image analysis. "

Deep learning (DL)-based data fusion strategies are a popular approach for modeling these nonlinear relationships. Therefore, we review the current state-of-the-art of such methods and propose a detailed taxonomy that facilitates more informed choices of fusion strategies for biomedical applications, as well as research on novel methods. By doing so, we find that deep fusion strategies often outperform unimodal and shallow approaches. Additionally, the proposed subcategories of fusion strategies show different advantages and drawbacks. The review of current methods has shown that, especially for intermediate fusion strategies, joint representation learning is the preferred approach as it effectively models the complex interactions of different levels of biological organization. Finally, we note that gradual fusion, based on prior biological knowledge or on search strategies, is a promising future research path. Similarly, utilizing transfer learning might overcome sample size limitations of multimodal data sets. As these data sets become increasingly available, multimodal DL approaches present the opportunity to train holistic models that can learn the complex regulatory dynamics behind health and disease."

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks.

FL has been utilized by several researchers for preserving the privacy of Electronic Health Record (EHR) information while updating the global server. Still, the privacy and higher number of communication rounds limit the performance of the model. Hence, this research introduces the privacy-preserving EHR information sharing technique, FL, based on deep Q reinforcement learning with spectral clustering (FL+DQRE-SCnet). In this, the local healthcare information is trained using the DCNN in the respective hospitals based on FL criteria. After learning the local model, the information is shared with the global model for updating the EHR to enhance the accuracy of disease diagnosis. The global model aggregates the information from the local models over several communication rounds by randomly selecting the local models, increasing the need for more communication rounds. Therefore, DQRE-SCnet is introduced before data aggregation to minimize the communication rounds. In addition, including a homomorphic encryption technique ensures privacy protection for FL data sharing. The analysis of FL+DQRE-SCnet based on the assessment measures of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure acquired maximal values of 95%, 94.9%, 94.94%, and 93.94%, respectively. Also, the error rate of 0.46 and the execution time of 1400 sec are accomplished by the FL+DQRE-SCnet method. Here, for comparing the performance of the model, the baseline methods like FedAvg, LoAdaBoost, BOFRF, PP-FedAvg and AdaFed are considered, wherein the proposed method acquired superior performance.

To develop and evaluate a data-driven process to generate suggestions for improving alert criteria using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches.


METHODS
We extracted data on alerts generated from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We developed machine learning models to predict user responses to alerts. We applied XAI techniques to generate global explanations and local explanations. We evaluated the generated suggestions by comparing with alert's historical change logs and stakeholder interviews. Suggestions that either matched (or partially matched) changes already made to the alert or were considered clinically correct were classified as helpful.


RESULTS
The final dataset included 2 991 823 firings with 2689 features. Among the 5 machine learning models, the LightGBM model achieved the highest Area under the ROC Curve: 0.919 [0.918, 0.920]. We identified 96 helpful suggestions. A total of 278 807 firings (9.3%) could have been eliminated. Some of the suggestions also revealed workflow and education issues.


CONCLUSION
We developed a data-driven process to generate suggestions for improving alert criteria using XAI techniques. Our approach could identify improvements regarding clinical decision support (CDS) that might be overlooked or delayed in manual reviews. It also unveils a secondary purpose for the XAI: to improve quality by discovering scenarios where CDS alerts are not accepted due to workflow, education, or staffing issues."

- **Reasoning:** Uses SHAP‑based model compression to create explainable CDSS for ACS mortality; strong AI/ML and trustworthiness focus, but no diabetes content or related modalities.","In everyday clinical practice, medical decision is currently based on clinical guidelines which are often static and rigid, and do not account for population variability, while individualized, patient-oriented decision and/or treatment are the paradigm change necessary to enter into the era of precision medicine. Most of the limitations of a guideline-based system could be overcome through the adoption of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. However, the black-box nature of AI algorithms has hampered a large adoption of AI-based CDSSs in clinical practice. In this study, an innovative AI-based method to compress AI-based prediction models into explainable, model-agnostic, and reduced decision support systems (NEAR) with application to healthcare is presented and validated. NEAR is based on the Shapley Additive Explanations framework and can be applied to complex input models to obtain the contributions of each input feature to the output. Technically, the simplified NEAR models approximate contributions from input features using a custom library and merge them to determine the final output. Finally, NEAR estimates the confidence error associated with the single input feature contributing to the final score, making the result more interpretable. Here, NEAR is evaluated on a clinical real-world use case, the mortality prediction in patients who experienced Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), applying three different Machine Learning/Deep Learning models as implementation examples. NEAR, when applied to the ACS use case, exhibits performances like the ones of the AI-based model from which it is derived, as in the case of the Adaptive Boosting classifier, whose Area Under the Curve is not statistically different from the NEAR one, even the model's simplification. Moreover, NEAR comes with intrinsic explainability and modularity, as it can be tested on the developed web application platform (https://neardashboard.pythonanywhere.com/). An explainable and reliable CDSS tailored to single-patient analysis has been developed. The proposed AI-based system has the potential to be used alongside the clinical guidelines currently employed in the medical setting making them more personalized and dynamic and assisting doctors in taking their everyday clinical decisions.

A drawback of using these methods for high-dimensional datasets is that they often lead to high-dimensional explanation output that hinders human analysis. This is especially true for explaining multimodal ML models, where the problem’s complexity is further exacerbated by the inclusion of multiple data modalities and an increase in the overall number of features. This work proposes a novel approach to lower the complexity of feature-based explanations. The proposed approach is based on uncertainty quantification techniques, allowing for a principled way of reducing the number of modalities required to explain the model’s predictions. We evaluated our method in three multimodal datasets comprising physiological time series. Results show that the proposed method can reduce the complexity of the explanations while maintaining a high level of accuracy in the predictions. This study illustrates an innovative example of the intersection between the disciplines of uncertainty quantification and explainable AI. "

However, given the complexity of medical decisions, it is crucial that results generated by AI tools not only be correct but also carefully evaluated, understandable, and explainable to end-users, especially clinicians. The lack of interpretability in communicating AI clinical decisions can lead to mistrust among decision-makers and a reluctance to use these technologies. This paper systematically reviews the processes and challenges associated with interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) within the healthcare and medical domains. Its main goals are to examine the processes of IML and XAI, their related methods, applications, and the implementation challenges they pose in digital health interventions (DHIs), particularly from a quality control perspective, to help understand and improve communication between AI systems and clinicians. The IML process is categorized into pre-processing interpretability, interpretable modeling, and post-processing interpretability. This paper aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the significance of a robust interpretability approach in clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by reviewing related experimental results. The goal is to provide future researchers with insights for creating clinician-AI tools that are more communicable in healthcare decision support systems and offer a deeper understanding of their challenges. Our research questions, eligibility criteria, and primary goals were proved using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) method. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using sensitive and specific search strings. Subsequently, duplicate papers were removed using EndNote and Covidence. A two-phase selection process was then carried out on Covidence, starting with screening by title and abstract, followed by a full-text appraisal. The Meta Quality Appraisal Tool (MetaQAT) was used to assess the quality and risk of bias. Finally, a standardized data extraction tool was employed for reliable data mining. The searches yielded 2,241 records, from which 555 duplicate papers were removed. During the title and abstract screening step, 958 papers were excluded, and the full-text review step excluded 482 studies. Subsequently, in quality and risk of bias assessment, 172 papers were removed. 74 publications were selected for data extraction, which formed 10 insightful reviews and 64 related experimental studies. The paper provides general definitions of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the medical domain and introduces a framework for interpretability in clinical decision support systems structured across three levels. It explores XAI-related health applications within each tier of this framework, underpinned by a review of related experimental findings. Furthermore, the paper engages in a detailed discussion of quality assessment tools for evaluating XAI in intelligent health systems. It also presents a step-by-step roadmap for implementing XAI in clinical settings. To direct future research toward bridging current gaps, the paper examines the importance of XAI models from various angles and acknowledges their limitations. "

In this paper, we introduce the FedHealthFog framework, which was meticulously developed to overcome the difficulties of distributed learning in resource-constrained IoT-enabled healthcare systems, particularly those sensitive to delays and energy efficiency. Conventional federated learning approaches face challenges stemming from substantial compute requirements and significant communication costs. This is primarily due to their reliance on a singular server for the aggregation of global data, which results in inefficient training models. We present a transformational approach to address these problems by elevating strategically placed fog nodes to the position of local aggregators within the federated learning architecture. A sophisticated greedy heuristic technique is used to optimize the choice of a fog node as the global aggregator in each communication cycle between edge devices and the cloud. The FedHealthFog system notably accounts for drop in communication latency of 87.01%, 26.90%, and 71.74%, and energy consumption of 57.98%, 34.36%, and 35.37% respectively, for three benchmark algorithms analyzed in this study. The effectiveness of FedHealthFog is strongly supported by outcomes of our experiments compared to cutting-edge alternatives while simultaneously reducing number of global aggregation cycles. These findings highlight FedHealthFog's potential to transform federated learning in resource-constrained IoT environments for delay-sensitive applications. "

This problem is exacerbated by the “opaque” nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety. "

insights from XAI literature while simultaneously addressing physicians’ needs. This design comprises
five design principles that designers of ML-based CDSSs can apply to implement user-centered

Machine learning provides an additional boost for this area. However, machine learning for medical image analysis is particularly vulnerable to natural biases like domain shifts that affect algorithmic performance and robustness. In this paper we analyze machine learning for medical image analysis within the framework of Technology Readiness Levels and review how causal analysis methods can fill a gap when creating robust and adaptable medical image analysis algorithms. We review methods using causality in medical imaging AI/ML and find that causal analysis has the potential to mitigate critical problems for clinical translation but that uptake and clinical downstream research has been limited so far.

With the increasing demand for data privacy, federated learning has emerged as a new paradigm, which enables distributed joint training of medical data sources without leaving the private domain. However, federated learning is suffering from security threats as the shared local model will reveal original datasets. Privacy leakage is even more fatal in healthcare because medical data contains critically sensitive information. In addition, open wireless channels are susceptible to malicious attacks. To further safeguard the privacy of IoMT, we propose a comprehensive privacy-preserving federated learning scheme with a tactful dropout handling mechanism. The proposed scheme leverages blind masking and certificateless proxy re-encryption (CL-PRE) for secure aggregation, ensuring the confidentiality of the local model and rendering the global model invisible to any parties other than clients. It also provides authentication of uploaded models while protecting identity privacy. Compared with other relevant schemes, our solution has better performance on functional features and efficiency, and is more applicable to IoMT systems with many devices."

- **Reasoning:** Uses fairness metrics and bias mitigation techniques for health‑care ML models; lacks any diabetes focus, but provides strong bias/fairness analysis and general ML methodology.","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in health care to aid clinical decisions is widespread. However, as AI and ML take important roles in health care, there are concerns about AI and ML associated fairness and bias. That is, an AI tool may have a disparate impact, with its benefits and drawbacks unevenly distributed across societal strata and subpopulations, potentially exacerbating existing health inequities. Thus, the objectives of this scoping review were to summarize existing literature and identify gaps in the topic of tackling algorithmic bias and optimizing fairness in AI/ML models using real-world data (RWD) in health care domains.We conducted a thorough review of techniques for assessing and optimizing AI/ML model fairness in health care when using RWD in health care domains. The focus lies on appraising different quantification metrics for accessing fairness, publicly accessible datasets for ML fairness research, and bias mitigation approaches.We identified 11 papers that are focused on optimizing model fairness in health care applications. The current research on mitigating bias issues in RWD is limited, both in terms of disease variety and health care applications, as well as the accessibility of public datasets for ML fairness research. Existing studies often indicate positive outcomes when using pre-processing techniques to address algorithmic bias. There remain unresolved questions within the field that require further research, which includes pinpointing the root causes of bias in ML models, broadening fairness research in AI/ML with the use of RWD and exploring its implications in healthcare settings, and evaluating and addressing bias in multi-modal data.This paper provides useful reference material and insights to researchers regarding AI/ML fairness in real-world health care data and reveals the gaps in the field. Fair AI/ML in health care is a burgeoning field that requires a heightened research focus to cover diverse applications and different types of RWD. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses explainable AI planning to improve decision support trustworthiness; however, it does not involve diabetes, multimodal data, federated learning, imaging, bias analysis, or transfer learning.","Intelligent decision support (IDS) systems leverage artificial intelligence techniques to generate recommendations that guide human users through the decision making phases of a task. However, a key challenge is that IDS systems are not perfect, and in complex real-world scenarios may produce suboptimal output or fail to work altogether. The field of explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that improve the interpretability of black-box systems. While most XAI work has focused on single-classification tasks, the subfield of explainable AI planning (XAIP) has sought to develop techniques that make sequential decision making AI systems explainable to domain experts. Critically, prior work in applying XAIP techniques to IDS systems has assumed that the plan being proposed by the planner is always optimal, and therefore the action or plan being recommended as decision support to the user is always optimal. In this work, we examine novice user interactions with a non-robust IDS system – one that occasionally recommends suboptimal actions, and one that may become unavailable after users have become accustomed to its guidance. We introduce a new explanation type, subgoal-based explanations, for plan-based IDS systems, that supplements traditional IDS output with information about the subgoal toward which the recommended action would contribute. We demonstrate that subgoal-based explanations lead to improved user task performance in the presence of IDS recommendations, improve user ability to distinguish optimal and suboptimal IDS recommendations, and are preferred by users. Additionally, we demonstrate that subgoal-based explanations enable more robust user performance in the case of IDS failure, showing the significant benefit of training users for an underlying task with subgoal-based explanations."

- **Reasoning:** Uses random forest and model‑agnostic explanation methods to interpret predictions for hypertension risk, aiding clinician trust; however, it does not involve diabetes or related modalities.","Although complex machine learning models are commonly outperforming the traditional simple interpretable models, clinicians find it hard to understand and trust these complex models due to the lack of intuition and explanation of their predictions. The aim of this study to demonstrate the utility of various model-agnostic explanation techniques of machine learning models with a case study for analyzing the outcomes of the machine learning random forest model for predicting the individuals at risk of developing hypertension based on cardiorespiratory fitness data. The dataset used in this study contains information of 23,095 patients who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 10-year follow-up. Five global interpretability techniques (Feature Importance, Partial Dependence Plot, Individual Conditional Expectation, Feature Interaction, Global Surrogate Models) and two local interpretability techniques (Local Surrogate Models, Shapley Value) have been applied to present the role of the interpretability techniques on assisting the clinical staff to get better understanding and more trust of the outcomes of the machine learning-based predictions. Several experiments have been conducted and reported. The results show that different interpretability techniques can shed light on different insights on the model behavior where global interpretations can enable clinicians to understand the entire conditional distribution modeled by the trained response function. In contrast, local interpretations promote the understanding of small parts of the conditional distribution for specific instances. Various interpretability techniques can vary in their explanations for the behavior of the machine learning model. The global interpretability techniques have the advantage that it can generalize over the entire population while local interpretability techniques focus on giving explanations at the level of instances. Both methods can be equally valid depending on the application need. Both methods are effective methods for assisting clinicians on the medical decision process, however, the clinicians will always remain to hold the final say on accepting or rejecting the outcome of the machine learning models and their explanations based on their domain expertise."

- **Reasoning:** Uses explainable AI and visualization to improve model interpretability for clinical adoption, but does not focus on diabetes or related data modalities.","In a short period of time, many areas of science have made a sharp transition towards data-dependent methods. In some cases, this process has been enabled by simultaneous advances in data acquisition and the development of networked system technologies. This new situation is particularly clear in the life sciences, where data overabundance has sparked a flurry of new methodologies for data management and analysis. This can be seen as a perfect scenario for the use of machine learning and computational intelligence techniques to address problems in which more traditional data analysis approaches might struggle. But, this scenario also poses some serious challenges. One of them is model interpretability and explainability, especially for complex nonlinear models. In some areas such as medicine and health care, not addressing such challenge might seriously limit the chances of adoption, in real practice, of computer-based systems that rely on machine learning and computational intelligence methods for data analysis. In this paper, we reflect on recent investigations about the interpretability and explainability of machine learning methods and discuss their impact on medicine and health care. We pay specific attention to one of the ways in which interpretability and explainability in this context can be addressed, which is through data and model visualization. We argue that, beyond improving model interpretability as a goal in itself, we need to integrate the medical experts in the design of data analysis interpretation strategies. Otherwise, machine learning is unlikely to become a part of routine clinical and health care practice."

Imaging relevance is indirect.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent, irreversible, chronic, and degenerative disorder whose diagnosis at the prodromal stage is critical. Mostly, single modality data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), are used to make predictions in AD studies. However, the metabolic and structural data fusion can provide a holistic view of AD-staging analysis. To achieve this objective, a novel multimodal fusion-based method is proposed in this article. An optimal fusion of MRI and PET is achieved by harnessing demon algorithm and discrete wavelet transform. Finally, the fused image features are extracted using ResNet-50, and these features are classified using robust energy least square twin support vector machine classifier. Experiments on the AD neuroimaging initiative dataset show descent accuracy of 97%, 94%, and 97.5% for cognitive normal (CN) versus AD, CN versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD versus MCI, respectively. The proposed model will be beneficial for health professionals in accurately diagnosing AD at an early stage."

- **Reasoning:** Uses reinforcement learning and neural networks to build a trust‑enhancing clinical decision‑support system, but focuses on heart failure, not diabetes, and lacks multimodal, federated, imaging, or fairness components.","Recent efforts in Machine Learning (ML) interpretability have focused on creating methods for explaining black-box ML models. However, these methods rely on the assumption that simple approximations, such as linear models or decision-trees, are inherently human-interpretable, which has not been empirically tested. Additionally, past efforts have focused exclusively on comprehension, neglecting to explore the trust component necessary to convince non-technical experts, such as clinicians, to utilize ML models in practice. In this paper, we posit that reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn what is interpretable to different users and, consequently, build their trust in ML models. To validate this idea, we first train a neural network to provide risk assessments for heart failure patients. We then design a RL-based clinical decision-support system (DSS) around the neural network model, which can learn from its interactions with users. We conduct an experiment involving a diverse set of clinicians from multiple institutions in three different countries. Our results demonstrate that ML experts cannot accurately predict which system outputs will maximize clinicians' confidence in the underlying neural network model, and suggest additional findings that have broad implications to the future of research into ML interpretability and the use of ML in medicine."

- **Reasoning:** Uses LIME to evaluate explanations for clinical classifiers, showing high clinician trust. No diabetes focus or related data modalities, so diabetes-specific criteria are not met.","The usage of black-box classification models within the healthcare field is highly dependent on being interpretable by the receiver. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) provides a patient-specific explanation for a given classification, thus enhancing the possibility for any complex classifier to serve as a safety aid within a clinical setting. However, research on if the explanation provided by LIME is relevant to clinicians is limited and there is no current framework for how an evaluation of LIME is to be performed. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the explanations provided by LIME, this study has investigated how physician's independent explanations for classified observations compare with explanations provided by LIME. Additionally, the clinical relevance and the experienced reliance on the explanations provided by LIME have been evaluated by field experts. The results indicate that the explanation provided by LIME is clinically relevant and has a very high concordance with the explanations provided by physicians. Furthermore, trust and reliance on LIME are fairly high amongst clinicians. The study proposes a framework for further research within the area."

However, in the case of sensitive healthcare datasets, additional privacy measures before feeding into machine learning mechanisms are also necessary. Our approach uses the federated learning framework, which removes the necessity of sharing patients' sensitive data in a raw format outside the premise. First, the data owners agree on a list of features selected by the correlation; then, after training the local models, the obtained local models are transmitted to the central server for aggregation. The differential privacy (DP) approach is adopted to perturb the local models before transmission to add an extra privacy layer. As a result, our framework achieves improved utility as the feature selection reduces the data dimension. Finally, based on the patient's genomic data, the framework establishes a practical healthcare application to privacy-predict certain heart failure/cancer diseases. application to predict certain heart failure diseases in a private manner."

However, data centralization for big data raises privacy and regulatory concerns.Covered topics include (1) an introduction to privacy of patient data and distributed learning as a potential solution to preserving these data, a description of the legal context for patient data research, and a definition of machine/deep learning concepts; (2) a presentation of the adopted review protocol; (3) a presentation of the search results; and (4) a discussion of the findings, limitations of the review, and future perspectives.Distributed learning from federated databases makes data centralization unnecessary. Distributed algorithms iteratively analyze separate databases, essentially sharing research questions and answers between databases instead of sharing the data. In other words, one can learn from separate and isolated datasets without patient data ever leaving the individual clinical institutes.Distributed learning promises great potential to facilitate big data for medical application, in particular for international consortiums. Our purpose is to review the major implementations of distributed learning in health care."

Its interdisciplinary nature can be challenging for new researchers to pick up. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing (to the best of our knowledge) the first survey on IFL. We propose a unique IFL taxonomy which covers relevant works enabling FL models to explain the prediction results, support model debugging, and provide insights into the contributions made by individual data owners or data samples, which in turn, is crucial for allocating rewards fairly to motivate active and reliable participation in FL. We conduct comprehensive analysis of the representative IFL approaches, the commonly adopted performance evaluation metrics, and promising directions towards building versatile IFL techniques."

No diabetes focus, no multimodal or federated methods, and limited clinical decision discussion beyond mental health.","A significant level of stigma and inequality exists in mental healthcare, especially in under-served populations. Inequalities are reflected in the data collected for scientific purposes. When not properly accounted for, machine learning (ML) models learned from data can reinforce these structural inequalities or biases. Here, we present a systematic study of bias in ML models designed to predict depression in four different case studies covering different countries and populations. We find that standard ML approaches regularly present biased behaviors. We also show that mitigation techniques, both standard and our own post-hoc method, can be effective in reducing the level of unfair bias. There is no one best ML model for depression prediction that provides equality of outcomes. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing fairness during model selection and transparent reporting about the impact of debiasing interventions. Finally, we also identify positive habits and open challenges that practitioners could follow to enhance fairness in their models. "

Glioma change detection aims at finding the relevant parts of the image that change over time. Although Deep Learning (DL) shows promising performances in similar change detection tasks, the creation of large annotated datasets represents a major bottleneck for supervised DL applications in radiology. To overcome this, we propose a combined use of weak labels (imprecise, but fast-to-create annotations) and Transfer Learning (TL). Specifically, we explore inductive TL, where source and target domains are identical, but tasks are different due to a label shift: our target labels are created manually by three radiologists, whereas our source weak labels are generated automatically from radiology reports via NLP. We frame knowledge transfer as hyperparameter optimization, thus avoiding heuristic choices that are frequent in related works. We investigate the relationship between model size and TL, comparing a low-capacity VGG with a higher-capacity ResNeXt model. We evaluate our models on 1693 T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging difference maps created from 183 patients, by classifying them into stable or unstable according to tumor evolution. The weak labels extracted from radiology reports allowed us to increase dataset size more than 3-fold, and improve VGG classification results from 75% to 82% AUC. Mixed training from scratch led to higher performance than fine-tuning or feature extraction. To assess generalizability, we ran inference on an open dataset (BraTS-2015: 15 patients, 51 difference maps), reaching up to 76% AUC. Overall, results suggest that medical imaging problems may benefit from smaller models and different TL strategies with respect to computer vision datasets, and that report-generated weak labels are effective in improving model performances. Code, in-house dataset and BraTS labels are released. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning with differential privacy to reduce communication and variance; no diabetes data or applications, limited clinical trust aspects beyond privacy.","The performance of federated learning systems is bottlenecked by communication costs and training variance. The communication overhead problem is usually addressed by three communication-reduction techniques, namely, model compression, partial device participation, and periodic aggregation, at the cost of increased training variance. Different from traditional distributed learning systems, federated learning suffers from data heterogeneity (since the devices sample their data from possibly different distributions), which induces additional variance among devices during training. Various variance-reduced training algorithms have been introduced to combat the effects of data heterogeneity, while they usually cost additional communication resources to deliver necessary control information. Additionally, data privacy remains a critical issue in FL and, thus, there have been attempts at bringing Differential Privacy to this framework as a mediator between utility and privacy requirements. This article investigates the tradeoffs between communication costs and training variance under a resource-constrained federated system theoretically and experimentally, and studies how communication reduction techniques interplay in a differentially private setting. The results provide important insights into designing practical privacy-aware federated learning systems. "

We examined privacy breaches in depth through privacy attack experiments and demonstrated that PPML-Omics could protect patients' privacy. In each of these applications, PPML-Omics was able to outperform methods of comparison under the same level of privacy guarantee, demonstrating the versatility of the method in simultaneously balancing the privacy-preserving capability and utility in omic data analysis. Furthermore, we gave the theoretical proof of the privacy-preserving capability of PPML-Omics, suggesting the first mathematically guaranteed method with robust and generalizable empirical performance in protecting patients' privacy in omic data.

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning with VAE and differential privacy for heart disease diagnosis; strong AI/ML and FL components, but no diabetes focus, limited clinical trust aspects, and no multimodal or imaging work.","The deep integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the medical industry has given birth to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). In IoMT, physicians treat a patient's disease by analyzing patient data collected through mobile devices with the assistance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered systems. However, the traditional AI technologies may lead to the leakage of patient privacy data due to its own design flaws. As a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) can generate a global disease diagnosis model through multiparty collaboration. However, FL is still unable to resist inference attacks. In this article, to address such problems, we propose a privacy-enhanced disease diagnosis mechanism using FL for IoMT. Specifically, we first reconstruct medical data through a variational autoencoder and add differential privacy noise to it to resist inference attacks. These data are then used to train local disease diagnosis models, thereby preserving patients' privacy. Furthermore, to encourage participation in FL, we propose an incentive mechanism to provide corresponding rewards to participants. Experiments are conducted on the arrhythmia database Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH). The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism reduces the probability of reconstructing patient medical data while ensuring high-precision heart disease diagnosis."

However, due to the highly sensitive nature of medical data, data fusion has always been problematic. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention as it allows for model training without exposing raw data. Nevertheless, existing research demonstrates that FL still brings the risk of privacy breaches. Furthermore, within the FL framework, a malicious server could potentially provide forged aggregated results, leading to disastrous consequences for the medical system. In this paper, we propose the RFLPV, a robust FL scheme with privacy preservation and verifiable aggregation to enable collaboration among medical institutions and facilitate the fusion of medical data. Specifically, we preserve gradient privacy by adding pairwise masks. Additionally, we design an efficient verification mechanism to tackle the threat posed by a malicious server. Furthermore, we develop a customized local training strategy to accommodate the heterogeneity of medical data. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of RFLPV using a real medical dataset.

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning, QNNs, DP, and HE for energy‑efficient, privacy‑preserving smart healthcare; however, it does not target diabetes, nor apply AI directly to diabetic clinical tasks. Addresses privacy and utility, but lacks explicit clinical decision support or bias analysis.","The privacy-focused concept of Federated Learning (FL) allows local data processing without disclosing patients’ health details to a central server. However, its vulnerability to privacy breaches through shared model weights and susceptibility to a single point of failure remain concerns. Energy constraints of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) necessitate considering computation and transmission energy in the FL process. Thus, this article introduces a smart healthcare system prioritizing energy efficiency and privacy through a blockchain-backed FL model. Yet, WBAN users might be unwilling to share data without adequate incentives, and miners might hesitate due to the high energy usage associated with maintaining the blockchain. Therefore, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize system utility while considering energy, WBAN incentives, miner revenue, and FL loss. A computationally efficient stable matching-based algorithm is proposed for optimizing utility via associating WBANs and miners. Associated WBANs use Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) to minimize computation energy. Moreover, this work integrates Differential Privacy (DP) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) mechanisms to prevent information leakage by adding noise to gradients before updating model weights and encrypting consequences before transmitting them to miners. Real-world experiments validate the framework, yielding an average of 15.1%, 9.03%, and 15.35% improvements over existing methods. "

Previous works on federated learning have been inadequate in ensuring the privacy of DIs and the availability of the final federated model. In this article, we design a secure federated learning mechanism with multiple keys to prevent DI-level poisoning attacks for medical diagnosis, called <sc xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">SFAP</small> .

However, there are challenges to analyzing multicenter EHR data including privacy protection, large-scale computation, heterogeneity across sites, and correlated observations. In this paper, we propose a federated algorithm for generalized linear mixed models (Fed-GLMM), which can flexibly model multicenter longitudinal or correlated data while accounting for site-level heterogeneity. Fed-GLMM can be applied to both federated and centralized research networks to enable privacy-preserving data integration and improve computational efficiency. By communicating only a limited amount of summary statistics, Fed-GLMM can achieve nearly identical results as the gold-standard method where the GLMM is directly fitted on the pooled dataset. We demonstrate the performance of Fed-GLMM in both numerical experiments and an application to longitudinal EHR data from multiple healthcare facilities."

Machine Learning algorithms typically use the risk score of each patient based on risk factors, which could help healthcare providers decide about post‐COVID‐19 care and follow‐up where the data privacy is another severe concern. The authors investigate the applicability of a distributed reinforcement learning approach in a Federated Learning (FL) multi‐disciplinary reinforcement system and explores the potential benefits of incorporating Blockchain Technology (BT) in the distributed system. Intermediate dependency features and transactions are avoided by applying Blockchain‐enabled reinforcement FL for the post‐COVID‐19 patient data of IoMT applications.

The main objective is to improve the efficiency and scalability of the reinforcement FL process in a distributed environment while ensuring data privacy and security through BT for IoMT applications. Results show that proposed approach achieve comparatively high reliability and outperforms the existing approaches."

Reliably evaluating equity-related model failures is a critical step toward developing systems that promote health equity. We present resources and methodologies for surfacing biases with potential to precipitate equity-related harms in long-form, LLM-generated answers to medical questions and conduct a large-scale empirical case study with the Med-PaLM 2 LLM. Our contributions include a multifactorial framework for human assessment of LLM-generated answers for biases and EquityMedQA, a collection of seven datasets enriched for adversarial queries. Both our human assessment framework and our dataset design process are grounded in an iterative participatory approach and review of Med-PaLM 2 answers. Through our empirical study, we find that our approach surfaces biases that may be missed by narrower evaluation approaches. Our experience underscores the importance of using diverse assessment methodologies and involving raters of varying backgrounds and expertise. While our approach is not sufficient to holistically assess whether the deployment of an artificial intelligence (AI) system promotes equitable health outcomes, we hope that it can be leveraged and built upon toward a shared goal of LLMs that promote accessible and equitable healthcare.

- **Reasoning:** Uses fully decentralized federated learning with differential privacy for heart disease prediction; no diabetes data or application, but strong FL and privacy focus.","Heart disease is a leading global cause of death, while federated learning (FL) is an effective way to predict it. Due to patient privacy concerns and the centralized nature of current FL approaches, collaborative research in heart disease prediction (HDP) faces significant hurdles in computational health systems. This article introduces a distributed online aggregation method within fully decentralized federated learning (DFL), named DeFedHDP, to address these privacy challenges and improve the model of HDP. Moreover, the differential privacy (DP) mechanism is applied to the aggregation strategy of DeFedHDP to protect the privacy of the patients. The data holder communicates directly with neighbors in a series of time-varying directed graphs without the involvement of a central server. Furthermore, each participant is both a trainer of the local model and a collaborator of the other participants’ models. The data does not leave the local device, only the model parameters are exchanged and integrated, and this decentralized approach can further improve the level of privacy protection. In addition, to cope with model gradient disappearance and gradient explosion, the one-point bandit feedback (OPBF) strategy is utilized to estimate the true gradient values. Experiments on a public medical dataset show that the effectiveness of DeFedHDP is close to the centralized FedAVG algorithm for client-server architectures in terms of accuracy and speed."

The metaverse for consumer health utilizes technologies such as virtual reality, digital twins, and big data analysis to facilitate intelligent healthcare image analysis, remote medical consultations, and other services, propelling advancements in healthcare systems. The introduction of federated learning ensures the privacy of metaverse users. However, due to data heterogeneity, consumers exhibit distinct data distributions, impacting the quality of healthcare services. Furthermore, malicious users' attacks on the model lead to inadequate diagnoses. All these challenges may overwhelm traditional methods. To resolve these challenges, we propose FedKC, a personalized federated learning algorithm with robustness against model poisoning attacks in the Consumer Health Metaverse. Furthermore, new users joining the metaverse can quickly receive customized medical services through FedKC. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedKC outperforms current algorithms in thwarting harmful attacks and enhancing client personalization capabilities. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses hybrid federated learning to reduce communication in e‑health, but focuses on general medical data, not diabetes; privacy aspects touch trustworthiness, yet no clinical decision or bias analysis.","Electronic healthcare (e-health) allows smart devices and medical institutions to collaboratively collect patients' data, which is trained by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help doctors make diagnosis. By allowing multiple devices to train models collaboratively, federated learning is a promising solution to address the communication and privacy issues in e-health. However, applying federated learning in e-health faces many challenges. First, medical data are both horizontally and vertically partitioned. Since single horizontal federated learning (HFL) or vertical federated learning (VFL) techniques cannot deal with both types of data partitioning, directly applying them may consume excessive communication cost due to transmitting a part of raw data when requiring high modeling accuracy. Second, a naive combination of HFL and VFL has limitations including low training efficiency, unsound convergence analysis, and lack of parameter tuning strategies. In this article, we provide a thorough study on an effective integration of HFL and VFL, to achieve communication efficiency and overcome the above limitations when data are both horizontally and vertically partitioned. Specifically, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework with one intermediate result exchange and two aggregation phases. Based on this framework, we develop a hybrid stochastic gradient descent (HSGD) algorithm to train models. Then, we theoretically analyze the convergence upper bound of the proposed algorithm. Using the convergence results, we design adaptive strategies to adjust the training parameters and shrink the size of transmitted data. The experimental results validate that the proposed HSGD algorithm can achieve the desired accuracy while reducing communication cost, and they also verify the effectiveness of the adaptive strategies."

Transfer learning approaches to (3) domain generalization are summarized, as are recent advances and the wealth of domain adaptation benchmark datasets available. Recent breakthroughs surveyed in (4) task generalization include few-shot meta-learning approaches and the BERT NLP engine, and recent (5) modality generalization studies are discussed that integrate image and text data and that apply a biologically-inspired network across olfactory, visual, and auditory modalities.

This has attracted a great deal of attention from academia to industry in recent years. This has undoubtedly improved the quality of healthcare delivery. However, these AI-based medical applications still have poor adoption due to their difficulties in satisfying strict security, privacy, and quality of service standards (such as low latency). Moreover, medical data are usually fragmented and private, making it challenging to generate robust results across populations. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it possible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner. Thus, FL has become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical data at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and security concerns. To this end, this survey paper highlights the current and future of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a significant burden. It also review and discuss the current research trends and their outcomes for designing reliable and scalable FL models. We outline the general FL's statistical problems, device challenges, security, privacy concerns, and its potential in the medical domain. Moreover, our study is also focused on medical applications where we highlight the burden of global cancer and the efficient use of FL for the development of computer-aided diagnosis tools for addressing them.

More training data provides greater statistical power to generate better models that can help decision-making in healthcare. However, this often requires combining research and patient data across institutions and hospitals, which is not always possible due to privacy considerations. In this paper, we outline a simple federated learning algorithm implementing differential privacy to ensure privacy when training a machine learning model on data spread across different institutions. We tested our model by predicting breast cancer status from gene expression data. Our model achieves a similar level of accuracy and precision as a single-site non-private neural network model when we enforce privacy.

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning to enable privacy‑preserving collaborative model training, but focuses on general healthcare without diabetes-specific application or data.","Generalizability, external validity, and reproducibility are high priorities for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. Traditional approaches to addressing these elements involve sharing patient data between institutions or practice settings, which can compromise data privacy (individuals’ right to prevent the sharing and disclosure of information about themselves) and data security (simultaneously preserving confidentiality, accuracy, fidelity, and availability of data). This article describes insights from real-world implementation of federated learning techniques that offer opportunities to maintain both data privacy and availability via collaborative machine learning that shares knowledge, not data. Local models are trained separately on local data. As they train, they send local model updates (e.g. coefficients or gradients) for consolidation into a global model. In some use cases, global models outperform local models on new, previously unseen local datasets, suggesting that collaborative learning from a greater number of examples, including a greater number of rare cases, may improve predictive performance. Even when sharing model updates rather than data, privacy leakage can occur when adversaries perform property or membership inference attacks which can be used to ascertain information about the training set. Emerging techniques mitigate risk from adversarial attacks, allowing investigators to maintain both data privacy and availability in collaborative healthcare research. When data heterogeneity between participating centers is high, personalized algorithms may offer greater generalizability by improving performance on data from centers with proportionately smaller training sample sizes. Properly applied, federated learning has the potential to optimize the reproducibility and performance of collaborative learning while preserving data security and privacy."

Combined with developments in data science, these massive data provide the potential to better understand the genetic underpinnings of brain diseases. However, different datasets, which are stored at different institutions, cannot always be shared directly due to privacy and legal concerns, thus limiting the full exploitation of big data in the study of brain disorders. Here we propose a federated learning framework for securely accessing and meta-analyzing any biomedical data without sharing individual information. We illustrate our framework by investigating brain structural relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts. The framework is first tested on synthetic data and then applied to multi-centric, multi-database studies including ADNI, PPMI, MIRIAD and UK Biobank, showing the potential of the approach for further applications in distributed analysis of multi-centric cohorts"

- **Reasoning:** Uses vertical asynchronous federated learning to train models on heterogeneous data; applies to generic image and healthcare datasets, not diabetes, and focuses on privacy rather than clinical decision support.","Horizontal Federated learning (FL) handles multi-client data that share the same set of features, and vertical FL trains a better predictor that combine all the features from different clients. This paper targets solving vertical FL in an asynchronous fashion, and develops a simple FL method. The new method allows each client to run stochastic gradient algorithms without coordination with other clients, so it is suitable for intermittent connectivity of clients. This method further uses a new technique of perturbed local embedding to ensure data privacy and improve communication efficiency. Theoretically, we present the convergence rate and privacy level of our method for strongly convex, nonconvex and even nonsmooth objectives separately. Empirically, we apply our method to FL on various image and healthcare datasets. The results compare favorably to centralized and synchronous FL methods."

- **Reasoning:** Uses ML and bias mitigation for AD MRI diagnosis; no diabetes focus; fairness analysis aligns with trustworthiness but clinical relevance is disease‑specific; lacks multimodal, federated, or transfer learning components.","The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%, respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics, influence model fairness."

Existing methods rely heavily on manual annotation or training-intensive deep learning models that lack generalizability. Here we report RADAR. This is an annotation-free computational framework for the 3D segmentation and quantification of optical coherence tomography angiography data. The pipeline integrates adaptive physics-aware denoising with topology-preserving centerline extraction to reconstruct complex networks without manual labeling. We validated the framework in healthy individuals and patients with early-stage diabetic retinopathy. The method outperformed standard segmentation tools and resolved layer-specific morphological alterations obscured in conventional two-dimensional projections. Quantitative analysis revealed distinct patterns of compensatory remodeling and increased tortuosity in diabetic eyes. RADAR enables precise extraction of volumetric biomarkers including vessel length and branching complexity.

- **Reasoning:** Uses decentralized federated learning with ring‑Allreduce for privacy‑preserving training; focuses on general digital healthcare, not diabetes, and lacks direct clinical decision or multimodal components.","Federated learning of deep neural networks has emerged as an evolving paradigm for distributed machine learning, gaining widespread attention due to its ability to update parameters without collecting raw data from users, especially in digital healthcare applications. However, the traditional centralized architecture of federated learning suffers from several problems (e.g., single point of failure, communication bottlenecks, etc.), especially malicious servers inferring gradients and causing gradient leakage. To tackle the above issues, we propose a robust and privacy-preserving decentralized deep federated learning (RPDFL) training scheme. Specifically, we design a novel ring FL structure and a Ring-Allreduce-based data sharing scheme to improve the communication efficiency in RPDFL training. Furthermore, we improve the process of distributing parameters of the Chinese residual theorem to update the execution process of the threshold secret sharing, supporting healthcare edge to drop out during the training process without causing data leakage, and ensuring the robustness of the RPDFL training under the Ring-Allreduce-based data sharing scheme. Security analysis indicates that RPDFL is provable secure. Experiment results show that RPDFL is significantly superior to standard FL methods in terms of model accuracy and convergence, and is suitable for digital healthcare applications."

- **Reasoning:** Uses DP‑SGD to train deep models on medical images, demonstrating privacy‑preserving performance; however, it does not involve diabetes data or related clinical decision support beyond general privacy considerations.","The successful training of deep learning models for diagnostic deployment in medical imaging applications requires large volumes of data. Such data cannot be procured without consideration for patient privacy, mandated both by legal regulations and ethical requirements of the medical profession. Differential privacy (DP) enables the provision of information-theoretic privacy guarantees to patients and can be implemented in the setting of deep neural network training through the differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm. We here present deepee, a free-and-open-source framework for differentially private deep learning for use with the PyTorch deep learning framework. Our framework is based on parallelised execution of neural network operations to obtain and modify the per-sample gradients. The process is efficiently abstracted via a data structure maintaining shared memory references to neural network weights to maintain memory efficiency. We furthermore offer specialised data loading procedures and privacy budget accounting based on the Gaussian Differential Privacy framework, as well as automated modification of the user-supplied neural network architectures to ensure DP-conformity of its layers. We benchmark our framework's computational performance against other open-source DP frameworks and evaluate its application on the paediatric pneumonia dataset, an image classification task and on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Liver dataset in the task of medical image segmentation. We find that neural network training with rigorous privacy guarantees is possible while maintaining acceptable classification performance and excellent segmentation performance. Our framework compares favourably to related work with respect to memory consumption and computational performance. Our work presents an open-source software framework for differentially private deep learning, which we demonstrate in medical imaging analysis tasks. It serves to further the utilisation of privacy-enhancing techniques in medicine and beyond in order to assist researchers and practitioners in addressing the numerous outstanding challenges towards their widespread implementation."

- **Reasoning:** Uses a novel fairness feedback model and learning algorithm for kidney allocation; applies ML but unrelated to diabetes, yet includes bias/fairness analysis and some trustworthiness considerations.","Modern kidney placement incorporates several intelligent recommendation systems which exhibit social discrimination due to biases inherited from training data. Although initial attempts were made in the literature to study algorithmic fairness in kidney placement, these methods replace true outcomes with surgeons' decisions due to the long delays involved in recording such outcomes reliably. However, the replacement of true outcomes with surgeons' decisions disregards expert stakeholders' biases as well as social opinions of other stakeholders who do not possess medical expertise. This paper alleviates the latter concern and designs a novel fairness feedback survey to evaluate an acceptance rate predictor (ARP) that predicts a kidney's acceptance rate in a given kidney-match pair. The survey is launched on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform, and public opinions are collected from 85 anonymous crowd participants. A novel social fairness preference learning algorithm is proposed based on minimizing social feedback regret computed using a novel logit-based fairness feedback model. The proposed model and learning algorithm are both validated using simulation experiments as well as Prolific data. Public preferences towards group fairness notions in the context of kidney placement have been estimated and discussed in detail. The specific ARP tested in the Prolific survey has been deemed fair by the participants."

Although deep learning algorithms excel in challenging scenarios, their widespread adoption presents a challenge due to their need for more transparency. The advent of Explainable AI (XAI) has addressed this limitation by offering AI-driven systems with attributes such as transparency, interpretability, and reliability. The need for transparency in critical sectors like healthcare has prompted an increased academic focus on investigating and understanding these frameworks. The present paper thoroughly examines the latest research and advancements in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically focusing on its integration into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in healthcare settings. The last section tackles outstanding issues concerning XAI and IoMT and outlines prospective directions for further research. A thorough investigation was carried out across many scholarly databases and online digital libraries, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Wiley Interscience, Taylor and Francis, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer, Google Scholar, Citeseer Library, Semantic Scholar, and other relevant sources. An analysis was conducted on articles published from March 2004 to February 2024, specifically focusing on AI models that explain different healthcare issues. The search query included ""Explainable AI"" in conjunction with ""Open Black Box, Healthcare, Transparent Models, Interpretable Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Medical Information System, Accountability, Smart Healthcare, and Responsible AI"", indicating the field's dynamic nature. The authors also examined various techniques and datasets to elucidate healthcare difficulties, including incorporating the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The evaluation included more than 105 published models that used clinical data input to diagnose diverse disorders, focusing on incorporating Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) components. In addition to illness diagnosis, these models also elucidate the decisions made. The models were classified according to the input data, used methodologies, and integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The categorization included machine learning and deep learning methodologies, particularly on explainability models connected to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These models were classified as model-agnostic, model-specific, global, local, ante-hoc, and post-hoc. This extensive study examines machine learning, and deep learning models developed based on clinical data and associated with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for illness detection. These models improve efficiency and accuracy and provide essential assistance to medical personnel. Explaining each choice made by individuals contributes to the acceleration of sickness detection, resulting in decreased medical expenses for patients and healthcare systems. The integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) highlights a fundamental change in healthcare towards more transparent and linked systems, leading to significant breakthroughs in medical decision-making.

Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data. Studies also explore improvements to the aggregation mechanisms required to generate the learning model from distributed contributions and case studies with different types of medical data."

- **Reasoning:** Uses decaying Gaussian noise for DP training, advancing privacy‑preserving DL. Focuses on chest X‑ray classification, not diabetic data. No direct diabetes application, but addresses trustworthiness via privacy. Imaging relevance limited to non‑diabetic radiographs.","Deep learning holds a great promise of revolutionizing healthcare and medicine. Unfortunately, various inference attack models demonstrated that deep learning puts sensitive patient information at risk. The high capacity of deep neural networks is the main reason behind the privacy loss. In particular, patient information in the training data can be unintentionally memorized by a deep network. Adversarial parties can extract that information given the ability to access or query the network. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving mechanism for training deep neural networks. Our approach adds decaying Gaussian noise to the gradients at every training iteration. This is in contrast to the mainstream approach adopted by Google’s TensorFlow Privacy, which employs the same noise scale in each step of the whole training process. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach provides an explicit closed-form mathematical expression to approximately estimate the privacy loss. It is easy to compute and can be useful when the users would like to decide proper training time, noise scale, and sampling ratio during the planning phase. We provide extensive experimental results using one real-world medical dataset (chest radiographs from the CheXpert dataset) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed differential privacy based deep learning model achieves significantly higher classification accuracy over the existing methods with the same privacy budget."

In the medical field, any judgment or decision is fraught with risk. A doctor will carefully judge whether a patient is sick before forming a reasonable explanation based on the patient’s symptoms and/or an examination. Therefore, to be a viable and accepted tool, AI needs to mimic human judgment and interpretation skills. Specifically, explainable AI (XAI) aims to explain the information behind the black-box model of deep learning that reveals how the decisions are made. This paper provides a survey of the most recent XAI techniques used in healthcare and related medical imaging applications. We summarize and categorize the XAI types, and highlight the algorithms used to increase interpretability in medical imaging topics. In addition, we focus on the challenging XAI problems in medical applications and provide guidelines to develop better interpretations of deep learning models using XAI concepts in medical image and text analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides future directions to guide developers and researchers for future prospective investigations on clinical topics, particularly on applications with medical imaging."

With the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the importance for plausibility and verifiability of the predictions made by machine learning models has become essential. To tackle this challenge, recently, several machine learning interpretability techniques have been developed and introduced. In general, the main aim of these interpretability techniques is to shed light and provide insights into the predictions process of the machine learning models and explain how the model predictions have resulted. However, in practice, assessing the quality of the explanations provided by the various interpretability techniques is still questionable. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of three recent and popular local model agnostic interpretability techniques, namely, LIME, SHAP and Anchors on different types of real-world healthcare data. Our experimental evaluation covers different aspects for its comparison including identity, stability, separability, similarity, execution time and bias detection. The results of our experiments show that LIME achieves the lowest performance for the identity metric and the highest performance for the separability metric across all datasets included in this study. On average, SHAP has the smallest average time to output explanation across all datasets included in this study. For detecting the bias, SHAP enables the participants to better detect the bias."

However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques."

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry."

MASLD is highly comorbid with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, posing a serious threat to public health and creating a significant medical and socioeconomic burden. Despite advances in research, current clinical practice still faces considerable challenges in early screening, risk stratification, prognostic prediction, and long-term therapeutic monitoring. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have provided transformative opportunities to address these challenges. AI has demonstrated unique advantages in imaging interpretation, multiomics integration, electronic health record analysis, and remote health management, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of the noninvasive diagnosis, individualized risk stratification, precision therapy, and dynamic disease monitoring of MASLD. In this mini-review, the latest advances in AI applications for MASLD diagnosis and management are systematically summarized, and a forward-looking perspective on the role of AI in enabling the next generation of smart health care systems for MASLD is offered, with the aim of providing theoretical and practical guidance for the clinical management of this disease."

However, digital and health-care data repositories that are used to train AI algorithms can introduce bias when data are homogeneous and health-care processes are inequitable. AI bias can also be introduced during algorithm development, testing, implementation, and post-implementation processes. The consequences of AI algorithmic bias can be considerable, including missed diagnoses, misclassification of disease, incorrect risk prediction, and inappropriate treatment recommendations. This bias can disproportionately affect marginalised demographic groups. In this Series paper, we provide a brief overview of AI applications in cardiovascular health care, discuss stages of algorithm development and associated sources of bias, and provide examples of harm from biased algorithms. We propose strategies that can be applied during the training, testing, and implementation of AI algorithms to mitigate bias so that all those at risk for or living with cardiovascular disease might benefit equally from AI.

These models have the potential to benefit both patients and health care providers but can also exacerbate health inequities. Existing ""algorithmic fairness"" methods for measuring and correcting model bias fall short of what is needed for health policy in two key ways. First, methods typically focus on a single grouping along which discrimination may occur rather than considering multiple, intersecting groups. Second, in clinical applications, risk prediction is typically used to guide treatment, creating distinct statistical issues that invalidate most existing techniques. We present novel unfairness metrics that address both challenges. We also develop a complete framework of estimation and inference tools for our metrics, including the unfairness value (""u-value""), used to determine the relative extremity of unfairness, and standard errors and confidence intervals employing an alternative to the standard bootstrap. We demonstrate application of our framework to a COVID-19 risk prediction model deployed in a major Midwestern health system. "

It is challenging to recognize the source of bias in AI-model due to variations in datasets and black box nature of system design. Additionally, there is no distinct process to identify the potential source of bias in the AI-model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of its kind that addresses the bias in AI-model by categorizing 48 studies into three classes, namely, point-based, image-based, and hybrid-based AI-models. Selection strategy using PRISMA is adopted to select the 72 crucial AI studies for identifying bias in AI models. Using the three classes, bias is identified in these studies based on 44 critical AI attributes. Bias in the AI-models is computed by analytical, butterfly, and ranking-based bias models. These bias models were evaluated using two experts and compared using variability analysis. AI-studies that lacked sufficient AI-attributes are more prone to risk-of-bias (RoB) in all three classes. Studies with high RoB loses fins in the butterfly model. It has been analyzed that the majority of the studies in healthcare suffer from data bias and algorithmic bias due to incomplete specifications mentioned in the design protocol and weak AI design exploited for prediction.

Thus, constructing a privacy preserving machine learning model while still maintaining high accuracy becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose two differentially private algorithms, i.e., Output Perturbation with aGM (OPERA) and Gradient Perturbation with aGM (GRPUA) for empirical risk minimization, a useful method to obtain a globally optimal classifier, by leveraging the analytic Gaussian mechanism (aGM) to achieve privacy preservation of sensitive medical data in a healthcare system. We theoretically analyze and prove utility upper bounds of proposed algorithms and compare them with prior algorithms in the literature. The analyses show that in the high privacy regime, our proposed algorithms can achieve a tighter utility bound for both settings: strongly convex and non-strongly convex loss functions. Besides, we evaluate the proposed private algorithms on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Adult, BANK and IPUMS-BR. The simulation results demonstrate that our approaches can achieve higher accuracy and lower objective values compared with existing ones in all three datasets while providing differential privacy guarantees."

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated VAE to cut communication and handle non‑IID data, but focuses on general remote patient monitoring, not diabetes, and lacks direct clinical decision or diabetes‑specific evaluation.","Federated learning (FL), collaboratively training a shared global model without exchanging and centralizing local data, provides a promising solution for privacy preserving. On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931). Besides, fine-tuning the global model with personalization can raise the average AUC to 0.9947. Moreover, compared with vanilla FL, FedVAE shows 0.87% improvement in AUC while reducing communication traffic by at least 95%. "

No diabetes focus, no multimodal or federated methods, and no imaging or transfer learning.","Healthcare continues to grapple with the persistent issue of treatment disparities, sparking concerns regarding the equitable allocation of treatments in clinical practice. While various fairness metrics have emerged to assess fairness in decision-making processes, a growing focus has been on causality-based fairness concepts due to their capacity to mitigate confounding effects and reason about bias. However, the application of causal fairness notions in evaluating the fairness of clinical decision-making with electronic health record (EHR) data remains an understudied domain. This study aims to address the methodological gap in assessing causal fairness of treatment allocation with electronic health records data. In addition, we investigate the impact of social determinants of health on the assessment of causal fairness of treatment allocation. We propose a causal fairness algorithm to assess fairness in clinical decision-making. Our algorithm accounts for the heterogeneity of patient populations and identifies potential unfairness in treatment allocation by conditioning on patients who have the same likelihood to benefit from the treatment. We apply this framework to a patient cohort with coronary artery disease derived from an EHR database to evaluate the fairness of treatment decisions. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) allocation among different patient groups. Women were found to be 4.4%–7.7% less likely to receive CABG than men in two out of four treatment response strata. Similarly, Black or African American patients were 5.4%–8.7% less likely to receive CABG than others in three out of four response strata. These results were similar when social determinants of health (insurance and area deprivation index) were dropped from the algorithm. These findings highlight the presence of disparities in treatment allocation among similar patients, suggesting potential unfairness in the clinical decision-making process. This study introduces a novel approach for assessing the fairness of treatment allocation in healthcare. By incorporating responses to treatment into fairness framework, our method explores the potential of quantifying fairness from a causal perspective using EHR data. Our research advances the methodological development of fairness assessment in healthcare and highlight the importance of causality in determining treatment fairness. "

The ML and DL techniques following a data-centralized approach have difficulties in handling the scattered data frequently associated with DSA. Federated Learning (FL) acknowledges the scattered data and provides a more secure and efficient way to analyze such data. This motivates previously reluctant entities like banks to collaborate for variety and quantity of data. Most DSA transitioned to FL, but the migration is not without concerns. These include communication costs, heterogeneity, and malicious attacks. In this paper, we deeply analyze the role of FL in DSA and provide a taxonomy for the studies and implementations of FL. Then we provide an insight into DSA covering works in healthcare and finance. A glance is provided at attempts in non-DSA with possible DSA applications. Finally, we discuss FL's open issues and challenges with their possible solutions. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses a hybrid deep‑learning network for IoT sensor signal analysis in healthcare, but focuses on general e‑health applications, not diabetes; mentions decision support without diabetes‑specific validation.","IoT is a fascinating technology in today's IT world, in which items may transmit data and interact through intranet or internet networks. TheInternet of Things (IoT) has shown a lot of promise in connecting various medical equipment, sensors, and healthcare specialists to provide high-quality medical services from afar. As a result, patient safety has improved, healthcare expenses have fallen, healthcare service accessibility has increased, and operational efficiency has increased in the healthcare industry. Healthcare IoT signal analysis is now widely employed in clinics as a critical diagnostic tool for diagnosing health issues. In the medical domain, automated identification and classification technologies help clinicians make more accurate and timely diagnoses. In this paper, we have proposed a Deep Learning-Based hybrid network architecture (CNN-R-LSTM (DCRL)) that combines the characteristics of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based long-short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose IoT sensor signals and classify them into three categories: healthy, patient, and serious illness. Deep CNN-R-LSTM Algorithm is used for classify the IoT healthcare data support via a dedicated neural networking model. For our study, we have used the MIT-BIH dataset, the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, the BP dataset, and the Cleveland Cardiology datasets. The experimental results revealed great classification performance in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, with 99.02 percent, 99.47 percent, and 99.56 percent, respectively. Our proposed DCLR model is based on healthcare IoT Centre inputs enhanced with the centenary, which may aid clinicians in effectively recognizing the health condition."

- **Reasoning:** Uses explainable AI methods for healthcare predictive analytics, emphasizing trust and decision support, but does not focus on diabetes or related multimodal, federated, imaging, or bias analyses.","\n With rapid developments in big data technology and the prevalence of large-scale datasets from diverse sources, the healthcare predictive analytics (HPA) field is witnessing a dramatic surge in interest. In healthcare, it is not only important to provide accurate predictions, but also critical to provide reliable explanations to the underlying black-box models making the predictions. Such explanations can play a crucial role in not only supporting clinical decision-making but also facilitating user engagement and patient safety. If users and decision makers do not have faith in the HPA model, it is highly likely that they will reject its use. Furthermore, it is extremely risky to blindly accept and apply the results derived from black-box models, which might lead to undesirable consequences or life-threatening outcomes in domains with high stakes such as healthcare. As machine learning and artificial intelligence systems are becoming more capable and ubiquitous, explainable artificial intelligence and machine learning interpretability are garnering significant attention among practitioners and researchers. The introduction of policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has amplified the need for ensuring human interpretability of prediction models. In this talk I will discuss methods and applications for developing local as well as global explanations from machine learning and the value they can provide for healthcare prediction."

Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

However, the inherent opacity of deep neural networks (DNNs) poses challenges to their acceptance and trust in clinical settings. This survey paper delves into the landscape of explainable deep learning techniques within the healthcare domain, offering a thorough examination of deep learning explainability techniques. Recognizing the pressing need for nuanced interpretability, we extend our focus to include the integration of fuzzy logic as a novel and vital category. The survey begins by categorizing and critically analyzing existing intrinsic, visualization, and distillation techniques, shedding light on their strengths and limitations in healthcare applications. Building upon this foundation, we introduce fuzzy logic as a distinct category, emphasizing its capacity to address uncertainties inherent in medical data, thus contributing to the interpretability of DNNs. Fuzzy logic, traditionally applied in decision-making contexts, offers a unique perspective on unraveling the black box of DNNs, providing a structured framework for capturing and explaining complex decision processes. Through a comprehensive exploration of techniques, we showcase the effectiveness of fuzzy logic as an additional layer of interpretability, complementing intrinsic, visualization, and distillation methods. Our survey contributes to a holistic understanding of explainable deep learning in healthcare, facilitating the seamless integration of DNNs into clinical workflows. By combining traditional methods with the novel inclusion of fuzzy logic, we aim to provide a nuanced and comprehensive view of interpretability techniques, advancing the transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning models in the healthcare landscape."

Such methods can be broadly categorized into two main types: post hoc explanations and inherently interpretable algorithms. We aimed at analyzing the possible associations between COVID-19 and the push of explainable AI (XAI) to the forefront of biomedical research. We automatically extracted from the PubMed database biomedical XAI studies related to concepts of causality or explainability and manually labeled 1,603 papers with respect to XAI categories. To compare the trends pre- and post-COVID-19, we fit a change point detection model and evaluated significant changes in publication rates. We show that the advent of COVID-19 in the beginning of 2020 could be the driving factor behind an increased focus concerning XAI, playing a crucial role in accelerating an already evolving trend. Finally, we present a discussion with future societal use and impact of XAI technologies and potential future directions for those who pursue fostering clinical trust with interpretable machine learning models.

- **Reasoning:** Uses CNN, XGBoost, SHAP for lung cancer detection with explainability; no diabetes focus, so fails domain-specific criteria but offers clinical interpretability.","Artificial intelligence (AI) has several uses in the healthcare industry, some of which include healthcare management, medical forecasting, practical making of decisions, and diagnosis. AI technologies have reached human-like performance, but their use is limited since they are still largely viewed as opaque black boxes. This distrust remains the primary factor for their limited real application, particularly in healthcare. As a result, there is a need for interpretable predictors that provide better predictions and also explain their predictions.This study introduces ""DeepXplainer"", a new interpretable hybrid deep learning-based technique for detecting lung cancer and providing explanations of the predictions. This technique is based on a convolutional neural network and XGBoost. XGBoost is used for class label prediction after ""DeepXplainer"" has automatically learned the features of the input using its many convolutional layers. For providing explanations or explainability of the predictions, an explainable artificial intelligence method known as ""SHAP"" is implemented.The open-source ""Survey Lung Cancer"" dataset was processed using this method. On multiple parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, etc., the proposed method outperformed the existing methods. The proposed method obtained an accuracy of 97.43%, a sensitivity of 98.71%, and an F1-score of 98.08. After the model has made predictions with this high degree of accuracy, each prediction is explained by implementing an explainable artificial intelligence method at both the local and global levels.A deep learning-based classification model for lung cancer is proposed with three primary components: one for feature learning, another for classification, and a third for providing explanations for the predictions made by the proposed hybrid (ConvXGB) model. The proposed ""DeepXplainer"" has been evaluated using a variety of metrics, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the current benchmarks. Providing explanations for the predictions, the proposed approach may help doctors in detecting and treating lung cancer patients more effectively. "

Split Learning (SL) allows a model to be trained in a split manner across different locations. Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is a more recent approach that combines the strengths of FL and SL. SplitFed minimizes the computational burden of FL by balancing computation across clients and servers, while still preserving data privacy. This makes it an ideal learning framework across various domains, especially in healthcare, where data privacy is of utmost importance. However, SplitFed networks encounter numerous communication challenges, such as latency, bandwidth constraints, synchronization overhead, and a large amount of data that needs to be transferred during the learning process. In this paper, we propose SplitFedZip -- a novel method that employs learned compression to reduce data transfer in SplitFed learning. Through experiments on medical image segmentation, we show that learned compression can provide a significant data communication reduction in SplitFed learning, while maintaining the accuracy of the final trained model.

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning with conformal prediction for medical imaging; no diabetes data or application, but addresses calibration and privacy, offering limited clinical trust aspects.","Federated learning has attracted considerable interest for collaborative machine learning in healthcare to leverage separate institutional datasets while maintaining patient privacy. However, additional challenges such as poor calibration and lack of interpretability may also hamper widespread deployment of federated models into clinical practice, leading to user distrust or misuse of ML tools in high-stakes clinical decision-making. In this paper, we propose to address these challenges by incorporating an adaptive conformal framework into federated learning to ensure distribution-free prediction sets that provide coverage guarantees. Importantly, these uncertainty estimates can be obtained without requiring any additional modifications to the model. Empirical results on the MedMNIST medical imaging benchmark demonstrate our federated method provides tighter coverage over local conformal predictions on 6 different medical imaging datasets for 2D and 3D multi-class classification tasks. Furthermore, we correlate class entropy with prediction set size to assess task uncertainty."

Three barriers currently constrain reliable interpretation of glucose-derived measures. The first is limited transparency: in several regulatory settings, particularly those using Conformité Européenne marking, clinical-study reports, reference-method information and analytical documentation required for market authorisation are not publicly accessible. The second barrier is heterogeneity in study procedures. Existing evaluations use different reference-glucose methods, sampling strategies, glucose-manipulation protocols and participant characteristics, leading to accuracy estimates that cannot be interpreted consistently across systems. The third barrier is calibration alignment. Even with full transparency and aligned procedures, CGM systems may differ because their calibration algorithms are trained on distinct reference-glucose datasets, influencing reported glucose ranges, automated insulin-delivery behaviour and interpretation during device transitions. A modified Delphi process involving clinicians, laboratory scientists, and researchers identified these issues as the principal determinants of comparability. During this process, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine released a validated framework for performance evaluation of CGM systems, providing a unified approach to reference-method selection, dynamic in-clinic testing, and structured reporting. Adoption would reduce procedural variability but does not resolve calibration-alignment differences. This international clinical opinion proposes a pathway towards internationally interpretable CGM evaluation: immediate transparency of clinical evidence, routine declaration of calibration alignment, and progressive adoption of validated standardised procedures. These steps provide a foundation for reliable interpretation and globally comparable assessment of CGM technologies."

To overcome this problem, several studies on interpretability have been proposed. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively review the interpretability of deep learning in medical diagnosis based on the current literature, including some common interpretability methods used in the medical domain, various applications with interpretability for disease diagnosis, prevalent evaluation metrics, and several disease datasets. In addition, the challenges of interpretability and future research directions are also discussed here.

This study presents the Clinical Predictive Fusion Network (CPFN). This adaptive ensemble learning framework integrates Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine classifiers through a validation-driven weighted fusion strategy. The model's adaptive weighting enables it to learn the relative reliability of base classifiers across multimodal patient datasets. CPFN was evaluated using 10-fold stratified cross-validation on disease-specific (cardiology, neurology, diabetes, pulmonology, and oncology) and a synthetically fused multi-disease dataset, achieving up to 93.0 ± 0.4% accuracy on individual datasets and 95.5 ± 0.3% on the combined dataset. Other metrics included a recall of 92.0 ± 0.5%, F1-score of 92.5 ± 0.4%, and ROC-AUC ranging from 0.95 to 0.975 (95% CI, bootstrap 1000 resamples).

- **Reasoning:** Uses a unified latent space to integrate heterogeneous medical data for personalized diagnosis and monitoring, but does not focus on diabetes or apply AI directly to diabetic problems.","Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold -- much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions -- such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide -- but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward."

We explore the complementary relationships among prevalent clinical modalities and outline three main fusion schemes for multimodal classification networks: input fusion, intermediate fusion (encompassing single-level fusion, hierarchical fusion, and attention-based fusion), and output fusion. By evaluating the performance of these fusion techniques, we provide insight into the suitability of different network architectures for various multimodal fusion scenarios and application domains. Furthermore, we delve into challenges related to network architecture selection, handling incomplete multimodal data management, and the potential limitations of multimodal fusion.

These conventional methods typically focus only on the intermodality common information, neglecting the intramodality specific information and assuming that the common information is more effective in disease diagnosis. Moreover, they do not adequately address the impact of fuzzy information between different medical imaging modalities on diagnostic results. To this end, we propose a modality fuzzy information separation network for disease classification, which extracts both common and specific information from fuzzy information to construct a comprehensive representation of multimodal medical images. Specifically, we extract modality invariant features as common information by explicitly modeling and maximizing loss constraints on mutual information. For specific information extraction, a constraint on feature space independence between specific and common information is imposed on each modality. Above-mentioned two steps, we concatenate common information and specific information to construct a comprehensive multimodal representation for separating fuzzy information. Finally, we purposely design a decoder network to reconstruct medical images from unimodal specific information and common information to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modality fuzzy information separation network. We conducted a validation of the proposed method's performance in classifying cardiomegaly, pneumothorax, edema, and skin disease. The experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

- **Reasoning:** Uses consensus workshops to propose safety, validation, and monitoring frameworks for AI‑CDS; addresses trust, bias, and explainability but lacks diabetes focus or specific ML methods.","Abstract Background Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare settings has the potential to benefit clinical decision-making. Addressing challenges such as ensuring trustworthiness, mitigating bias, and maintaining safety is paramount. The lack of established methodologies for pre- and post-deployment evaluation of AI tools regarding crucial attributes such as transparency, performance monitoring, and adverse event reporting makes this situation challenging. Objectives This paper aims to make practical suggestions for creating methods, rules, and guidelines to ensure that the development, testing, supervision, and use of AI in clinical decision support (CDS) systems are done well and safely for patients. Materials and Methods In May 2023, the Division of Clinical Informatics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the American Medical Informatics Association co-sponsored a working group on AI in healthcare. In August 2023, there were 4 webinars on AI topics and a 2-day workshop in September 2023 for consensus-building. The event included over 200 industry stakeholders, including clinicians, software developers, academics, ethicists, attorneys, government policy experts, scientists, and patients. The goal was to identify challenges associated with the trusted use of AI-enabled CDS in medical practice. Key issues were identified, and solutions were proposed through qualitative analysis and a 4-month iterative consensus process. Results Our work culminated in several key recommendations: (1) building safe and trustworthy systems; (2) developing validation, verification, and certification processes for AI-CDS systems; (3) providing a means of safety monitoring and reporting at the national level; and (4) ensuring that appropriate documentation and end-user training are provided. Discussion AI-enabled Clinical Decision Support (AI-CDS) systems promise to revolutionize healthcare decision-making, necessitating a comprehensive framework for their development, implementation, and regulation that emphasizes trustworthiness, transparency, and safety. This framework encompasses various aspects including model training, explainability, validation, certification, monitoring, and continuous evaluation, while also addressing challenges such as data privacy, fairness, and the need for regulatory oversight to ensure responsible integration of AI into clinical workflow. Conclusions Achieving responsible AI-CDS systems requires a collective effort from many healthcare stakeholders. This involves implementing robust safety, monitoring, and transparency measures while fostering innovation. Future steps include testing and piloting proposed trust mechanisms, such as safety reporting protocols, and establishing best practice guidelines. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses bias mitigation concepts to guide imaging AI quality; focuses on general radiology, not diabetes, but offers strong bias/fairness discussion and touches on imaging and trust issues.","Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are prone to bias at multiple stages of model development, with potential for exacerbating health disparities. However, bias in imaging AI is a complex topic that encompasses multiple coexisting definitions. Bias may refer to unequal preference to a person or group owing to preexisting attitudes or beliefs, either intentional or unintentional. However, cognitive bias refers to systematic deviation from objective judgment due to reliance on heuristics, and statistical bias refers to differences between true and expected values, commonly manifesting as systematic error in model prediction (ie, a model with output unrepresentative of real-world conditions). Clinical decisions informed by biased models may lead to patient harm due to action on inaccurate AI results or exacerbate health inequities due to differing performance among patient populations. However, while inequitable bias can harm patients in this context, a mindful approach leveraging equitable bias can address underrepresentation of minority groups or rare diseases. Radiologists should also be aware of bias after AI deployment such as automation bias, or a tendency to agree with automated decisions despite contrary evidence. Understanding common sources of imaging AI bias and the consequences of using biased models can guide preventive measures to mitigate its impact. Accordingly, the authors focus on sources of bias at stages along the imaging machine learning life cycle, attempting to simplify potentially intimidating technical terminology for general radiologists using AI tools in practice or collaborating with data scientists and engineers for AI tool development. The authors review definitions of bias in AI, describe common sources of bias, and present recommendations to guide quality control measures to mitigate the impact of bias in imaging AI.

The traditional MMIF methods are difficult to provide satisfactory fusion accuracy and robustness due to the influence of such possible human-crafted components as image transform and fusion strategies. Existing deep learning based fusion methods are generally difficult to ensure image fusion effect due to the adoption of a human-designed network structure and a relatively simple loss function and the ignorance of human visual characteristics during weight learning. To address these issues, we have presented the foveated differentiable architecture search (F-DARTS) based unsupervised MMIF method. In this method, the foveation operator is introduced into the weight learning process to fully explore human visual characteristics for the effective image fusion. Meanwhile, a distinctive unsupervised loss function is designed for network training by integrating mutual information, sum of the correlations of differences, structural similarity and edge preservation value. Based on the presented foveation operator and loss function, an end-to-end encoder-decoder network architecture will be searched using the F-DARTS to produce the fused image. Experimental results on three multimodal medical image datasets demonstrate that the F-DARTS performs better than several traditional and deep learning based fusion methods by providing visually superior fused results and better objective evaluation metrics."

In medical image segmentation field, most existing UDA methods depend on adversarial learning to address the domain gap between different image modalities, which is ineffective due to its complicated training process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective UDA method based on frequency and spatial domain transfer uner multi-teacher distillation framework. In the frequency domain, we first introduce non-subsampled contourlet transform for identifying domain-invariant and domain-variant frequency components (DIFs and DVFs), and then keep the DIFs unchanged while replacing the DVFs of the source domain images with that of the target domain images to narrow the domain gap. In the spatial domain, we propose a batch momentum update-based histogram matching strategy to reduce the domain-variant image style bias. Experiments on two cross-modality medical image segmentation datasets (cardiac, abdominal) show that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. "

For an effective reuse of existing labeled color fundus photo (CFP) data, we propose Cross-domain Collaborative Learning (CdCL). Inspired by the success of fixed-ratio based mixup in unsupervised domain adaptation, we re-purpose this strategy for the current task. Due to the intrinsic disparity between the field-of-view of CFP and WF/UWF images, a scale bias naturally exists in a mixup sample that the anatomic structure from a CFP image will be considerably larger than its WF/UWF counterpart. The CdCL method resolves the issue by Scale-bias Correction, which employs Transformers for producing scale-invariant features. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on multiple datasets covering both WF and UWF images, the proposed method compares favorably against a number of competitive baselines. "

No diabetes focus, clinical decision aspects, multimodal or federated methods, or bias analysis.","The deep learning-based analysis of medical images suffers from data scarcity because of high annotation costs and privacy concerns. Researchers in this domain have used transfer learning to avoid overfitting when using complex architectures. However, the domain differences between pre-training and downstream data hamper the performance of the downstream task. Some recent studies have successfully used domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) to address this issue. In DAPT, models are initialized with the generic dataset pre-trained weights, and further pre-training is performed using a moderately sized in-domain dataset (medical images). Although this technique achieved good results for the downstream tasks in terms of accuracy and robustness, it is computationally expensive even when the datasets for DAPT are moderately sized. These compute-intensive techniques and models impact the environment negatively and create an uneven playing field for researchers with limited resources. This study proposed computationally efficient DAPT without compromising the downstream accuracy and robustness. This study proposes three techniques for this purpose, where the first (partial DAPT) performs DAPT on a subset of layers. The second one adopts a hybrid strategy (hybrid DAPT) by performing partial DAPT for a few epochs and then full DAPT for the remaining epochs. The third technique performs DAPT on simplified variants of the base architecture. The results showed that compared to the standard DAPT (full DAPT), the hybrid DAPT technique achieved better performance on the development and external datasets. In contrast, simplified architectures (after DAPT) achieved the best robustness while achieving modest performance on the development dataset . "

One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system's detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict future behaviour, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT. "

No diabetes focus, clinical decision, federated learning, bias analysis, or transfer learning.","Medical image fusion aims to derive complementary information from medical images with different modalities and is becoming increasingly important in clinical applications. The design of fusion strategy plays a key role in achieving high-quality fusion results. Existing methods usually employ handcrafted fusion rules or convolution-based networks to fuse multimodal medical images. However, these fusion strategies are insufficiently fine-grained and cannot capture global information of multimodal images effectively. Moreover, for deep learning-based fusion methods, they always concatenate source images/deep features of different modalities to input into the neural network, easily leading to inadequate information utilization from source images. To address these problems, we propose a transformer-based end-to-end framework for medical image fusion, termed TransFusion. The proposed TransFusion introduces the transformer as the fusion strategy, which utilizes its self-attention mechanism to incorporate the global contextual information of multimodal features and fuse them adequately. Besides, unlike traditional parallel multibranch architectures or shared networks used for multiple inputs, we design branch networks that interact through fusion transformers at multiple scales to utilize the information of different modalities more adequately. A natural advantage of our design is the ability to aggregate global multimodal features through self-attention. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art fusion methods."

In this field, medical image fusion integrates scan results from different devices, supporting healthcare systems to make a more informed diagnosis. This study proposes a DL-based network to fuse multimodal medical images. In our method, the lattice unit (LU) is designed to improve the representation capability of the fusion network. Moreover, to acquire hierarchical features from images, the progressive module (PM) treats the network's shallow and deep layers differently. The shallow layers represent the structure of the source image; the deep layers correspond to details. Different loss functions are utilized for these two kinds of information to retain fused images' salient structures and functional information. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs well on visual quality and objective evaluation, which provides a reliable reference for medical diagnosis. In addition, this method is lightweight and speedy compared to existing algorithms, facilitating further placement in the IoMT's specific devices. "

Particularly in medical machine learning, models not trained from scratch are often finetuned based on ImageNet-pretrained models. We posit that pretraining on data from the domain of the downstream task should almost always be preferred instead. We leverage RadNet-12M, a dataset containing more than 12 million computed tomography (CT) image slices, to explore the efficacy of self-supervised pretraining on medical and natural images. Our experiments cover intra- and cross-domain transfer scenarios, varying data scales, finetuning vs. linear evaluation, and feature space analysis. We observe that intra-domain transfer compares favorably to cross-domain transfer, achieving comparable or improved performance (0.44% - 2.07% performance increase using RadNet pretraining, depending on the experiment) and demonstrate the existence of a domain boundary-related generalization gap and domain-specific learned features.

- **Reasoning:** Uses stakeholder-driven XAI design to improve trust and decision support in kidney transplantation; lacks any diabetes focus or related data modalities.","The rise of complex AI systems in healthcare and other sectors has led to a growing area of research called Explainable AI (XAI) designed to increase transparency. In this area, empirical and qualitative studies focus on improving user trust and task performance by providing system- and prediction-level XAI features. We analyze stakeholder engagement events (interviews and workshops) on the use of AI for kidney transplantation. From this we identify themes which we use to frame a scoping literature review on current XAI features. The stakeholder engagement process, including workshops and interviews, lasted over nine months covering three stakeholder group's workflows, determining where AI could intervene and assessing a mock XAI decision support system. Based on the stakeholder engagement, we identify four major themes relevant to designing XAI systems – 1) use of AI predictions, 2) information included in AI predictions, 3) personalization of AI predictions for individual differences, and 4) customizing AI predictions for specific cases. Using these themes, our scoping literature review finds that providing AI predictions before, during, or after decision-making could be beneficial depending on the complexity of the stakeholder's task. Additionally, expert stakeholders like surgeons prefer minimal to no XAI features, AI prediction, and uncertainty estimates for easy use cases. However, almost all stakeholders prefer to have optional XAI features to review when needed, especially in hard-to-predict cases. The literature also suggests that providing both system- and prediction-level information is necessary to build the user's mental model of the system appropriately. Although XAI features improve users' trust in the system, human-AI team performance is not always enhanced. Overall, stakeholders prefer to have agency over the XAI interface to control the level of information based on their needs and task complexity. We conclude with suggestions for future research, especially on customizing XAI features based on preferences and tasks. "

The fairness of medical AI is of great concern due to its direct relation to human life and health. This review aims to analyze the existing research literature on fairness in medical AI from the perspectives of computer science, medical science, and social science (including law and ethics). The objective of the review is to examine the similarities and differences in the understanding of fairness, explore influencing factors, and investigate potential measures to implement fairness in medical AI across English and Chinese literature. This study employed a scoping review methodology and selected the following databases: Web of Science, MEDLINE, Pubmed, OVID, CNKI, WANFANG Data, etc., for the fairness issues in medical AI through February 2023. The search was conducted using various keywords such as “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “medical,” “algorithm,” “fairness,” “decision-making,” and “bias.” The collected data were charted, synthesized, and subjected to descriptive and thematic analysis. After reviewing 468 English papers and 356 Chinese papers, 53 and 42 were included in the final analysis. Our results show the three different disciplines all show significant differences in the research on the core issues. Data is the foundation that affects medical AI fairness in addition to algorithmic bias and human bias. Legal, ethical, and technological measures all promote the implementation of medical AI fairness. Our review indicates a consensus regarding the importance of data fairness as the foundation for achieving fairness in medical AI across multidisciplinary perspectives. However, there are substantial discrepancies in core aspects such as the concept, influencing factors, and implementation measures of fairness in medical AI. Consequently, future research should facilitate interdisciplinary discussions to bridge the cognitive gaps between different fields and enhance the practical implementation of fairness in medical AI.

- **Reasoning:** Uses transfer learning on CT images for COVID-19 detection; no diabetes focus, no multimodal or federated aspects, limited clinical decision discussion, applies medical imaging but not diabetic.","Annotating medical images for disease detection is often tedious and expensive. Moreover, the available training samples for a given task are generally scarce and imbalanced. These conditions are not conducive for learning effective deep neural models. Hence, it is common to 'transfer' neural networks trained on natural images to the medical image domain. However, this paradigm lacks in performance due to the large domain gap between the natural and medical image data. To address that, we propose a novel concept of Pre-text Representation Transfer (PRT). In contrast to the conventional transfer learning, which fine-tunes a source model after replacing its classification layers, PRT retains the original classification layers and updates the representation layers through an unsupervised pre-text task. The task is performed with (original, not synthetic) medical images, without utilizing any annotations. This enables representation transfer with a large amount of training data. This high-fidelity representation transfer allows us to use the resulting model as a more effective feature extractor. Moreover, we can also subsequently perform the traditional transfer learning with this model. We devise a collaborative representation based classification layer for the case when we leverage the model as a feature extractor. We fuse the output of this layer with the predictions of a model induced with the traditional transfer learning performed over our pre-text transferred model. The utility of our technique for limited and imbalanced data classification problem is demonstrated with an extensive five-fold evaluation for three large-scale models, tested for five different class-imbalance ratios for CT based COVID-19 detection. Our results show a consistent gain over the conventional transfer learning with the proposed method."

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning and incentive mechanisms; no diabetes focus; lacks clinical decision or multimodal aspects; discusses fairness concepts loosely.","Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However, practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore, the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems."

A notable concern is the potential to exacerbate entrenched biases and existing health disparities in society. The area of fairness in machine learning seeks to address these issues of equity; however, appropriate approaches are context-dependent, necessitating domain-specific consideration. We focus on clinical trials, i.e., research studies conducted on humans to evaluate medical treatments. Clinical trials are a relatively under-explored application in machine learning for healthcare, in part due to complex ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements and high costs. Our aim is to provide a multi-disciplinary assessment of how fairness for machine learning fits into the context of clinical trials research and practice. We start by reviewing the current ethical considerations and guidelines for clinical trials and examine their relationship with common definitions of fairness in machine learning. We examine potential sources of unfairness in clinical trials, providing concrete examples, and discuss the role machine learning might play in either mitigating potential biases or exacerbating them when applied without care. Particular focus is given to adaptive clinical trials, which may employ machine learning. Finally, we highlight concepts that require further investigation and development, and emphasize new approaches to fairness that may be relevant to the design of clinical trials."

- **Reasoning:** Uses transfer learning to align features across sepsis datasets; no diabetes focus, so most diabetes‑specific criteria are irrelevant. Mentions population bias mitigation, giving modest relevance to bias analysis.","Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has an extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early detection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods often identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based system to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more time to intervene.
  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient information or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab results. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their ability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we propose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which identifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features across multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically relevant.
  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to population bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained on diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models contribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across different patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in hospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery."

- **Reasoning:** Uses differentiable architecture search and foveated operators for multimodal medical image fusion, but focuses on general imaging, not diabetes, and lacks clinical decision or fairness components.","Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) is highly significant in such fields as disease diagnosis and treatment. The traditional MMIF methods are difficult to provide satisfactory fusion accuracy and robustness due to the influence of such possible human-crafted components as image transform and fusion strategies. Existing deep learning based fusion methods are generally difficult to ensure image fusion effect due to the adoption of a human-designed network structure and a relatively simple loss function and the ignorance of human visual characteristics during weight learning. To address these issues, we have presented the foveated differentiable architecture search (F-DARTS) based unsupervised MMIF method. In this method, the foveation operator is introduced into the weight learning process to fully explore human visual characteristics for the effective image fusion. Meanwhile, a distinctive unsupervised loss function is designed for network training by integrating mutual information, sum of the correlations of differences, structural similarity and edge preservation value. Based on the presented foveation operator and loss function, an end-to-end encoder-decoder network architecture will be searched using the F-DARTS to produce the fused image. Experimental results on three multimodal medical image datasets demonstrate that the F-DARTS performs better than several traditional and deep learning based fusion methods by providing visually superior fused results and better objective evaluation metrics.

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep learning for unsupervised image-to-image translation and proposes metrics; no diabetes focus, but involves domain adaptation and image processing relevant to medical imaging.","The ability to classify images accurately and efficiently is dependent on having access to large labeled datasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model is trained on. Classification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a different domain, where collecting a large labeled dataset and training a new classifier from scratch is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes infeasible or impossible. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this data domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image (UI2I) translation models to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled domain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised nature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional supervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved checkpoint model. In this paper, we introduce a new method called Pseudo Supervised Metrics that was designed specifically to support cross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used metrics such as the FID which was designed to evaluate the model in terms of the quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. We show that our metric not only outperforms unsupervised metrics such as the FID, but is also highly correlated with the true supervised metrics, robust, and explainable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can be used as a standard metric for future research in this field by applying it to a critical real-world problem (the boiling crisis problem). "

AI based computer-assisted diagnosis tools can have a tremendous benefit if they can outperform or perform similarly to the level of a clinical expert. As a result, advanced healthcare services can be affordable in developing nations, and the problem of a lack of expert medical practitioners can be addressed. AI based tools can save time, resources, and overall cost for patient treatment. Furthermore, in contrast to humans, AI can uncover complex relations in the data from a large set of inputs and even lead to new evidence-based knowledge in medicine. However, integrating AI in healthcare raises several ethical and philosophical concerns, such as bias, transparency, autonomy, responsibility and accountability, which must be addressed before integrating such tools into clinical settings.

- **Reasoning:** Uses graph‑based channel‑level multimodal fusion for emotion recognition, demonstrating advanced AI/ML and multimodal techniques, but has no diabetes focus, clinical decision aspects, or related nice‑to‑have features.","Physiological signal based ubiquitous computing has garnered significant attention. However, the heterogeneity among multimodal physiological signals poses a critical challenge to practical applications. To traverse this heterogeneity gap, recent studies have focused on establishing inter-modality correlations. Early works only consider coarse-level correlations between the embeddings of each modality. More recent graph-based approaches incorporate prior knowledge-based correlations, although they may not be entirely accurate. In this article, we propose the Graph Joint Fusion (GJFusion) network, which leverages channel-level inter-modality correlations based on a graph joint to mitigate the heterogeneous gap. Our proposed GJFusion first represents each modality as a graph, with each vertex corresponding to a signal channel, and the edges denoting their functional connectivity. We then join each modality by constructing inter-modality correlations for each salient channel using a sampling-based matching method. Discarded channels are transformed into a virtual vertex through a lightweight pooling operation. Subsequently, the fusion network integrates intra- and inter-modality features, enabling multimodal physiological signal fusion. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we select emotional state recognition as the downstream task and conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed GJFusion network surpasses the latest state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative accuracy improvements of 1.22% and 0.81% on the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets, respectively. Furthermore, visualization experiments of the salient brain regions reveal the presence of interpretable knowledge within the proposed GJFusion model."

- **Reasoning:** Introduces an interpretative multimodal fusion framework, but focuses on generic datasets; no diabetes application, clinical decision support, or privacy/fairness aspects.","Multi-modal classification (MMC) aims to integrate the complementary information from different modalities to improve classification performance. Existing MMC methods can be grouped into two categories: traditional methods and deep learning-based methods. The traditional methods often implement fusion in a low-level original space. Besides, they mostly focus on the inter-modal fusion and neglect the intra-modal fusion. Thus, the representation capacity of fused features induced by them is insufficient. The deep learning-based methods implement the fusion in a high-level feature space where the associations among features are considered, while the whole process is implicit and the fused space lacks interpretability. Based on these observations, we propose a novel interpretative association-based fusion method for MMC, named AF. In AF, both the association information and the high-order information extracted from feature space are simultaneously encoded into a new feature space to help to train an MMC model in an explicit manner. Moreover, AF is a general fusion framework, and most existing MMC methods can be embedded into it to improve their performance. Finally, the effectiveness and the generality of AF are validated on 22 datasets, four typically traditional MMC methods adopting best modality, early, late and model fusion strategies and a deep learning-based MMC method.

- **Reasoning:** Uses domain adaptation and random transformations to improve cross‑domain image classification; however, it does not involve diabetes, clinical decision support, or related medical modalities.","Data augmentation has been widely used to improve generalization in training deep neural networks. Recent works show that using worst-case transformations or adversarial augmentation strategies can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness. However, due to the non-differentiable properties of image transformations, searching algorithms such as reinforcement learning or evolution strategy have to be applied, which are not computationally practical for large scale problems. In this work, we show that by simply applying consistency training with random data augmentation, state-of-the-art results on domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) can be obtained. To further improve the accuracy and robustness with adversarial examples, we propose a differentiable adversarial data augmentation method based on spatial transformer networks (STN). The combined adversarial and random transformations based method outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple DA and DG benchmark datasets. Besides, the proposed method shows desirable robustness to corruption, which is also validated on commonly used datasets. "

- **Reasoning:** Introduces PU domain adaptation, a novel DA technique, but focuses on general image classification and parking prediction; no diabetes application or clinical decision aspects.","Domain Adaptation methodologies have shown to effectively generalize from a labeled source domain to a label scarce target domain. Previous research has either focused on unlabeled domain adaptation without any target supervision or semi-supervised domain adaptation with few labeled target examples per class. On the other hand Positive-Unlabeled (PU-) Learning has attracted increasing interest in the weakly supervised learning literature since in quite some real world applications positive labels are much easier to obtain than negative ones. In this work we are the first to introduce the challenge of Positive-Unlabeled Domain Adaptation where we aim to generalise from a fully labeled source domain to a target domain where only positive and unlabeled data is available. We present a novel two-step learning approach to this problem by firstly identifying reliable positive and negative pseudo-labels in the target domain guided by source domain labels and a positive-unlabeled risk estimator. This enables us to use a standard classifier on the target domain in a second step. We validate our approach by running experiments on benchmark datasets for visual object recognition. Furthermore we propose real world examples for our setting and validate our superior performance on parking occupancy data. "

A proper domain adaptation method can significantly enhance the statistical power by pooling data acquired from multiple sites/centers. To this end, we have developed the Domain Adaptation Toolbox for Medical data analysis (DomainATM) - an open-source software package designed for fast facilitation and easy customization of domain adaptation methods for medical data analysis. The DomainATM is implemented in MATLAB with a user-friendly graphical interface, and it consists of a collection of popular data adaptation algorithms that have been extensively applied to medical image analysis and computer vision. With DomainATM, researchers are able to facilitate fast feature-level and image-level adaptation, visualization and performance evaluation of different adaptation methods for medical data analysis. More importantly, the DomainATM enables the users to develop and test their own adaptation methods through scripting, greatly enhancing its utility and extensibility. An overview characteristic and usage of DomainATM is presented and illustrated with three example experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness, simplicity, and flexibility.

Multi-modal medical data fusion based on deep learning can effectively extract and integrate characteristic information of different modes, improve clinical applicability in diagnosis and medical evaluation, and provide quantitative analysis, real-time monitoring, and treatment planning. This study investigates the performance of existing multi-modal fusion pre-training algorithms and medical multi-modal fusion methods and compares their key characteristics, such as supported medical data, diseases, target samples, and implementation performance. Additionally, we present the main challenges and goals of the latest trends in multi-modal medical convergence. To provide a clearer perspective on new trends, we also analyzed relevant papers on the Web of Science. We obtain some meaningful results based on the annual development trends, country, institution, and journal-level research, highly cited papers, and research directions. Finally, we perform co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and bibliographic coupling analysis using the VOSviewer software. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses active learning with deep models for MRI/CT segmentation, achieving high accuracy with limited data. No diabetes focus, clinical decision, multimodal, federated, bias, or transfer learning aspects.","Active learning is a unique abstraction of machine learning techniques where the model/algorithm could guide users for annotation of a set of data points that would be beneficial to the model, unlike passive machine learning. The primary advantage being that active learning frameworks select data points that can accelerate the learning process of a model and can reduce the amount of data needed to achieve full accuracy as compared to a model trained on a randomly acquired data set. Multiple frameworks for active learning combined with deep learning have been proposed, and the majority of them are dedicated to classification tasks. Herein, we explore active learning for the task of segmentation of medical imaging data sets. We investigate our proposed framework using two datasets: 1.) MRI scans of the hippocampus, 2.) CT scans of pancreas and tumors. This work presents a query-by-committee approach for active learning where a joint optimizer is used for the committee. At the same time, we propose three new strategies for active learning: 1.) increasing frequency of uncertain data to bias the training data set; 2.) Using mutual information among the input images as a regularizer for acquisition to ensure diversity in the training dataset; 3.) adaptation of Dice log-likelihood for Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). The results indicate an improvement in terms of data reduction by achieving full accuracy while only using 22.69 % and 48.85 % of the available data for each dataset, respectively."

In recent years, this debate has gained significant attention due to the increasing adoption of AI systems in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. While prediction and explainability are desirable goals in principle, the recent spread of high accuracy yet opaque machine learning (ML) algorithms has highlighted the trade-off between the two, marking this debate as an inter-disciplinary, inter-professional arena for negotiating expertise. There is no longer an agreement about what should be the “default” balance of prediction and explainability, with various positions reflecting claims for professional jurisdiction. Overall, there appears to be a growing schism between the regulatory and ethics-based call for explainability as a condition for trustworthy AI, and how it is being designed, assimilated, and negotiated. The impetus for writing this commentary comes from recent suggestions that explainability is overrated, including the argument that explainability is not guaranteed in human healthcare experts either. To shed light on this debate, its premises, and its recent twists, we provide an overview of key arguments representing different frames, focusing on AI in healthcare. "

Domain adaptation present, yet unrelated to diabetes.","Prostate Cancer (PCa) is often diagnosed using High-resolution 3.0 Tesla(T) MRI, which has been widely established in clinics. However, there are still many medical centers that use 1.5T MRI units in the actual diagnostic process of PCa. In the past few years, deep learning-based models have been proven to be efficient on the PCa classification task and can be successfully used to support radiologists during the diagnostic process. However, training such models often requires a vast amount of data, and sometimes it is unobtainable in practice. Additionally, multi-source MRIs can pose challenges due to cross-domain distribution differences. In this paper, we have presented a novel approach for unpaired image-to-image translation of prostate mp-MRI for classifying clinically significant PCa, to be applied in data-constrained settings. First, we introduce domain transfer, a novel pipeline to translate unpaired 3.0T multi-parametric prostate MRIs to 1.5T, to increase the number of training data. Second, we estimate the uncertainty of our models through an evidential deep learning approach; and leverage the dataset filtering technique during the training process. Furthermore, we introduce a simple, yet efficient Evidential Focal Loss that incorporates the focal loss with evidential uncertainty to train our model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) by over 20% compared to the previous work (98.4% vs. 76.2%). We envision that providing prediction uncertainty to radiologists may help them focus more on uncertain cases and thus expedite the diagnostic process effectively.

Now most CGMs (Medtronic-Guardian, Dexcom-G6, and Abbott-Libre-2) have MARD values of < 10%, in contrast to two decades ago when the MARD used to be > 20%. In addition, the majority of the new CGMs do not require calibrations, and the latest CGMs last for 10-14 days. An implantable 6-months CGM by Eversense-3 is now approved in the USA and Europe. Recently, the FDA approved Libre 3 which provides real-time glucose values every minute. Even though it is approved as an iCGM it is not interoperable with automatic-insulin-delivery (AID) systems. The newer CGMs that are likely to be launched in the next few months in the USA include the 10-11 days Dexcom G7 (60% smaller than the existing G6), and the 7-days Medtronic Guardian 4. Most of the newer CGM have several features like automatic initialization, easy insertion, predictive alarms, and alerts. It has also been noticed that an arm insertion site might have better accuracy than abdomen or other sites, like the buttock for kids. Lag time between YSI and different sensors have been reported differently, sometimes it is down to 2-3 min; however, in many instances, it is still 15-20 min, especially when the rate of change of glucose is > 2 mg/min.

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning and blockchain for risk‑based access control in healthcare, but focuses on general patient risk, not diabetes, and lacks clinical decision or trustworthiness analysis specific to diabetic care.","Modern healthcare systems operate in highly dynamic environments requiring adaptable access control mechanisms. Access to sensitive data and medical equipment should be granted or denied according to the current health situation of the patient. To handle the need for adaptable access control of healthcare scenarios, we propose a novel model that allows dynamic access control decisions based on the context characterizing the source, type of access request, patient, and estimated risk corresponding to the conditions of the patient. Estimating patient status risk requires analyzing vital physiological data whose availability is growing, thanks to the widespread diffusion of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. Inferring the patient health status risk through machine learning (ML) techniques is possible, but to achieve better accuracy, the training phase requires the aggregation of vast amounts of data from different sources. This aggregation could be difficult or even impossible due to organization regulations and privacy laws. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel federated learning risk-based authorization middleware for healthcare (FRAMH) that supports risk-based access control to deal with changing and unforeseen medical situations. Our solution infers the risk of health status through a federated learning (FL) approach enriched with blockchain to avoid the weaknesses of centralized servers. The implemented prototype and a large set of experimental results demonstrate the advantages of FL in estimating the risk in healthcare scenarios. Through this approach, even a medical institution with a limited dataset can achieve a satisfying risk estimation and efficient access control enforcement. "

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on mobile app usage for diabetes self‑care; lacks any AI/ML methods, model application, or trustworthiness considerations.","Pakistani population is ranked number 3rd in the prevalence of diabetes after India and China. Its self-management has been considered a keystone for the care of the disease. It is imperative to take measures that can help diabetic patients to maintain self-management. Recent advancements in the field of information technology, such as digital applications, might help to create a platform for delivering and managing self-care interventions that would be easily accessible. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the frequency of utilization of smartphone technology for self-care. A multi-centric, cross-sectional study was conducted. The results of the study showed that most patients use smartphones but only a few users were aware of health applications for self-care of diabetes. Most patients were using health applications for their self-management only when they are in need. In conclusion, most patients in Pakistan use smart phone but they do not utilise health care mobile applications appropriately due to the lack of awareness. Given the increasing number of patients it is essential to provide public health awareness regarding use of these applications so that patients can manage their glycaemic control at home with convenience. This will also reduce burden on health care system. "

- **Reasoning:** Uses federated learning to create Byzantine‑resilient FL, but focuses on ECG health monitoring, not diabetes; no diabetes data, imaging, or bias analysis.","Federated learning (FL) enables an effective and private distributed learning process. However, it is vulnerable against several types of attacks, such as Byzantine behaviors. The first purpose of this work is to demonstrate mathematically that traditional arithmetic-averaging model-combining approach will ultimately diverge to an unstable solution in the presence of Byzantine agents. This article also proposes a low-complexity, decentralized Byzantine resilient training mechanism. The proposed technique identifies and isolates hostile nodes rather than just mitigating their impact on the global model. In addition, the suggested approach may be used alone or in conjunction with other protection techniques to provide an additional layer of security in the event of misdetection. The suggested solution is decentralized, allowing all participating nodes to jointly identify harmful individuals using a novel cross-check mechanism. To prevent biased assessments, the identification procedure is done blindly and is incorporated into the regular training process. A smart activation mechanism based on flag activation is also proposed to reduce the network overhead. Finally, general mathematical proofs combined with extensive experimental results applied in a healthcare electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring scenario show that the proposed techniques are very efficient at accurately predicting heart problems.

- **Reasoning:** Uses CycleGAN‑based unsupervised domain transfer for portal vein segmentation in CTA images; no diabetes application, clinical decision, or related multimodal/federated aspects.","Background: Clinically, physicians diagnose portal vein diseases on abdominal CT angiography (CTA) images scanned in the hepatic arterial phase (H-phase), portal vein phase (P-phase) and equilibrium phase (E-phase) simultaneously. However, existing studies typically segment the portal vein on P-phase images without considering other phase images. Method: We propose a method for segmenting portal veins on multiphase images based on unsupervised domain transfer and pseudo labels by using annotated P-phase images. Firstly, unsupervised domain transfer is performed to make the H-phase and E-phase images of the same patient approach the P-phase image in style, reducing the image differences caused by contrast media. Secondly, the H-phase (or E-phase) image and its style transferred image are input into the segmentation module together with the P-phase image. Under the constraints of pseudo labels, accurate prediction results are obtained. Results: This method was evaluated on the multiphase CTA images of 169 patients. The portal vein segmented from the H-phase and E-phase images achieved DSC values of 0.76 and 0.86 and Jaccard values of 0.61 and 0.76, respectively. Conclusion: The method can automatically segment the portal vein on H-phase and E-phase images when only the portal vein on the P-phase CTA image is annotated, which greatly assists in clinical diagnosis."

Data sources included (1) observations during app testing and (2) survey responses on desired app features. Guided by the SDT, coding categories included app functions that could address psychological needs for motivation in self-management: competence, autonomy, and connectivity. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Patients described design features that addressed needs for &lt;i&gt;competence, autonomy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;connectivity&lt;/i&gt;. To promote &lt;i&gt;competence&lt;/i&gt;, electronic data recording and analysis should help patients track and understand blood glucose (BG) results necessary for planning behavior changes. To promote &lt;i&gt;autonomy&lt;/i&gt;, BG trend analysis should empower patients to set safe and practical personalized behavioral goals based on time and the day of the week. To promote &lt;i&gt;connectivity&lt;/i&gt;, app email or messaging function could share data reports and communicate with others on self-management advice. Additional themes that emerged are the top general app designs to promote positive user experience: patient-friendly; automatic features of data upload; voice recognition to eliminate typing data; alert or reminder on self-management activities; and app interactivity of a sound, message, or emoji change in response to keeping or not keeping BG in the target range. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> The application of the SDT was useful in identifying motivational app designs that address the psychological needs of &lt;i&gt;competence&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;autonomy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;connectivity&lt;/i&gt;. User-centered design concepts, such as being patient-friendly, differ from the SDT because patients need a positive user experience (ie, a technology need). Patients want engaging diabetes apps that go beyond data input and output. Apps should be easy to use, provide personalized analysis reports, be interactive to affirm positive behaviors, facilitate data sharing, and support patient-clinician communication. </sec> "

First, a continual learning model should effectively handle catastrophic forgetting and be efficient to train even with a large number of tasks. Secondly, it needs to tackle the problem of order-sensitivity, where the performance of the tasks largely varies based on the order of the task arrival sequence, as it may cause serious problems where fairness plays a critical role (e.g. medical diagnosis). To tackle these practical challenges, we propose a novel continual learning method that is scalable as well as order-robust, which instead of learning a completely shared set of weights, represents the parameters for each task as a sum of task-shared and sparse task-adaptive parameters. With our Additive Parameter Decomposition (APD), the task-adaptive parameters for earlier tasks remain mostly unaffected, where we update them only to reflect the changes made to the task-shared parameters. This decomposition of parameters effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting and order-sensitivity, while being computation- and memory-efficient. Further, we can achieve even better scalability with APD using hierarchical knowledge consolidation, which clusters the task-adaptive parameters to obtain hierarchically shared parameters. We validate our network with APD, APD-Net, on multiple benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art continual learning methods, which it largely outperforms in accuracy, scalability, and order-robustness."

There is a scarcity of large-scale analysis of literature in this field based on quantitative approaches. This study performed a bibliometric and topic modeling examination on 683 articles from 2002 to 2022, focusing on research topics and trends, journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors, and scientific collaborations. Results showed that, firstly, the number of articles has grown from 1 in 2002 to 220 in 2022, with a majority being published in interdisciplinary journals that link healthcare and medical research and information technology and AI. Secondly, the significant rise in the quantity of research articles can be attributed to the increasing contribution of scholars from non-English speaking countries/regions and the noteworthy contributions made by authors in the USA and India. Thirdly, researchers show a high interest in diverse research issues, especially, cross-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor analysis, cancer prognosis through multi-dimensional data analysis, and AI-assisted diagnostics and personalization in healthcare, with each topic experiencing a significant increase in research interest. There is an emerging trend towards issues such as applying generative adversarial networks and contrastive learning for multimodal medical image fusion and synthesis and utilizing the combined spatiotemporal resolution of functional MRI and electroencephalogram in a data-centric manner. This study is valuable in enhancing researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of the present focal points and upcoming trajectories in AI-powered smart healthcare based on multimodal data analysis.

Health AI should be resilient against real-world environments throughout its lifecycle, including the training and prediction phases and maintenance during production, and health AI regulations should evolve accordingly. Data quality issues, variability over time or across sites, information uncertainty, human-computer interaction, and fundamental rights assurance are among the most relevant challenges.

Objective: This study developed a critical appraisal tool extension to assess algorithmic bias in clinical prediction models. Methods: A modified e-Delphi approach was utilized to develop and obtain expert consensus on a set of racial and ethnic equity-based signaling questions for appraisal of risk of bias in clinical prediction models. Through a series of virtual meetings, initial pilot application, and an online survey, individuals with expertise in clinical prediction model development, systematic review methodology, and health equity developed and refined this tool. Results: Consensus was reached for ten equity-based signaling questions, which led to the development of the Critical Appraisal for Racial and Ethnic Equity in Clinical Prediction Models (CARE-CPM) extension. This extension is intended for use along with existing critical appraisal tools for clinical prediction models. Conclusion: CARE-CPM provides a valuable risk-of-bias assessment tool extension for clinical prediction models to identify potential algorithmic bias and health equity concerns.

- **Reasoning:** Discusses contextual bias and fairness in medical AI, highlighting regulatory and validation needs, but provides no specific AI methods, diabetes-focused models, or multimodal/federated approaches.","Artificial intelligence will transform medicine. One particularly attractive possibility is the democratization of medical expertise. If black-box medical algorithms can be trained to match the performance of high-level human experts — to identify malignancies as well as trained radiologists, to diagnose diabetic retinopathy as well as board-certified ophthalmologists, or to recommend tumor-specific courses of treatment as well as top-ranked oncologists — then those algorithms could be deployed in medical settings where human experts are not available, and patients could benefit. 

But there is a problem with this vision. Privacy law, malpractice, insurance reimbursement, and FDA approval standards all encourage developers to train medical AI in high-resource contexts, such as academic medical centers. And put simply, care is different in high-resource settings than it is in low-resource settings such as community health centers or rural providers in less-developed countries. Patient populations differ, as do the resources available to administer treatment and the resources available to pay for that treatment. This development pattern will lead to decreases in the quality of the algorithm’s recommendations, reflected in problematic care and increased costs. Perniciously, such quality problems in low-resource contexts are likely to go unrecognized for exactly the same reasons that promote algorithmic training in high-resource contexts.

Solutions are not trivial. Labeling products the same way that drugs are labeled is unlikely to work, and truly addressing the problem may require a combination of public investment in data to train medical AI and regulatory requirements for cross-context validation. Nevertheless, if black-box medicine is to achieve its goal of bringing excellent medicine to broad sets of patients, the problem of contextual bias should be recognized and addressed sooner rather than later."

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on bias mitigation in AI health equity, offering a lifecycle framework and fairness metrics, but does not target diabetes, specific AI models, or multimodal/federated approaches.","Abstract Health equity is a primary goal of healthcare stakeholders: patients and their advocacy groups, clinicians, other providers and their professional societies, bioethicists, payors and value based care organizations, regulatory agencies, legislators, and creators of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled medical devices. Lack of equitable access to diagnosis and treatment may be improved through new digital health technologies, especially AI/ML, but these may also exacerbate disparities, depending on how bias is addressed. We propose an expanded Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) framework for healthcare AI/ML, describing the sources and impacts of undesirable bias in AI/ML systems in each phase, how these can be analyzed using appropriate metrics, and how they can be potentially mitigated. The goal of these “Considerations” is to educate stakeholders on how potential AI/ML bias may impact healthcare outcomes and how to identify and mitigate inequities; to initiate a discussion between stakeholders on these issues, in order to ensure health equity along the expanded AI/ML TPLC framework, and ultimately, better health outcomes for all.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on racial bias assessment and mitigation in clinical ML models across various domains, but does not involve diabetes or related AI applications.","Background Racial bias is a key concern regarding the development, validation, and implementation of machine learning (ML) models in clinical settings. Despite the potential of bias to propagate health disparities, racial bias in clinical ML has yet to be thoroughly examined and best practices for bias mitigation remain unclear. Objective Our objective was to perform a scoping review to characterize the methods by which the racial bias of ML has been assessed and describe strategies that may be used to enhance algorithmic fairness in clinical ML. Methods A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases, as well as Google Scholar, identified 635 records, of which 12 studies were included. Results Applications of ML were varied and involved diagnosis, outcome prediction, and clinical score prediction performed on data sets including images, diagnostic studies, clinical text, and clinical variables. Of the 12 studies, 1 (8%) described a model in routine clinical use, 2 (17%) examined prospectively validated clinical models, and the remaining 9 (75%) described internally validated models. In addition, 8 (67%) studies concluded that racial bias was present, 2 (17%) concluded that it was not, and 2 (17%) assessed the implementation of bias mitigation strategies without comparison to a baseline model. Fairness metrics used to assess algorithmic racial bias were inconsistent. The most commonly observed metrics were equal opportunity difference (5/12, 42%), accuracy (4/12, 25%), and disparate impact (2/12, 17%). All 8 (67%) studies that implemented methods for mitigation of racial bias successfully increased fairness, as measured by the authors’ chosen metrics. Preprocessing methods of bias mitigation were most commonly used across all studies that implemented them. Conclusions The broad scope of medical ML applications and potential patient harms demand an increased emphasis on evaluation and mitigation of racial bias in clinical ML. However, the adoption of algorithmic fairness principles in medicine remains inconsistent and is limited by poor data availability and ML model reporting. We recommend that researchers and journal editors emphasize standardized reporting and data availability in medical ML studies to improve transparency and facilitate evaluation for racial bias."

- **Reasoning:** Discusses bias mitigation, interpretability, and validation for medical AI, but lacks any diabetes focus, specific AI techniques, or multimodal/federated implementations.","Biases in medical artificial intelligence (AI) arise and compound throughout the AI lifecycle. These biases can have significant clinical consequences, especially in applications that involve clinical decision-making. Left unaddressed, biased medical AI can lead to substandard clinical decisions and the perpetuation and exacerbation of longstanding healthcare disparities. We discuss potential biases that can arise at different stages in the AI development pipeline and how they can affect AI algorithms and clinical decision-making. Bias can occur in data features and labels, model development and evaluation, deployment, and publication. Insufficient sample sizes for certain patient groups can result in suboptimal performance, algorithm underestimation, and clinically unmeaningful predictions. Missing patient findings can also produce biased model behavior, including capturable but nonrandomly missing data, such as diagnosis codes, and data that is not usually or not easily captured, such as social determinants of health. Expertly annotated labels used to train supervised learning models may reflect implicit cognitive biases or substandard care practices. Overreliance on performance metrics during model development may obscure bias and diminish a model's clinical utility. When applied to data outside the training cohort, model performance can deteriorate from previous validation and can do so differentially across subgroups. How end users interact with deployed solutions can introduce bias. Finally, where models are developed and published, and by whom, impacts the trajectories and priorities of future medical AI development. Solutions to mitigate bias must be implemented with care, which include the collection of large and diverse data sets, statistical debiasing methods, thorough model evaluation, emphasis on model interpretability, and standardized bias reporting and transparency requirements. Prior to real-world implementation in clinical settings, rigorous validation through clinical trials is critical to demonstrate unbiased application. Addressing biases across model development stages is crucial for ensuring all patients benefit equitably from the future of medical AI. "

Melissa McCradden et al.’s “A Research Ethics Framework for the Clinical Translation of Healthcare Machine Learning” puts pressure on this tension while still attempting not to break it—trying to impute structure and epistemic consistency where it is currently lacking (McCradden et al. 2022). They highlight an “AI chasm” “generated by a clash between the... cultures of computer science and clinical science,” but argue that the “ethical norms of human subjects research” are still the right pathway to bridge this divide. The Open Peer Commentaries included in this issue agree with this central premise while critiquing the insufficiency of current ethics and regulatory solutions to adequately protect communities at higher risk for ML bias. The current U.S. human subjects research regulations (HSRR) were developed from traditional conceptions of research ethics (Schupmann and Moreno 2020). Research ethicists have subsequently been asked to apply existing concepts to new areas over which the regulatory structure does not reach. AI/ML is an excellent example of the strengths and limitations of this current default."

Race-based medicine, which relies on algorithms that use race as a proxy for biological differences, has led to treatment patterns that are inappropriate, unjust, and harmful to minoritized racial and ethnic groups. These patterns have contributed to persistent disparities in health and health care. To reduce these disparities, we recommend a race-aware approach to clinical decision support that considers social and environmental factors such as structural racism and social determinants of health. Recent policy changes in medical specialty societies and innovations in algorithm development represent progress on the path to dismantling race-based medicine. Success will require continued commitment and sustained efforts among stakeholders in the health care, research, and technology sectors. Increasing the diversity of clinical trial populations, broadening the focus of precision medicine, improving education about the complex factors shaping health outcomes, and developing new guidelines and policies to enable culturally responsive care are important next steps.

The lack of consideration for equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in the lifecycle of AI within healthcare settings may intensify social and health inequities, potentially causing harm to under-represented populations. This article describes the protocol for a scoping review of the literature relating to integration of EDI in the AI interventions within healthcare setting. The objective of the review is to evaluate what has been done on integrating EDI concepts, principles and practices in the lifecycles of AI interventions within healthcare settings. It also aims to explore which EDI concepts, principles and practices have been integrated into the design, development and implementation of AI in healthcare settings. Method and analysis The scoping review will be guided by the six-step methodological framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley supplemented by Levac et al, and Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping reviews. Relevant literature will be identified by searching seven electronic databases in engineering/computer science and healthcare, and searching the reference lists and citations of studies that meet the inclusion criteria. Studies on AI in any healthcare and geographical settings, that have considered aspects of EDI, published in English and French between 2005 and present will be considered. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles according to inclusion criteria. We will conduct a thematic analysis and use a narrative description to describe the work. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Extracted data will be summarised and analysed to address aims of the scoping review. Reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. The study began in April 2022 and is expected to end in September 2023. The database initial searches resulted in 5,745 records when piloted in April 2022. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. The study will map the available literature on EDI concepts, principles and practices in AI interventions within healthcare settings, highlight the significance of this context, and offer insights into the best practices for incorporating EDI into AI-based solutions in healthcare settings. The results will be disseminated through open-access peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, social media and 2-day workshops with relevant stakeholders. "

This review examines over 310,000 journal articles and patents from the CAS Content Collection (2015–2025), with a focus on, biomedical research, and materials science. Our data-supported trend analysis finds that since 2020, AI-related publications have surged across both academic and industrial domains. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods, such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, remain foundational, particularly in molecular property prediction and classification tasks. However, there is an increased adoption of advanced neural network architectures, including graph neural networks for molecular representation and generative models for de novo compound design. Hybrid and ensemble approaches that integrate traditional algorithms with deep learning are increasingly favored for their robustness and adaptability. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, and GEMINI are transforming literature mining, hypothesis generation, and experimental planning. Domain-specific models such as AlphaFold and chemical language models enable breakthroughs in protein structure prediction and reaction outcome forecasting. Industrial chemistry and chemical engineering are increasingly contributing to AI-driven academic publications, while biochemistry patents have grown eightfold, reflecting AI’s dual impact on discovery and commercialization. Despite these advances, challenges remain, particularly in data privacy, quality, interpretability of black-box models, and uncertainty quantification. These findings highlight AI’s transition from descriptor-based approaches to end-to-end learning systems, offering essential insights for researchers and policymakers navigating its transformative role in science.

However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare."

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on vaginal microbiome and drug distribution, with no diabetes context, AI/ML methods, or clinical decision aspects related to diabetes.","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: An ex-vivo tissue model has been developed to predict target concentrations of tenofovir diphosphate (TFVdp; active metabolite of tenofovir) but has not been utilized to see how vaginal dysbiosis affects TFVdp/dATP exposure in female genital tract (FGT). My central hypothesis is that presence of specific anaerobic bacteria will increase dATP in FGT. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: De-identified HIV-negative cervical tissues from women undergoing gynecological surgeries will be procured and a punch biopsy will be used to create explants. TFVdp/dATP concentrations were both tested in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions after a 24-hour incubation in tenofovir (TFV) to determine any changes between conditions. TFVdp/dATP in cervical tissue was be measured using LC-MS. Next, media and explants were collected at baseline to characterize donor microbiome for 6 donors. 16S microbiome sequencing was performed on extracted DNA to obtain the relative abundances of each bacteria species present. To test changes in dATP/TFVdp due to the microbiome, explants will be incubated in TFV for 24 hours with Prevotella and Dialister to specifically see how microbiomes dominated by these taxa affect dATP. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TFVdp formation between aerobic and anaerobic conditions after a 24-hour tenofovir incubation (p = 0.2) for 8 donors. dATP was not quantifiable at 24 hours in explants, so explants are being collected before 24hrs during a TFV incubation to determine how quickly dATP depletes after collection. We were able to characterize the donor microbiome in media and tissue at baseline and 24hrs which had inter variability. We did not see any presence of Prevotella or Dialister in any donors. We are working on characterizing bacteria growth over time to see how the donor microbiome would change during a 24 hour experiment in anaerobic conditions. Finally, we anticipate seeing increases in dATP with a Prevotella or Dialister supplemented donor microbiome compared to baseline donor microbiome. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The addition of vaginal dysbiosis to tissue model will increase accuracy of prediction of 100% protective TFVdp concentrations and is likely to provide a translational model that can be used to improve TFV-based PrEP in women and streamline development of future PrEP candidates, bringing more prevention options to women and ending the HIV epidemic."

Current ML/AI models are prone to accentuate racial disparities. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of how AI/ML models perpetuate racial biases and how we can mitigate this situation. A narrative review of articles published in the medical literature on racial biases and the use of AI/ML models was undertaken. Current AI/ML models are built on homogenous clinical datasets that have a gross underrepresentation of historically disadvantages demographic groups, especially the ethno-racial minorities. The consequence of such AI/ML models is that they perform poorly when deployed on ethno-racial minorities thus further amplifying racial biases. Healthcare providers, policymakers, AI developers and all stakeholders should pay close attention to various steps in the pipeline of building AI/ML models and every effort must be made to establish algorithmic fairness to redress inequities."

There is increasing concern for the potential impact of health care algorithms on racial and ethnic disparities.


PURPOSE
To examine the evidence on how health care algorithms and associated mitigation strategies affect racial and ethnic disparities.


DATA SOURCES
Several databases were searched for relevant studies published from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2023.


STUDY SELECTION
Using predefined criteria and dual review, studies were screened and selected to determine: 1) the effect of algorithms on racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care outcomes and 2) the effect of strategies or approaches to mitigate racial and ethnic bias in the development, validation, dissemination, and implementation of algorithms.


DATA EXTRACTION
Outcomes of interest (that is, access to health care, quality of care, and health outcomes) were extracted with risk-of-bias assessment using the ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool and adapted CARE-CPM (Critical Appraisal for Racial and Ethnic Equity in Clinical Prediction Models) equity extension.


DATA SYNTHESIS
Sixty-three studies (51 modeling, 4 retrospective, 2 prospective, 5 prepost studies, and 1 randomized controlled trial) were included. Heterogenous evidence on algorithms was found to: a) reduce disparities (for example, the revised kidney allocation system), b) perpetuate or exacerbate disparities (for example, severity-of-illness scores applied to critical care resource allocation), and/or c) have no statistically significant effect on select outcomes (for example, the HEART Pathway [history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors, and troponin]). To mitigate disparities, 7 strategies were identified: removing an input variable, replacing a variable, adding race, adding a non-race-based variable, changing the racial and ethnic composition of the population used in model development, creating separate thresholds for subpopulations, and modifying algorithmic analytic techniques.


LIMITATION
Results are mostly based on modeling studies and may be highly context-specific.


CONCLUSION
Algorithms can mitigate, perpetuate, and exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities, regardless of the explicit use of race and ethnicity, but evidence is heterogeneous. Intentionality and implementation of the algorithm can impact the effect on disparities, and there may be tradeoffs in outcomes.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on COVID-19 CT classification using distant domain transfer learning; no diabetes application, no clinical decision support for diabetes, and lacks the listed nice‑to‑have diabetes‑specific aspects.","Medical image processing is one of the most important topics in the field of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Recently, deep learning methods have carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical image tasks. However, conventional deep learning have two main drawbacks: 1) insufficient training data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data. In this paper, we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue (Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even when the domains or the tasks are entirely different. In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Catech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled data collected from distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\% classification accuracy, which is 13\% higher classification accuracy than ""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8\% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms."

- **Reasoning:** Reviews AI interpretability in CDSS broadly; no focus on diabetes, no specific AI methods applied to diabetic problems, and lacks clinical decision or trustworthiness details for diabetes.","Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly, and its application extends to clinical decision support system (CDSS) for improving healthcare quality. However, the interpretability of AI-driven CDSS poses significant challenges to widespread application. Objective This study is a review of the knowledge-based and data-based CDSS literature regarding interpretability in health care. It highlights the relevance of interpretability for CDSS and the area for improvement from technological and medical perspectives. Methods A systematic search was conducted on the interpretability-related literature published from 2011 to 2020 and indexed in the five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Scopus. Journal articles that focus on the interpretability of CDSS were included for analysis. Experienced researchers also participated in manually reviewing the selected articles for inclusion/exclusion and categorization. Results Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 articles from 16 journals were finally selected for this review. Interpretability, which means a transparent structure of the model, a clear relationship between input and output, and explainability of artificial intelligence algorithms, is essential for CDSS application in the healthcare setting. Methods for improving the interpretability of CDSS include ante-hoc methods such as fuzzy logic, decision rules, logistic regression, decision trees for knowledge-based AI, and white box models, post hoc methods such as feature importance, sensitivity analysis, visualization, and activation maximization for black box models. A number of factors, such as data type, biomarkers, human-AI interaction, needs of clinicians, and patients, can affect the interpretability of CDSS. Conclusions The review explores the meaning of the interpretability of CDSS and summarizes the current methods for improving interpretability from technological and medical perspectives. The results contribute to the understanding of the interpretability of CDSS based on AI in health care. Future studies should focus on establishing formalism for defining interpretability, identifying the properties of interpretability, and developing an appropriate and objective metric for interpretability; in addition, the user's demand for interpretability and how to express and provide explanations are also the directions for future research."

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on open code sharing for reproducibility; does not present AI/ML methods, diabetes applications, or clinical decision support.","Sharing research code in an open access version-controlled repository offers significant benefits for both science as a whole and for individual researchers. In this article, we focus on this practice, which is fully aligned with the NIH's Gold Standard Science (GSS) program as well as FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and TRUST (transparency, responsibility, user focus, sustainability, technology) principles. Gold Standard Science supports open science by emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and the use of best practices that enable others to verify and extend research. Pairing a research article's cited data snapshot with a versioned, environment-specific code release, deposited in a companion code repository, ensures that, upon submission to a medical journal, readers and reviewers can directly verify results. An executable and updatable companion code repository complements, rather than replaces, established research data repositories. When code underlying medical research results is made openly available, then other scientists can inspect, run, and validate analyses. These activities enhance reproducibility, which is a core aim of GSS. Shared code also facilitates collaborative innovation by allowing researchers to extend the utility of the code to new datasets and applications. For researchers, code sharing can increase visibility, credibility, and citation impact. Demonstrating transparency through shared executable and updatable code builds trust with journal readers, peer reviewers, funders, and peers. Shared code in an open access repository signals adherence to high standards of scientific integrity and attracts opportunities for collaboration. A researcher who shares code receives recognition as a leader in reproducible, trustworthy research consistent with NIH's GSS principles."

This represents a major evolution beyond machine learning and large language models (LLM), toward systems capable of planning, executing, and coordinating complex workflows. In contrast to traditional LLMs, which primarily focus on generating and classifying information, agentic AI introduces elements of autonomy, reasoning, and orchestration, while digital twins extend this concept to dynamic virtual representations of patients and laboratory processes, capable of continuous learning, simulation and adaptation. This transition has profound implications for laboratory medicine, a field characterized by high data complexity, multi-omics integration, and stringent operational demands. At the same time, laboratories face growing expectations regarding efficiency, resource stewardship, and value-based healthcare delivery. This article explores both the opportunities and limitations of agentic AI in laboratory medicine, highlighting its potential to move beyond static automation toward autonomous, outcome-driven innovation. It also examines the ethical, interpretability, and governance considerations that must accompany its implementation."

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on endocrine disruptors and biomarker discovery; mentions AI in metabolomics but lacks diabetes-specific AI models, clinical decision support, or related criteria.","Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are external agents that interfere with normal hormone production, release, movement, attachment, activity, and removal. EDCs operate through various mechanisms, including receptor binding, interference with hormone production pathways, modification of hormone-transporting proteins, or disturbance of hormonal metabolic processes. Evidence links EDCs to several health conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Fortunately, the field of biomarker discovery for metabolic and endocrine disorders is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by advancements in metabolomics, multi-omics integration, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced diagnostics. Cutting-edge analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of novel biomarkers for early disease detection, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Metabolomics has played a crucial role in unraveling disease mechanisms, identifying biochemical signatures of metabolic dysfunctions, and bridging traditional and modern medical approaches. However, challenges remain in clinical validation, reproducibility, and specificity of these biomarkers. The incorporation of multi-omics technologies such as genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomic has provided a more comprehensive view of metabolic dysregulation. Future advancements in machine learning, AI-driven data analytics, and single-cell omics are expected to revolutionize precision medicine by enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes. As biomarker research continues to evolve, the convergence of high-throughput technologies, computational approaches, and clinical validation efforts will be critical in ensuring their translation into routine medical practice."

In this study, we analyze fecal and serum metabolomes in first-episode depression and matched controls (n = 186), with validation in three independent cohorts (n = 223, 85, 52) including drug intervention. Significant disruptions are noted in 53 gut microbial species, 12 microbiota-related metabolic pathways, and 34 metabolites in depressive individuals compared to controls. Sixteen metabolites exhibit reversal after drug administration. Partial Spearman analysis identifies 271 species-metabolite correlations, and mediation analysis unveils 61 metabolite-mediated species-depression correlations. Key features associated with depression, including Bifidobacterium longum, Parasutterella excrementihominis, tyrosine, serotonin, and homovanillic acid, are highlighted. A machine learning model with 34 metabolites achieves area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values of 0.82 and 0.80 in discriminating depression from control in test and validation sets.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on sepsis decision support, not diabetes; no diabetic data, models, or related clinical context addressed.","Machine learning technologies are increasingly developed for use in healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to accuracy, fairness, accountability, and transparency that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain under examined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for designing machine learning systems. Our work underscores the limits of model interpretability as a solution to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in practice. Instead, our work demonstrates other means and goals to achieve FATML values in design and in practice."

- **Reasoning:** Review focuses on circulating and genomic biomarkers for diabetes‑stroke risk; contains no AI/ML methods, applications, or related trustworthiness considerations.","Diabetes substantially increases the risk of ischemic stroke through complex metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular mechanisms, yet early identification of high-risk individuals remains challenging. This narrative review synthesizes emerging circulating and genomic biomarkers that illuminate the pathways linking diabetes and ischemic stroke and evaluates their potential for early detection and precise risk stratification. Systematic searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science identified 141 relevant studies examining biomarkers, genetic and epigenetic factors, or risk prediction models in adults with diabetes. Evidence highlights several biomarker domains. Inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-"

- **Reasoning:** Survey of multimodal AI methods without diabetes focus; no specific application, clinical decision support, or privacy/fairness analysis for diabetic healthcare.","Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (Multimodal AI), in general, involves various types of data (e.g., images, texts, or data collected from different sensors), feature engineering (e.g., extraction, combination/fusion), and decision-making (e.g., majority vote). As architectures become more and more sophisticated, multimodal neural networks can integrate feature extraction, feature fusion, and decision-making processes into one single model. The boundaries between those processes are increasingly blurred. The conventional multimodal data fusion taxonomy (e.g., early/late fusion), based on which the fusion occurs in, is no longer suitable for the modern deep learning era. Therefore, based on the main-stream techniques used, we propose a new fine-grained taxonomy grouping the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models into five classes: Encoder-Decoder methods, Attention Mechanism methods, Graph Neural Network methods, Generative Neural Network methods, and other Constraint-based methods. Most existing surveys on multimodal data fusion are only focused on one specific task with a combination of two specific modalities. Unlike those, this survey covers a broader combination of modalities, including Vision + Language (e.g., videos, texts), Vision + Sensors (e.g., images, LiDAR), etc., and their corresponding tasks (e.g., video captioning, object detection). Moreover, a comparison among these methods is provided, as well as challenges and future directions in this area."
