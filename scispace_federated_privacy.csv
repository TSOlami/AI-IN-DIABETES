Due to patient privacy concerns and the centralized nature of current FL approaches, collaborative research in heart disease prediction (HDP) faces significant hurdles in computational health systems. This article introduces a distributed online aggregation method within fully decentralized federated learning (DFL), named DeFedHDP, to address these privacy challenges and improve the model of HDP. Moreover, the differential privacy (DP) mechanism is applied to the aggregation strategy of DeFedHDP to protect the privacy of the patients. The data holder communicates directly with neighbors in a series of time-varying directed graphs without the involvement of a central server. Furthermore, each participant is both a trainer of the local model and a collaborator of the other participants’ models. The data does not leave the local device, only the model parameters are exchanged and integrated, and this decentralized approach can further improve the level of privacy protection. In addition, to cope with model gradient disappearance and gradient explosion, the one-point bandit feedback (OPBF) strategy is utilized to estimate the true gradient values. Experiments on a public medical dataset show that the effectiveness of DeFedHDP is close to the centralized FedAVG algorithm for client-server architectures in terms of accuracy and speed.","This study introduces DeFedHDP, a fully decentralized online federated learning method for heart disease prediction, addressing patient privacy concerns through differential privacy and direct neighbor communication, achieving comparable accuracy and speed to centralized approaches."

Two critical challenges are identified: First, medical data is naturally distributed across multiple local sites, making it difficult to collectively train machine learning models without data leakage. Second, in medical applications, data are often collected from different sources and views, resulting in heterogeneity and complexity that requires reconciliation. In this article, we present a generic Federated Multi-view Learning (FedMV) framework for multi-view data leakage prevention. Specifically, we apply this framework to two types of problems based on local data availability: Vertical Federated Multi-view Learning (V-FedMV) and Horizontal Federated Multi-view Learning (H-FedMV). We experimented with real-world keyboard data collected from BiAffect study. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach can make full use of multi-view data in a privacy-preserving way, and both V-FedMV and H-FedMV perform better than their single-view and pairwise counterparts. Besides, the framework can be easily adapted to deal with multi-view sequential data. We have developed a sequential model (S-FedMV) that takes sequence of multi-view data as input and demonstrated it experimentally. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to consider both vertical and horizontal diversification in the multi-view setting, as well as their sequential federated learning.

Federated learning allows for the utilization of powerful machine learning algorithms without requiring the pooling of data. Healthcare data have many simultaneous challenges, such as highly siloed data, class imbalance, missing data, distribution shifts, and non-standardized variables, that require new methodologies to address. Federated learning adds significant methodological complexity to conventional centralized machine learning, requiring distributed optimization, communication between nodes, aggregation of models, and redistribution of models. In this systematic review, we consider all papers on Scopus published between January 2015 and February 2023 that describe new federated learning methodologies for addressing challenges with healthcare data. We reviewed 89 papers meeting these criteria. Significant systemic issues were identified throughout the literature, compromising many methodologies reviewed.

By allowing multiple devices to train models collaboratively, federated learning is a promising solution to address the communication and privacy issues in e-health. However, applying federated learning in e-health faces many challenges. First, medical data are both horizontally and vertically partitioned. Since single horizontal federated learning (HFL) or vertical federated learning (VFL) techniques cannot deal with both types of data partitioning, directly applying them may consume excessive communication cost due to transmitting a part of raw data when requiring high modeling accuracy. Second, a naive combination of HFL and VFL has limitations including low training efficiency, unsound convergence analysis, and lack of parameter tuning strategies. In this article, we provide a thorough study on an effective integration of HFL and VFL, to achieve communication efficiency and overcome the above limitations when data are both horizontally and vertically partitioned. Specifically, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework with one intermediate result exchange and two aggregation phases. Based on this framework, we develop a hybrid stochastic gradient descent (HSGD) algorithm to train models. Then, we theoretically analyze the convergence upper bound of the proposed algorithm.

However, its vulnerability to privacy breaches through shared model weights and susceptibility to a single point of failure remain concerns. Energy constraints of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) necessitate considering computation and transmission energy in the FL process. Thus, this article introduces a smart healthcare system prioritizing energy efficiency and privacy through a blockchain-backed FL model. Yet, WBAN users might be unwilling to share data without adequate incentives, and miners might hesitate due to the high energy usage associated with maintaining the blockchain. Therefore, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize system utility while considering energy, WBAN incentives, miner revenue, and FL loss. A computationally efficient stable matching-based algorithm is proposed for optimizing utility via associating WBANs and miners. Associated WBANs use Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) to minimize computation energy. Moreover, this work integrates Differential Privacy (DP) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) mechanisms to prevent information leakage by adding noise to gradients before updating model weights and encrypting consequences before transmitting them to miners. Real-world experiments validate the framework, yielding an average of 15.1%, 9.03%, and 15.35% improvements over existing methods.

Applications dealing with intimate data, with critical results, cannot afford this risk and are termed Data-Sensitive Applications (DSA). Some examples are healthcare, finance, etc. The data required for DSA cannot be stored centrally due to large amounts, or isolated data islands. The ML and DL techniques following a data-centralized approach have difficulties in handling the scattered data frequently associated with DSA.

This motivates previously reluctant entities like banks to collaborate for variety and quantity of data. Most DSA transitioned to FL, but the migration is not without concerns. These include communication costs, heterogeneity, and malicious attacks. In this paper, we deeply analyze the role of FL in DSA and provide a taxonomy for the studies and implementations of FL.

However, due to the complex healthcare system and data privacy concerns, aggregating and utilizing these data in a centralized manner can be challenging. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for distributed training in edge computing scenarios, utilizing on-device user data while reducing server costs. In traditional FL, a central server trains a global model sampled client data randomly, and the server combines the collected model from different clients into one global model. However, for not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) datasets, randomly selecting users to train server is not an optimal choice and can lead to poor model training performance. To address this limitation, we propose the Federated Multi-Center Clustering algorithm (FedMCC) to enhance the robustness and accuracy for all clients. FedMCC leverages the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, focusing on training a robust base model during the initial training phase and better capturing features from different users. Subsequently, clustering methods are used to ensure that features among users within each cluster are similar, approximating an i.i.d. training process in each round, resulting in more effective training of the global model. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FedMCC through extensive experiments on public healthcare datasets. The results demonstrate that FedMCC achieves improved performance and accuracy for all clients while maintaining data privacy and security, showcasing its potential for various healthcare applications.

Still, the privacy and higher number of communication rounds limit the performance of the model. Hence, this research introduces the privacy-preserving EHR information sharing technique, FL, based on deep Q reinforcement learning with spectral clustering (FL+DQRE-SCnet).

The suggested solution is decentralized, allowing all participating nodes to jointly identify harmful individuals using a novel cross-check mechanism. To prevent biased assessments, the identification procedure is done blindly and is incorporated into the regular training process. A smart activation mechanism based on flag activation is also proposed to reduce the network overhead. Finally, general mathematical proofs combined with extensive experimental results applied in a healthcare electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring scenario show that the proposed techniques are very efficient at accurately predicting heart problems.

Besides, uploaded analysing parameters by patients can reveal private information and the threat of direct manipulation by the central server. To address these issues, we present a three-fold Federated Edge Aggregator, the so-called Edge Intelligence, a federated learning-based privacy protection framework for safeguarding Smart Healthcare Systems at the edge against such privacy attacks. We employ an iteration-based Conventional Neural Network (CNN) model and artificial noise functions to balance privacy protection and model performance. A theoretical convergence bound of Edge Intelligence on the trained federated learning model's loss function is also introduced here. We evaluate and compare the proposed framework with the recently established methods using model performance and privacy budget on popular and recent datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, STL10, and COVID19 chest x-ray. Finally, the proposed framework achieves 90% accuracy and a high privacy rate demonstrating better performance than the baseline technique.","This work presents a three-fold Federated Edge Aggregator, the so-called Edge Intelligence, a federated learning-based privacy protection framework for safeguarding Smart Healthcare Systems at the edge against such privacy attacks, and employs an iteration-based Conventional Neural Network model and artificial noise functions to balance privacy protection and model performance."

It requires a voluminous exchange of data for disease prediction via the open communication channel, i.e., the Internet to train artificial intelligence (AI) models efficiently and effectively. The open nature of communication channels puts data privacy at high risk and affects the model training of collected data at centralized servers. To overcome this, an emerging concept, i.e., federated learning (FL) is a viable solution. It performs training at client nodes and aggregates their results to train the global model. The concept of local training preserves the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the patient’s data which contributes effectively to the training process. The applicability of FL in the healthcare domain has various advantages, but it has not been explored to its extent. The existing surveys majorly focused on the role of FL in diverse applications, but there exists no detailed or comprehensive survey on FL in healthcare informatics (HI). We present a relative comparison of recent surveys with the proposed survey. To strengthen healthcare data privacy and increase the QoL of patients, we proposed an FL-based layered healthcare informatics architecture along with the case study on FL-based electronic health records (FL-EHR).

Traditional approaches to addressing these elements involve sharing patient data between institutions or practice settings, which can compromise data privacy (individuals’ right to prevent the sharing and disclosure of information about themselves) and data security (simultaneously preserving confidentiality, accuracy, fidelity, and availability of data). This article describes insights from real-world implementation of federated learning techniques that offer opportunities to maintain both data privacy and availability via collaborative machine learning that shares knowledge, not data. Local models are trained separately on local data. As they train, they send local model updates (e.g. coefficients or gradients) for consolidation into a global model. In some use cases, global models outperform local models on new, previously unseen local datasets, suggesting that collaborative learning from a greater number of examples, including a greater number of rare cases, may improve predictive performance. Even when sharing model updates rather than data, privacy leakage can occur when adversaries perform property or membership inference attacks which can be used to ascertain information about the training set. Emerging techniques mitigate risk from adversarial attacks, allowing investigators to maintain both data privacy and availability in collaborative healthcare research. When data heterogeneity between participating centers is high, personalized algorithms may offer greater generalizability by improving performance on data from centers with proportionately smaller training sample sizes. Properly applied, federated learning has the potential to optimize the reproducibility and performance of collaborative learning while preserving data security and privacy.","In this paper , the authors describe insights from real-world implementation of federated learning techniques that offer opportunities to maintain both data privacy and availability via collaborative machine learning that shares knowledge, not data."

Local differentially private (LDP) approaches are gaining more popularity due to stronger privacy notions and native support for data distribution compared to other differentially private (DP) solutions. However, DP approaches assume that the FL server (that aggregates the models) is honest (run the FL protocol honestly) or semi-honest (run the FL protocol honestly while also trying to learn as much information as possible). These assumptions make such approaches unrealistic and unreliable for real-world settings. Besides, in real-world industrial environments (e.g., healthcare), the distributed entities (e.g., hospitals) are already composed of locally running machine learning models (this setting is also referred to as the cross-silo setting). Existing approaches do not provide a scalable mechanism for privacy-preserving FL to be utilized under such settings, potentially with untrusted parties. This paper proposes a new local differentially private FL protocol (named LDPFL) for industrial settings. LDPFL can run in industrial settings with untrusted entities while enforcing stronger privacy guarantees than existing approaches.

To balance this contradiction, Federated Learning was proposed as a solution to train on private data without sharing it. However, many studies show that there is still the possibility of privacy leakage during the training process of federated learning. In light of this, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning scheme with homomorphic encryption(PPFLHE). Specifically, on the client side, homomorphic encryption technology is used to encrypt the training model shared by users to ensure its security and privacy. In addition, to prevent internal attacks, Access Control (AC) technology is used to confirm the user’s identity and judge whether it is trusted; on the server side, the Acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism is designed to remove the dropped or unresponsive users temporarily, which reduces the waiting delay and communication overhead, and solves the problem of user’s exiting during training. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high data utility and classification accuracy (81.53%), and low communication delay while achieving privacy preserving, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Despite the profitable usage of AI-based algorithms, these data-driven methods are facing issues such as the scarcity and privacy of user data, as well as the difficulty of institutions exchanging medical information. With insufficient data, ML is prevented from reaching its full potential, which is only possible if the database consists of the full spectrum of possible anatomies, pathologies, and input data types. To solve these issues, Federated Learning (FL) appeared as a valuable approach in the medical field, allowing patient data to stay where it is generated. Since an FL setting allows many clients to collaboratively train a model while keeping training data decentralized, it can protect privacy-sensitive medical data. However, FL is still unable to deliver all its promises and meets the more stringent requirements (e.g., latency, security) of a healthcare system based on multiple Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For example, although no data are shared among the participants by definition in FL systems, some security risks are still present and can be considered as vulnerabilities from multiple aspects. This paper sheds light upon the emerging deployment of FL, provides a broad overview of current approaches and existing challenges, and outlines several directions of future work that are relevant to solving existing problems in federated healthcare, with a particular focus on security and privacy issues.","This paper sheds light upon the emerging deployment of FL, provides a broad overview of current approaches and existing challenges, and outlines several directions of future work that are relevant to solving existing problems in federated healthcare, with a particular focus on security and privacy issues."

These shortcomings are of significant concern when employing FL in electronic devices in healthcare. To address these issues, we propose an Auditable Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (AP2FL) model tailored for electronics in healthcare settings. By leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), AP2FL ensures secure training and aggregation processes on both client and server sides, effectively mitigating data leakage risks. To manage Non-IID data within the proposed framework, we incorporate the Active Personalized Federated Learning (ActPerFL) model and Batch Normalization (BN) techniques to consolidate user updates and identify data similarities. Additionally, we introduce an auditing mechanism in AP2FL that reveals the contribution of each client to the FL process, facilitating the updating of the global model following diverse data types and distributions. In other words, it ensures the FL process’s integrity, transparency, fairness, and robustness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AP2FL model outperforms existing methods in accuracy and effectively eliminates privacy leakage.

Such intelligent algorithms are mostly based on the central computing mode, where all the user data are aggregated together in a central cloud to implement computing tasks.

Mobile wearable devices, widely adopted by hospitals and health organizations, serve as emerging sources of medical data and participate in the training of neural network models for accurate model inference. Since the medical data are privacy-sensitive and non-shareable, federated learning has been proposed to train a model across decentralized data, which involves each mobile device running a training task with its own data in parallel. However, due to the ever-increasing size and complexity of modern neural network models, it becomes inefficient, and may even infeasible, to perform training tasks on wearable devices that are resource-constrained. In this paper, we propose a FEderated Edge Learning system, FEEL, for efficient privacy-preserving mobile healthcare. Specifically, we design an edge-based training task offloading strategy to improve the training efficiency. Further, we build our system on the basis of federated learning to make use of distributed user data to improve the inference performance. In addition, during model training, we provide a differential privacy scheme to strengthen the privacy protection. A prototype system has been implemented to evaluate the training efficiency, inference performance and noise sensitivity, respectively. And the results have demonstrated that our proposal could train models in an efficient and privacy-preserving way.","A FEderated Edge Learning system, FEEL, for efficient privacy-preserving mobile healthcare by designing an edge-based training task offloading strategy to improve the training efficiency and providing a differential privacy scheme to strengthen the privacy protection."

Despite the profitable usage of AI-based algorithms, these data-driven methods are facing issues such as the scarcity and privacy of user data, as well as the difficulty of institutions exchanging medical information. With insufficient data, ML is prevented from reaching its full potential, which is only possible if the database consists of the full spectrum of possible anatomies, pathologies, and input data types. To solve these issues, Federated Learning (FL) appeared as a valuable approach in the medical field, allowing patient data to stay where it is generated. Since an FL setting allows many clients to collaboratively train a model while keeping training data decentralized, it can protect privacy-sensitive medical data. However, FL is still unable to deliver all its promises and meets the more stringent requirements (e.g., latency, security) of a healthcare system based on multiple Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For example, although no data are shared among the participants by definition in FL systems, some security risks are still present and can be considered as vulnerabilities from multiple aspects. This paper sheds light upon the emerging deployment of FL, provides a broad overview of current approaches and existing challenges, and outlines several directions of future work that are relevant to solving existing problems in federated healthcare, with a particular focus on security and privacy issues.

Existing approaches typically require updates to a training model to be transferred to a central server, potentially breaching data privacy laws unless the updates are sufficiently disguised or abstracted to prevent reconstruction of the dataset.

In FRESH, physiological data are collected from individuals by wearable devices. These data are processed by edge computing devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablet PCs) that train ML models using local data.

In this procedure, certificateless ring signature is used to hide the source of parameter updates during joint training for FL to effectively resist SIAs. In the proposed ring signature schema, an improved batch verification algorithm is designed to leverage additivity of linear operations on elliptic curves and to help reduce the computing workload of the server. Experimental results demonstrate that FRESH effectively reduces the success rate of SIAs and the batch verification method significantly improves the efficiency of signature verification.

The recent development of federated learning (FL) allows participants to collaboratively train powerful AHD models while keeping their health data private to local devices. This paper targets at addressing a critical challenge of adapting FL to train AHD models, where the participants’ health data is highly imbalanced and contains biased class distributions.

However, user data could be sensitive in nature, and training machine learning models on these data may expose sensitive information of users, violating their privacy.

Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it.

However, variations in medical practice, documentation standards, and data collection across institutions create data-view heterogeneity, where clients possess different or only partially overlapping clinical feature sets. This misalignment hinders the use of standard FL methods. Existing approaches rely on complex preprocessing and manual harmonisation, which can cause information loss, reduce data utility, limit scalability, and restrict client-specific personalisation. To address these limitations, we propose Personalised Attention-based Federated Graph Network (PAFNet), a scalable FL framework that enables meaningful parameter exchange across heterogeneous clients by mapping their distinct data-views into a shared latent space through client-specific projection layers. It then applies a personalised adaptation mechanism using trainable parameter masks, allowing each client to selectively incorporate global model parameters relevant to its own feature set. This design preserves local specificity, improves generalisation, and removes the need for heavy manual preprocessing common in existing approaches. Across CURIAL, eICU, and MIMIC-III datasets, PAFNet consistently outperformed state-of-the-art data-view heterogeneity FL baselines, demonstrating strong generalisation under substantial differences in client feature sets. By enabling effective personalisation and cross-institutional knowledge sharing without extensive harmonisation, PAFNet offers a robust and scalable solution for the federated training of clinical models in data-view heterogeneous environments.

However, sharing EMRs for research purposes presents challenges, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and the limitations of traditional centralized data-sharing models. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate federated learning with EMRs, thereby addressing these challenges.

RDs are, to this day, often not understood, and thus, patients are heavily underserved. Most RD studies are chronically underfunded, and research faces inherent difficulties in analyzing scarce data. Furthermore, the creation and analysis of representative datasets are often constrained by stringent data protection regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. This review examines the potential of federated learning (FL) as a privacy-by-design approach to training machine learning on distributed datasets while ensuring data privacy by maintaining the local patient data and only sharing model parameters, which is particularly beneficial in the context of sensitive data that cannot be collected in a centralized manner. FL enhances model accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets without compromising data privacy. This is particularly relevant in rare diseases, where heterogeneity and small sample sizes impede the development of robust models. FL further has the potential to enable the discovery of novel biomarkers, enhance patient stratification, and facilitate the development of personalized treatment plans. This review illustrates how FL can facilitate large-scale, cross-institutional collaboration, thereby enabling the development of more accurate and generalizable models for improved diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. However, challenges such as non-independently distributed data and significant computational and bandwidth requirements still need to be addressed.

However, various complex variances in the IoMT context, such as device and data heterogeneity, model complexities, and others, may degrade the performance of the traditional FL model.

The transformer model is applied to each device’s local data to capture the complex pattern from each input data. Each device uses the transformer model as a part of its local model to minimize the local loss function. To reduce the risk of over-fitting in the transformer model, a regularization term is instigated to the local loss function of the learning process.

However, as each institution collects data separately, conventional FL cannot leverage the different features depending on the institution. We proposed a personalized progressive FL (PPFL) approach that leverages client-specific features and evaluated with real-world datasets. We compared the performance of in-hospital mortality prediction between our model and conventional models based on accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). PPFL achieved an accuracy of 0.941 and AUROC of 0.948, which were higher than the scores of the local models and FedAvg algorithm. We also observed that PPFL achieved a similar performance for cancer data. We identified client-specific features that can contribute to mortality. PPFL is a personalized federated algorithm for heterogeneously distributed clients that expands the feature space for client-specific vertical feature information. ","This study proposes PPFL, a privacy-preserving federated learning method that leverages institution-specific features for healthcare data, achieving higher accuracy (0.941) and AUROC (0.948) than conventional models for in-hospital mortality prediction."

There is a risk of malicious acquisition of participants' personal data due to the fact that traditional machine learning needs users to provide data for training. Through the use of federated learning, which involves moving the training process from a central server to terminal devices, users' data may be protected. Each participant keeps their dataset local and only exchanges model updates. This research proposed an innovative proposal for the medical industry's differentiated privacy approach for overcoming these problems. When several healthcare organizations work together to develop models that use different and extensive information, clinical applications may be greatly enhanced. Thus, the Local and Centre Differential Privacy (LCDP) on clinical datasets is a feature of our proposed approach. Reason being that the training data is the primary emphasis of the local model, while the machine learning model is the primary focus of the central model. We discover that the local model and the central model are linked in a unique way, changes in the original data lead to changes in the gradient, which in turn lead to changes in the model parameters. Based on this finding, our technique is better than prior central methods since it protects the data, gradient, and model all at once by bridging the gap between the two. Our system provides better privacy protections and even higher performance than some of the best previous central methods, which is an excellent outcome of rigorous evaluation. ","This study proposes Local and Central Differential Privacy (LCDP) for federated learning in the medical industry, enhancing clinical applications by protecting data, gradients, and models simultaneously, outperforming previous central methods in terms of privacy and performance."

Nickson M. Karie","10.3390/s25165108","","Digital transformation in healthcare has introduced data privacy challenges, as hospitals struggle to protect patient information while adopting digital technologies such as AI, IoT, and cloud more rapidly than ever before. The adoption of powerful third-party Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) solutions for disease prediction has become a common practice. However, these solutions offer significant privacy risks when sensitive healthcare data are shared externally to a third-party server. This raises compliance concerns under regulations like HIPAA, GDPR, and Australia’s Privacy Act. To address these challenges, this paper explores a decentralized, privacy-preserving approach to train the models among multiple healthcare stakeholders, integrating Federated Learning (FL) with Homomorphic Encryption (HE), ensuring model parameters remain protected throughout the learning process. This paper proposes a novel Homomorphic Encryption-based Adaptive Tuning for Federated Learning (HEAT-FL) framework to select encryption parameters based on model layer sensitivity. The proposed framework leverages the CKKS scheme to encrypt model parameters on the client side before sharing. This enables secure aggregation at the central server without requiring decryption, providing an additional layer of security through model-layer-wise parameter management. The proposed adaptive encryption approach significantly improves runtime efficiency while maintaining a balanced level of security. Compared to the existing frameworks (non-adaptive) using 256-bit security settings, the proposed framework offers a 56.5% reduction in encryption time for 10 clients and 54.6% for four clients per epoch.

Smart healthcare leverages IoMT technology to improve patient diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment, providing efficient and personalized healthcare services. Privacy-preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a privacy-enhancing method that allows collaborative method training through distributed data sources while ensuring privacy protection and keeping the data decentralized. In the field of smart healthcare, PPFL enables healthcare professionals to train machine learning algorithms jointly on their corresponding datasets without sharing sensitive data, thereby maintaining confidentiality. Within this framework, anomaly detection includes detecting unusual events or patterns in healthcare data like unexpected changes or irregular vital signs in patient behaviors that can represent security breaches or potential health issues in the IoMT system. Smart healthcare systems could enhance patient care while protecting data confidentiality and individual privacy by incorporating PPFL with anomaly detection techniques. Therefore, this study develops a Privacy-preserving Federated Learning with Blockchain-based Smart Healthcare System (PPFL-BCSHS) technique in the IoMT environment. The purpose of the PPFL-BCSHS technique is to secure the IoMT devices via the detection of abnormal activities and FL concepts. Besides, BC technology can be applied for the secure transmission of medical data among the IoMT devices. The PPFL-BCSHS technique employs the FL for training the model for the identification of abnormal patterns. For anomaly detection, the PPFL-BCSHS technique follows three major processes, namely Mountain Gazelle Optimization (MGO)-based feature selection, Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), and Sandcat Swarm Optimization (SCSO)-based hyperparameter tuning. A series of simulations were implemented to examine the performance of the PPFL-BCSHS method. The empirical analysis highlighted that the PPFL-BCSHS method obtains improved security over other approaches under various measures.

Federated learning enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, the heterogeneity of clinical features among hospitals poses a challenge, leading to suboptimal performance in conventional federated learning. In response, we propose FedComDist, a personalized federated learning approach designed to maximize the use of heterogeneous features across hospitals for patient outcome prediction. Our approach incorporates a novel method for optimizing common global and distinct local parameters. We categorize input clinical features into two main groups—common and distinct—based on their presence across all hospitals and decouple the model parameters into common and distinct accordingly. The common features are used to train common global parameters, which are aggregated and optimized on the server, making them trainable across all hospitals. Meanwhile, the distinct features are used to train local parameters and optimized using the local dataset of each hospital. Our approach is evaluated on the eICU dataset, a publicly available multi-center clinical dataset, to predict patient clinical outcomes, specifically mortality and Length of Stay (LoS). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to various federated learning methods and provide enhanced privacy through parameter decoupling.","FedComDist proposes a personalized federated learning approach for patient outcome prediction using multi-center electronic medical records, incorporating a novel method for optimizing common and distinct model parameters to address heterogeneity in clinical features across hospitals."
