Benyuan Liu","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08588v1","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. DR is a primary cause of blindness in working-age people and it is estimated that 3 to 4 million people with diabetes are blinded by DR every year worldwide. Early diagnosis have been considered an effective way to mitigate such problem. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to analyze the DR images generated by the fundus camera for automatically DR diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on identifying small lesions on DR fundus images. The results from our analysis, which include the lesion category and their exact locations in the image, can be used to facilitate the determination of DR severity (indicated by DR stages). Different from traditional object detection for natural images, lesion detection for fundus images have unique challenges. Specifically, the size of a lesion instance is usually very small, compared with the original resolution of the fundus images, making them diffcult to be detected. We analyze the lesion-vs-image scale carefully and propose a large-size feature pyramid network (LFPN) to preserve more image details for mini lesion instance detection. Our method includes an effective region proposal strategy to increase the sensitivity. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to the original feature pyramid network (FPN) method and Faster RCNN."

Six different combinations of two model architectures, the Dense Convolutional Network-121 and the Residual Neural Network-50 and three image types, RGB, Green, and High Contrast, were tested to find the highest performing combination. We achieved an average validation loss of 0.17 and a max validation accuracy of 85 percent. By testing out multiple combinations, certain combinations of parameters performed better than others, though minimal variance was found overall. Green filtration was shown to perform the poorest, while amplified contrast appeared to have a negligible effect in comparison to RGB analysis. ResNet50 proved to be less of a robust model as opposed to DenseNet121."

Dmitry Spodarets","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02261v1","Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most threatening complications of diabetes that leads to permanent blindness if left untreated. One of the essential challenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success. Unfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is notoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images. Simplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of people. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself. However, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency between different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus. Additionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which makes use of similar datasets with different labeling. The presented method can be used as a screening method for early detection of diabetic retinopathy with sensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and is ranked 54 of 2943 competing methods (quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.925466) on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset (13000 images)."

We have attempted to replicate the main method in 'Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs' published in JAMA 2016; 316(22). We re-implemented the method since the source code is not available, and we used publicly available data sets. The original study used non-public fundus images from EyePACS and three hospitals in India for training. We used a different EyePACS data set from Kaggle. The original study used the benchmark data set Messidor-2 to evaluate the algorithm's performance. We used the same data set. In the original study, ophthalmologists re-graded all images for diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and image gradability. There was one diabetic retinopathy grade per image for our data sets, and we assessed image gradability ourselves. Hyper-parameter settings were not described in the original study. But some of these were later published. We were not able to replicate the original study. Our algorithm's area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the Kaggle EyePACS test set and 0.80 on Messidor-2 did not come close to the reported AUC of 0.99 in the original study. This may be caused by the use of a single grade per image, different data, or different not described hyper-parameter settings. This study shows the challenges of replicating deep learning, and the need for more replication studies to validate deep learning methods, especially for medical image analysis.

"Evaluation of Transfer Learning for Classification of: (1) Diabetic Retinopathy by Digital Fundus Photography and (2) Diabetic Macular Edema, Choroidal Neovascularization and Drusen by Optical Coherence Tomography","https://scispace.com/paper/http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04151v1","2019","Preprint","","Rony Gelman","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04151v1","Deep learning has been successfully applied to a variety of image classification tasks. There has been keen interest to apply deep learning in the medical domain, particularly specialties that heavily utilize imaging, such as ophthalmology. One issue that may hinder application of deep learning to the medical domain is the vast amount of data necessary to train deep neural networks (DNNs). Because of regulatory and privacy issues associated with medicine, and the generally proprietary nature of data in medical domains, obtaining large datasets to train DNNs is a challenge, particularly in the ophthalmology domain.
  Transfer learning is a technique developed to address the issue of applying DNNs for domains with limited data. Prior reports on transfer learning have examined custom networks to fully train or used a particular DNN for transfer learning. However, to the best of my knowledge, no work has systematically examined a suite of DNNs for transfer learning for classification of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and two key features of age-related macular degeneration. This work attempts to investigate transfer learning for classification of these ophthalmic conditions. Part I gives a condensed overview of neural networks and the DNNs under evaluation. Part II gives the reader the necessary background concerning diabetic retinopathy and prior work on classification using retinal fundus photographs. The methodology and results of transfer learning for diabetic retinopathy classification are presented, showing that transfer learning towards this domain is feasible, with promising accuracy. Part III gives an overview of diabetic macular edema, choroidal neovascularization and drusen (features associated with age-related macular degeneration), and presents results for transfer learning evaluation using optical coherence tomography to classify these entities."

We also provide novel results for five different screening and clinical grading systems for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema classification, including results for accurately classifying images according to clinical five-grade diabetic retinopathy and four-grade diabetic macular edema scales. These results suggest, that a deep learning system could increase the cost-effectiveness of screening while attaining higher than recommended performance, and that the system could be applied in clinical examinations requiring finer grading."

It is a common complication of diabetes that can impact the eyes and lead to vision loss. One method for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy is the examination of the fundus of the eye. An ophthalmologist examines the back part of the eye, including the retina, optic nerve, and the blood vessels that supply the retina. In the case of diabetic retinopathy, the blood vessels in the retina deteriorate and can lead to bleeding, swelling, and other changes that affect vision. We proposed a method for detecting diabetic diabetic severity levels. First, a set of data-prerpocessing is applied to available data: adaptive equalisation, color normalisation, Gaussian filter, removal of the optic disc and blood vessels. Second, we perform image segmentation for relevant markers and extract features from the fundus images. Third, we apply an ensemble of classifiers and we assess the trust in the system."

  Methods A deep learning framework was trained to grade the images automatically. A large representative set of 7000 color fundus images were used for the experiment which were obtained from the EyePACS that were made available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis experts were employed to categorize these images into Accept and Reject classes based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR. A deep learning framework was trained using 3428 images.
  Results A total of 3572 images were used for the evaluation of the proposed method. The method shows an accuracy of 100% to successfully categorise Accept and Reject images.
  Conclusion Image quality is an essential prerequisite for the grading of DR. In this paper we have proposed a deep learning based automated image quality assessment method in the context of DR. The method can be easily incorporated with the fundus image capturing system and thus can guide the photographer whether a recapture is necessary or not."

The study conducted a systematic literature review using the PRISMA analysis and 62 articles has been investigated in the research. By including CNN-based models for DR grading, and feature fusion several deep-learning methodologies are explored during the study. For enhancing effectiveness in classification accuracy and robustness the data augmentation and ensemble learning strategies are scrutinized. By demonstrating the superior performance compared to individual models the efficacy of ensemble learning methods is investigated. The potential ensemble approaches in DR diagnosis are shown by the integration of multiple pre-trained networks with custom classifiers that yield high specificity. The diverse deep-learning techniques that are employed for detecting DR lesions are discussed within the diabetic retinopathy lesions segmentation and detection section. By emphasizing the requirement for continued research and integration into clinical practice deep learning shows promise for personalized healthcare and early detection of diabetics."

Subtle distinction among different grades and existence of many significant small features make the task of recognition very challenging. In addition, the present approach of retinopathy detection is a very laborious and time-intensive task, which heavily relies on the skill of a physician. Automated detection of diabetic retinopathy is essential to tackle these problems. Early-stage detection of diabetic retinopathy is also very important for diagnosis, which can prevent blindness with proper treatment. In this paper, we developed a novel deep convolutional neural network, which performs the early-stage detection by identifying all microaneurysms (MAs), the first signs of DR, along with correctly assigning labels to retinal fundus images which are graded into five categories. We have tested our network on the largest publicly available Kaggle diabetic retinopathy dataset, and achieved 0.851 quadratic weighted kappa score and 0.844 AUC score, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on severity grading. In the early-stage detection, we have achieved a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of above 94%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Timely identification is critical to curb vision impairment. Algorithms for DR staging from digital fundus images (DFIs) have been recently proposed. However, models often fail to generalize due to distribution shifts between the source domain on which the model was trained and the target domain where it is deployed. A common and particularly challenging shift is often encountered when the source- and target-domain supports do not fully overlap. In this research, we introduce DRStageNet, a deep learning model designed to mitigate this challenge. We used seven publicly available datasets, comprising a total of 93,534 DFIs that cover a variety of patient demographics, ethnicities, geographic origins and comorbidities. We fine-tune DINOv2, a pretrained model of self-supervised vision transformer, and implement a multi-source domain fine-tuning strategy to enhance generalization performance. We benchmark and demonstrate the superiority of our method to two state-of-the-art benchmarks, including a recently published foundation model. We adapted the grad-rollout method to our regression task in order to provide high-resolution explainability heatmaps. The error analysis showed that 59\% of the main errors had incorrect reference labels. DRStageNet is accessible at URL [upon acceptance of the manuscript]."

Recent advances in fundus photography have precipitated the development of novel retinal imaging cameras and their subsequent implementation in clinical practice. However, most deep learning-based algorithms for DR grading demonstrate limited generalization across domains. This inferior performance stems from variance in imaging protocols and devices inducing domain shifts. We posit that declining model performance between domains arises from learning spurious correlations in the data. Incorporating do-operations from causality analysis into model architectures may mitigate this issue and improve generalizability. Specifically, a novel universal structural causal model (SCM) was proposed to analyze spurious correlations in fundus imaging.
