The treatment and management of complex chronic diseases, such as diabetes, stands to benefit from novel AI algorithms analyzing the frequent real-time streaming data and the occasional medical diagnostics and laboratory test results reported in electronic health records (EHR). Novel algorithms are needed to develop trustworthy, responsible, reliable, and robust AI techniques that can handle the imperfect and imbalanced data of EHRs and inconsistencies or discrepancies with free-living self-reported information. The challenges and applications of AI for two problems in the healthcare domain were explored in this work. First, we introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes. Then, we studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data. Application examples in the treatment of diabetes demonstrate the benefits of AI tools for medical and health informatics.","This work introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes and studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data."

We aimed to develop a method using CGM data to discover T2DM subtypes and investigate their relationship with clinical phenotypes and microvascular complications. Methods The data from 3119 patients with T2DM who wore blinded CGM at an academic medical centre was collected, and a glucose symbolic pattern (GSP) metric was created that combined knowledge‐based temporal abstraction with numerical vectorization. The k‐means clustering was applied to GSP to obtain subgroups of patients with T2DM. Clinical characteristics and the presence of diabetic retinopathy and albuminuria were compared among the subgroups. The findings were validated in an independent population comprising 773 patients with T2DM. Results By using GSP, four subgroups were identified with distinct features in CGM profiles and parameters. Moreover, the clustered subgroups differed significantly in clinical phenotypes, including indices of pancreatic β‐cell function and insulin resistance (all p &lt; .001). After adjusting for confounders, group C (the most insulin resistant) had a significantly higher risk of albuminuria (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.03‐1.39) relative to group D, which had the best glucose control. These findings were confirmed in the validation set. Conclusion Subtyping patients with T2DM using CGM data may help identify high‐risk patients for microvascular complications and provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology. This method may help refine clinically meaningful stratification of patients with T2DM and inform personalized diabetes care.

Patrick J Schumacher","10.1177/1932296820949940","","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune chronic disease characterized by absolute insulin deficiency, which causes abnormal blood glucose regulation. Currently, there are 1.25 million Americans diagnosed with T1D with approximately 64 000 new cases of T1D being diagnosed every year.1,2 There is no cure for T1D and patients with T1D rely on daily insulin administration. So, self-management of T1D is crucial to prevent or delay major complications. However, only a very small proportion of T1D patients have met the target range set by the American Diabetes Association.3 Recent years have witnessed an explosion of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled and data-empowered innovations in treating T1D patients. For instance, closedloop systems (ie, “artificial pancreas”) and insulin pumps are reported to effectively improve T1D management as well as patient outcomes. To summarize the latest research in AI-enabled T1D treatment, we conducted a literature review with PubMed and Google Scholar to retrieve publications in peer-reviewed healthcare journals from January 2019 to May 2020 (see Table 1). Overall, continuous improvements in safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and patient satisfaction using closed-loop systems to control blood glucose level in a broader T1D population (especially pediatric patients) were reported. The newest evidence was derived from various types of studies ranging from well-designed multicenter randomized clinical trial with six-month follow-up on closedloop system to comparative study between real-time and intermittent-scanning continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and to cost-effectiveness study on a hybrid closed-loop system compared with a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion system.4-6 Notably, machine learning techniques applied in CGMs were reported to lead to significant reductions in postprandial hypoglycemia, decreased rates of closed-loop exits and alerts, improved glycemic control without detectable changes in psychosocial outcomes, and accurate prediction and prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Also, the autonomous diagnostic AI system demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing referable diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Additionally, higher glycated hemoglobin level and workload required to use hybrid closed loop were suggested to be the significant factors associated with discontinuation. In a nutshell, there have been remarkable progress in AI-enabled technology in treating T1D reported in literature since 2019. Yet, practical challenges and opportunities exist. Whether the observed benefits will sustain for prolonged use in real-world settings and how AI technologies will protect patient data privacy and security are crucial questions to address. During the past few years, personalized data, machine learning (in particular, deep learning and convolutional neural network techniques), and realtime adaptive algorithms combined with wearable devices have improved prevention and early detection, clinical decision support, deterioration risk prediction, and patient self-management of T1D. Future research endeavors and technological innovations should meet patients’ needs such as mitigating user’s workload and further enhancing outcomes, optimizing data protection, and realizing patientcentered care. Unquestionably, AI, Big Data, interdisciplinary research, and global collaboration will play an increasingly important role in achieving precision medicine for T1D patients. 949940 DSTXXX10.1177/1932296820949940Journal of Diabetes Science and TechnologyQian et al letter2020","There have been remarkable progress in AI-enabled technology in treating T1D reported in literature since 2019, and whether the observed benefits will sustain for prolonged use in real-world settings is crucial questions."

However, HbA1c is subject to non-glycemic influences which confound interpretation and as a measure of average glycemia does not provide information regarding glucose trends or about the occurrence of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia episodes. As such, solitary use of HbA1c, without accompanying glucose data, does not confer actionable information that can be harnessed to guide targeted therapy in many patients with DM. While conventional capillary blood glucose monitoring (BGM) sheds light on momentary glucose levels, in practical use the inherent infrequency of measurement precludes elucidation of glycemic trends or reliable detection of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia episodes. In contrast, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data reveal glucose trends and potentially undetected hypo- and hyperglycemia patterns that can occur between discrete BGM measurements. The use of CGM has grown significantly over the past decades as an ever-expanding body of literature demonstrates a multitude of clinical benefits for people with DM. Continually improving CGM accuracy and ease of use have further fueled the widespread adoption of CGM. Furthermore, percent time in range correlates well with HbA1c, is accepted as a validated indicator of glycemia, and is associated with the risk of several DM complications.

In ophthalmology, multimodal integration through the combination of genetic and imaging data facilitates the early diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, substantial challenges remain regarding data standardization, model deployment, and model interpretability. We also highlight the future directions of multimodal integration, including its expanded disease applications, such as neurological and otolaryngological diseases, and the trend toward large-scale multimodal models, which enhance accuracy.

Although Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) sensors have been used to monitor and forecast blood glucose level, current research lacks a computational approach that recommends a behavioral intervention to bring the glucose level to a normal range. To address this shortcoming, we present GlySim1, a CGM simulator that uses multimodal data to not only forecast future glucose readings but also enable a user to examine the impacts of behavior change on glucose response in advance. GlySim creates opportunities for change in food consumption, medication, and physical activity to avoid dysglycemia by pinpointing factors that cause anomalous events using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and allowing users to observe how adjusting a behavioral factor changes glucose trajectories.

Patients have to manually check their blood sugar levels, which can be laborious and inaccurate. Many variables affect BGL changes, making accurate prediction challenging. To anticipate BGL many steps ahead, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model framework based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can be integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled diabetes management systems, improving prediction accuracy and timeliness by allowing real-time data processing on edge devices. While the GRU layer records temporal relationships and sequence information, the CNN layer analyzes the incoming data to extract significant features. Using a publicly accessible type 1 diabetes dataset, the hybrid model's performance is compared to that of the standalone Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN, and GRU models. The findings show that the hybrid CNN-GRU model performs better than the single models, indicating its potential to significantly improve real-time BGL forecasting in IoT-based diabetes management systems.

Through systematic analysis of current healthcare practices and emerging AI technologies, we examined the integration of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and intelligent monitoring systems into diabetes care for elderly populations. Based on current evidence showing up to 25% reduction in hospitalization rates and 30% increase in treatment adherence, we argue that AI integration represents a transformative approach to improving clinical outcomes in elderly diabetes care. We contend that AI-driven clinical decision support systems (CDSS) offer superior performance in risk prediction and treatment optimization, with studies demonstrating diagnostic accuracy rates of up to 93.07%, supporting our argument for their widespread implementation. Furthermore, AI-enhanced monitoring systems improved medication adherence by 17.9% compared to conventional monitoring approaches. Nonetheless, several challenges persist, including issues related to data standardization, algorithm transparency, and patient privacy protection. These results underscore the necessity of adopting a balanced implementation strategy that addresses both technical limitations and ethical considerations, while upholding patient autonomy. This perspective emphasizes the critical importance of multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, technology developers, and regulatory authorities in establishing a comprehensive framework for AI deployment in clinical settings.

NI-CGM prototypes exploiting multisensor approaches have been recently proposed to deal with physiological and environmental disturbances. In these prototypes, signals measured noninvasively (e.g., skin impedance, temperature, optical skin properties, etc.) are combined through a static multivariate linear model for estimating glucose levels.

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs augment type 1 diabetes (T1D) care based on retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. Few methods are available to estimate the likelihood of a patient experiencing clinically significant hypoglycemia within one week.


METHODS
We developed a machine learning model to estimate the probability that a patient will experience a clinically significant hypoglycemic event, defined as CGM readings below 54 mg/dL for at least 15 consecutive minutes, within one week. The model takes as input the patient's CGM time series over a given week, and outputs the predicted probability of a clinically significant hypoglycemic event the following week. We used 10-fold cross-validation and external validation (testing on cohorts different from the training cohort) to evaluate performance. We used CGM data from three different cohorts of patients with T1D: REPLACE-BG (226 patients), Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF; 355 patients) and Tidepool (120 patients).


RESULTS
In 10-fold cross-validation, the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was 0.77 (standard deviation [SD]: 0.0233) on the REPLACE-BG cohort, 0.74 (SD: 0.0188) on the JDRF cohort, and 0.76 (SD: 0.02) on the Tidepool cohort. In external validation, the average ROC-AUC across the three cohorts was 0.74 (SD: 0.0262).


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the probability of a clinically significant hypoglycemic event within one week. Predictive algorithms may provide diabetes care providers using RPM with additional context when prioritizing T1D patients for review.","A machine learning model for predicting week-ahead hypoglycemia from continuous glucose monitoring data in patients with type 1 diabetes."

As a result, two types of analytical problems arise for the retrieval and interpretation of CGM data: (1) the order and the timing of CGM readings and (2) sensor errors, time lag, and deviations from BG need to be accounted for. In order to improve the quality of information extracted from CGM data, we suggest several analytical and data visualization methods. These analyses evaluate CGM errors, assess risks associated with glucose variability, quantify glucose system stability, and predict glucose fluctuation. All analyses are illustrated with data collected using MiniMed CGMS (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) and Freestyle Navigator (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA). It is important to remember that traditional statistics do not work well with CGM data because consecutive CGM readings are highly interdependent. In conclusion, advanced analysis and visualization of CGM data allow for evaluation of dynamical characteristics of diabetes and reveal clinical information that is inaccessible via standard statistics, which do not take into account the temporal structure of data. The use of such methods has the potential to enable optimal glycemic control in diabetes and, in the future, artificial pancreas systems.","Advanced analysis and visualization of CGM data allow for evaluation of dynamical characteristics of diabetes and reveal clinical information that is inaccessible via standard statistics, which do not take into account the temporal structure of data."

We aimed to explore the fairness of current deep learning models and further create a more equitable model designed to minimize disparities in performance across groups. Methods: This study used one proprietary and two publicly available datasets, containing two-dimensional (2D) wide-angle color fundus, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus, and three-dimensional (3D) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) B-Scans, to assess deep learning models for DR detection. We developed a fair adaptive scaling (FAS) module that dynamically adjusts the significance of samples during model training for DR detection, aiming to lessen performance disparities across varied identity groups. FAS was incorporated into both 2D and 3D deep learning models to facilitate the binary classification of DR and non-DR cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was adopted to measure the model performance. Additionally, we devised an equity-scaled AUC metric that evaluates model fairness by balancing overall AUC against disparities among groups. Findings: Using in-house color fundus on the racial attribute, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating with FAS improved from 0.88 and 0.83 to 0.90 and 0.84 (p < 0.05), where the AUCs for Asians and Whites improved by 0.04 and 0.03, respectively (p < 0.01). On gender, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating with FAS both improved by 0.01 (p < 0.05). While using in-house SLO fundus on race, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating FAS improved from 0.80 to 0.83 (p < 0.01), where the AUCs for Asians, Blacks, and Whites improved by 0.02, 0.01 and 0.04, respectively (p < 0.05). On gender, FAS improved EfficientNet's overall AUC and ES-AUC both by 0.02, where the same improvement of 0.02 (p < 0.01) was gained for Females and Males. Using 3D deep learning model DenseNet121 on in-house OCT-B-Scans on race, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC from 0.875 and 0.81 to 0.884 and 0.82 respectively, where the AUCs for Asians and Blacks improved by 0.03 and 0.02 (p < 0.01).

Recently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has revolutionized fields to track real-time blood glucose levels and trends, and facilitated safe and effective decision making for diabetes management. Here, we developed an attention-based deep learning model, CGMformer, pretrained on a large-scale and diverse corpus of CGM data from a nationwide multi-center study in China to enable context-specific predictions and clinical applications to individuals. During pretraining, CGMformer gained a fundamental understanding of glucose dynamics, encoded glucose value, fluctuation pattern, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and complications using task-specific data demonstrated that CGMformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. By deciphering individual glucose dynamics, CGMformer allows us to subtype individuals with high T2D risk and identify a specific cluster of lean prediabetes that is easily overlooked by traditional glucose measurements. In particular, applied to dietary modification modelling, CGMformer predicted individual's postprandial glucose response or CGM curve, thereby provided personalized diet prescription suggestion. Overall, CGMformer represents a pretrained transformer model to decode individual glucose dynamics, from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to promote T2D early warning and recommendation for therapeutic lifestyle modification in diabetes management.

The integration of medical imaging and genetic data from extensive biobanks, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), is revolutionizing precision and smart health initiatives. In this study, we applied these principles to T2D by analyzing medical images (abdominal ultrasonography and bone density scans) alongside whole-genome single nucleotide variations in 17,785 Han Chinese participants from the Taiwan Biobank. Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing procedures were applied. Imaging analysis utilized densely connected convolutional neural networks, augmented by graph neural networks to account for intra-individual image dependencies, while genetic analysis employed Bayesian statistical learning to derive polygenic risk scores (PRS). These modalities were integrated through eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), yielding several key findings. First, pixel-based image analysis outperformed feature-centric image analysis in accuracy, automation, and cost efficiency. Second, multi-modality analysis significantly enhanced predictive accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. Third, this comprehensive approach, combining medical imaging, genetic, and demographic data, represents a promising frontier for fusion modeling, integrating AI and statistical learning techniques in disease risk assessment.

A refined clustering method that retrieves hidden information from CGM data could provide a viable method to identify patients with different degrees of dysglycemia and clinical phenotypes. Research design and methods From Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital, we selected 908 patients with type 2 diabetes (18–83 years) who wore blinded CGM sensors (iPro2, Medtronic, California, USA). Participants were clustered based on CGM data during a 24-hour period by our method. The first level extracted the knowledge-based and statistics-based features to describe CGM signals from multiple perspectives. The Fisher score and variables cluster analysis were applied to fuse features into low dimensions at the second level. The third level divided subjects into subgroups with different clinical phenotypes. The four subgroups of patients were determined by clinical phenotypes. Results Four subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes with significantly different statistical features and clinical phenotypes were identified by our method. In particular, individuals in cluster 1 were characterized by the lowest glucose level factor and glucose fluctuation factor, and the highest negative glucose factor and C peptide index. By contrast, cluster 2 had the highest glucose level factor and the lowest C peptide index. Cluster 4 was characterized by the greatest degree of glucose fluctuation factor, was the most insulin-sensitive, and had the lowest insulin resistance.

Current blood glucose monitoring (BGM) methods are often invasive and require repetitive pricking of a finger to obtain blood samples, predisposing individuals to pain, discomfort, and infection. Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring (NIBGM) is ideal for minimizing discomfort, reducing the risk of infection, and increasing convenience.


OBJECTIVE
This review aimed to map the use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) in NIBGM.


METHODS
A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the Arksey O'Malley five-step framework. Eight electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane-Central Library, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) were searched from inception until February 8, 2023. Study selection was conducted by 2 independent reviewers, descriptive analysis was conducted, and findings were presented narratively. Study characteristics (author, country, type of publication, study design, population characteristics, mean age, types of noninvasive techniques used, and application, as well as characteristics of the BGM systems) were extracted independently and cross-checked by 2 investigators. Methodological quality appraisal was conducted using the Checklist for assessment of medical AI.


RESULTS
A total of 33 papers were included, representing studies from Asia, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa published between 2005 and 2023. Most studies used optical techniques (n=19, 58%) to estimate blood glucose levels (n=27, 82%). Others used electrochemical sensors (n=4), imaging (n=2), mixed techniques (n=2), and tissue impedance (n=1). Accuracy ranged from 35.56% to 94.23% and Clarke error grid (A+B) ranged from 86.91% to 100%. The most popular machine learning algorithm used was random forest (n=10) and the most popular deep learning model was the artificial neural network (n=6). The mean overall checklist for assessment of medical AI score on the included papers was 33.5 (SD 3.09), suggesting an average of medium quality. The studies reviewed demonstrate that some AI techniques can accurately predict glucose levels from noninvasive sources while enhancing comfort and ease of use for patients. However, the overall range of accuracy was wide due to the heterogeneity of models and input data.


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts are needed to standardize and regulate the use of AI technologies in BGM, as well as develop consensus guidelines and protocols to ensure the quality and safety of AI-assisted monitoring systems. The use of AI for NIBGM is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize diabetes management.","This scoping review maps AI applications in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, finding 33 studies with varying accuracy (35.56-94.23%) and quality, highlighting the need for standardization and regulation of AI technologies in BGM."
