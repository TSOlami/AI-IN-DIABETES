Due to the sensitive nature of medical data, privacy must be considered along the entire ML pipeline, from model training to inference. In this paper, we conduct a review of recent literature concerning Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) for healthcare. We primarily focus on privacy-preserving training and inference-as-a-service, and perform a comprehensive review of existing trends, identify challenges, and discuss opportunities for future research directions. The aim of this review is to guide the development of private and efficient ML models in healthcare, with the prospects of translating research efforts into real-world settings."

This paper targets solving vertical FL in an asynchronous fashion, and develops a simple FL method. The new method allows each client to run stochastic gradient algorithms without coordination with other clients, so it is suitable for intermittent connectivity of clients. This method further uses a new technique of perturbed local embedding to ensure data privacy and improve communication efficiency. Theoretically, we present the convergence rate and privacy level of our method for strongly convex, nonconvex and even nonsmooth objectives separately. Empirically, we apply our method to FL on various image and healthcare datasets. The results compare favorably to centralized and synchronous FL methods."

Recently, federated learning provides a secure and trustable alternative to collaboratively train model without any exchange of medical data among multiple institutes. Therefore, it has draw much attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the problem. It successfully yields personalized models based on awareness of similarity between local data, and achieves better tradeoff between generalization and personalization than existing methods. After that, we further design a differentially sparse regularizer to improve communication efficiency during procedure of model training. Additionally, we propose an effective method to reduce the computational cost, which improves computation efficiency significantly. Furthermore, we collect 5 real medical datasets, including 2 public medical image datasets and 3 private multi-center clinical diagnosis datasets, and evaluate its performance by conducting nodule classification, tumor segmentation, and clinical risk prediction tasks. Comparing with 13 existing related methods, the proposed method successfully achieves the best model performance, and meanwhile up to 60% improvement of communication efficiency.

Current federated learning approaches suffer from static architectures, slow convergence (45-73 rounds), fairness gaps marginalizing smaller institutions, and scalability constraints (15-client limit). We propose Adaptive Fair Federated Learning (AFFL) through three innovations: (1) Adaptive Knowledge Messengers dynamically scaling capacity based on heterogeneity and task complexity, (2) Fairness-Aware Distillation using influence-weighted aggregation, and (3) Curriculum-Guided Acceleration reducing rounds by 60-70%. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees with epsilon-fairness bounds, achieving O(T^{-1/2}) + O(H_max/T^{3/4}) rates. Projected results show 55-75% communication reduction, 56-68% fairness improvement, 34-46% energy savings, and 100+ institution support. The framework enables multi-modal integration across imaging, genomics, EHR, and sensor data while maintaining HIPAA/GDPR compliance. We propose MedFedBench benchmark suite for standardized evaluation across six healthcare dimensions: convergence efficiency, institutional fairness, privacy preservation, multi-modal integration, scalability, and clinical deployment readiness. Economic projections indicate 400-800% ROI for rural hospitals and 15-25% performance gains for academic centers. This work presents a seven-question research agenda, 24-month implementation roadmap, and pathways toward democratizing healthcare AI."

Gian Luca Foresti","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00155v1","Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving machine learning method in which multiple clients participate in collaborative learning without sharing their data with each other and the central server. In real-world applications such as hospitals and industries, FL counters the challenges of data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity as an inevitable part of the collaborative training. More specifically, different organizations, such as hospitals, have their own private data and customized models for local training. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods do not effectively address both problems of model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity in FL. In this paper, we exploit the data and model heterogeneity simultaneously, and propose a method, MDH-FL (Exploiting Model and Data Heterogeneity in FL) to solve such problems to enhance the efficiency of the global model in FL. We use knowledge distillation and a symmetric loss to minimize the heterogeneity and its impact on the model performance. Knowledge distillation is used to solve the problem of model heterogeneity, and symmetric loss tackles with the data and label heterogeneity. We evaluate our method on the medical datasets to conform the real-world scenario of hospitals, and compare with the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the other existing methods."

FedHealth 2 obtains the client similarities via a pretrained model, and then it averages all weighted models with preserving local batch normalization.

Participating institutions might not contribute equally, some contribute more data, some better quality data or some more diverse data. To fairly rank the contribution of different institutions, Shapley value (SV) has emerged as the method of choice. Exact SV computation is impossibly expensive, especially when there are hundreds of contributors. Existing SV computation techniques use approximations. However, in healthcare where the number of contributing institutions are likely not of a colossal scale, computing exact SVs is still exorbitantly expensive, but not impossible. For such settings, we propose an efficient SV computation technique called SaFE (Shapley Value for Federated Learning using Ensembling). We empirically show that SaFE computes values that are close to exact SVs, and that it performs better than current SV approximations. This is particularly relevant in medical imaging setting where widespread heterogeneity across institutions is rampant and fast accurate data valuation is required to determine the contribution of each participant in multi-institutional collaborative learning."

Qi Dou","","https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08467v2","Federated learning (FL) allows multiple medical institutions to collaboratively learn a global model without centralizing client data. It is difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve optimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of medical images from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem becomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients outside the FL with unseen distributions not presented during federated training. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for medical imaging tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both \textit{Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL} (IOP-FL). Our inside personalization uses a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the local adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients for common knowledge and the local gradients for client-specific optimization. Moreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the global model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize an adapted model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing scheme using the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically incorporate the models, given the distribution information conveyed by the test data. Our extensive experimental results on two medical image segmentation tasks present significant improvements over SOTA methods on both inside and outside personalization, demonstrating the potential of our IOP-FL scheme for clinical practice."

However, there are two critical challenges. Firstly, user data often exists in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Secondly, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this paper, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds personalized models by transfer learning. It is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. Experiments demonstrate that FedHealth produces higher accuracy (5.3% improvement) for wearable activity recognition when compared to traditional methods. FedHealth is general and extensible and has the potential to be used in many healthcare applications."

However, additional challenges such as poor calibration and lack of interpretability may also hamper widespread deployment of federated models into clinical practice, leading to user distrust or misuse of ML tools in high-stakes clinical decision-making. In this paper, we propose to address these challenges by incorporating an adaptive conformal framework into federated learning to ensure distribution-free prediction sets that provide coverage guarantees. Importantly, these uncertainty estimates can be obtained without requiring any additional modifications to the model. Empirical results on the MedMNIST medical imaging benchmark demonstrate our federated method provides tighter coverage over local conformal predictions on 6 different medical imaging datasets for 2D and 3D multi-class classification tasks. Furthermore, we correlate class entropy with prediction set size to assess task uncertainty."

However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques."

However, practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore, the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems."

In particular, with respect to the federated aggregation procedure, researchers have been focusing on the study of secure aggregation (SA) schemes to provide privacy guarantees over the model's parameters transmitted by the clients. Nevertheless, the practical availability of SA in currently available FL frameworks is currently limited, due to computational and communication bottlenecks. To fill this gap, this study explores the implementation of SA within the open-source Fed-BioMed framework. We implement and compare two SA protocols, Joye-Libert (JL) and Low Overhead Masking (LOM), by providing extensive benchmarks in a panel of healthcare data analysis problems. Our theoretical and experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate that SA protocols effectively protect privacy while maintaining task accuracy. Computational overhead during training is less than 1% on a CPU and less than 50% on a GPU for large models, with protection phases taking less than 10 seconds. Incorporating SA into Fed-BioMed impacts task accuracy by no more than 2% compared to non-SA scenarios. Overall this study demonstrates the feasibility of SA in real-world healthcare applications and contributes in reducing the gap towards the adoption of privacy-preserving technologies in sensitive applications."

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry."

Split Learning (SL) allows a model to be trained in a split manner across different locations. Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is a more recent approach that combines the strengths of FL and SL. SplitFed minimizes the computational burden of FL by balancing computation across clients and servers, while still preserving data privacy. This makes it an ideal learning framework across various domains, especially in healthcare, where data privacy is of utmost importance. However, SplitFed networks encounter numerous communication challenges, such as latency, bandwidth constraints, synchronization overhead, and a large amount of data that needs to be transferred during the learning process. In this paper, we propose SplitFedZip -- a novel method that employs learned compression to reduce data transfer in SplitFed learning. Through experiments on medical image segmentation, we show that learned compression can provide a significant data communication reduction in SplitFed learning, while maintaining the accuracy of the final trained model.

However, the performance of FL can be constrained by the limited availability of labeled data in small institutes and the heterogeneous (i.e., non-i.i.d.) data distribution across institutes. Though data augmentation has been a proven technique to boost the generalization capabilities of conventional centralized DL as a ""free lunch"", its application in FL is largely underexplored. Notably, constrained by costly labeling, 3D medical segmentation generally relies on data augmentation. In this work, we aim to develop a vicinal feature-level data augmentation (VFDA) scheme to efficiently alleviate the local feature shift and facilitate collaborative training for privacy-aware FL segmentation. We take both the inner- and inter-institute divergence into consideration, without the need for cross-institute transfer of raw data or their mixup. Specifically, we exploit the batch-wise feature statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) in each institute to abstractly represent the discrepancy of data, and model each feature statistic probabilistically via a Gaussian prototype, with the mean corresponding to the original statistic and the variance quantifying the augmentation scope. From the vicinal risk minimization perspective, novel feature statistics can be drawn from the Gaussian distribution to fulfill augmentation. The variance is explicitly derived by the data bias in each individual institute and the underlying feature statistics characterized by all participating institutes. The added-on VFDA consistently yielded marked improvements over six advanced FL methods on both 3D brain tumor and cardiac segmentation."
