Three barriers currently constrain reliable interpretation of glucose-derived measures. The first is limited transparency: in several regulatory settings, particularly those using Conformité Européenne marking, clinical-study reports, reference-method information and analytical documentation required for market authorisation are not publicly accessible. The second barrier is heterogeneity in study procedures. Existing evaluations use different reference-glucose methods, sampling strategies, glucose-manipulation protocols and participant characteristics, leading to accuracy estimates that cannot be interpreted consistently across systems. The third barrier is calibration alignment. Even with full transparency and aligned procedures, CGM systems may differ because their calibration algorithms are trained on distinct reference-glucose datasets, influencing reported glucose ranges, automated insulin-delivery behaviour and interpretation during device transitions. A modified Delphi process involving clinicians, laboratory scientists, and researchers identified these issues as the principal determinants of comparability. During this process, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine released a validated framework for performance evaluation of CGM systems, providing a unified approach to reference-method selection, dynamic in-clinic testing, and structured reporting. Adoption would reduce procedural variability but does not resolve calibration-alignment differences. This international clinical opinion proposes a pathway towards internationally interpretable CGM evaluation: immediate transparency of clinical evidence, routine declaration of calibration alignment, and progressive adoption of validated standardised procedures. These steps provide a foundation for reliable interpretation and globally comparable assessment of CGM technologies."

Effective management of T1D greatly benefits from constant monitoring of BG levels, achievable in real-time using minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. These devices provide data streams that can be leveraged by forecasting algorithms to predict BG levels minutes in advance, enabling timely therapeutic interventions to prevent adverse events, such as hypo/hyperglycemia. With the increasing availability of data, deep learning (DL) algorithms have emerged as the state-of-the-art for BG forecasting, owing to their ability to autonomously learn complex nonlinear relationships, such as those underlying the glucoregulatory system. Despite a growing body of research, a comprehensive review specifically focusing on DL applications for BG prediction is still lacking. To address this gap, a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, involving extensive searches across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. A total of 26 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria and were evaluated based on dataset characteristics, model inputs, training paradigm, prediction horizon, model architecture, evaluation metrics, performance, and baseline comparators. While DL models show great promise, several challenges persist-particularly in ensuring physiological fidelity and interpretability, both essential for clinical adoption. To overcome these barriers, future research should prioritize the integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve model reliability and safety, ultimately supporting the effective deployment of DL models in real-time T1D management."

In this article, we focus on this practice, which is fully aligned with the NIH's Gold Standard Science (GSS) program as well as FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and TRUST (transparency, responsibility, user focus, sustainability, technology) principles. Gold Standard Science supports open science by emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and the use of best practices that enable others to verify and extend research. Pairing a research article's cited data snapshot with a versioned, environment-specific code release, deposited in a companion code repository, ensures that, upon submission to a medical journal, readers and reviewers can directly verify results. An executable and updatable companion code repository complements, rather than replaces, established research data repositories. When code underlying medical research results is made openly available, then other scientists can inspect, run, and validate analyses. These activities enhance reproducibility, which is a core aim of GSS. Shared code also facilitates collaborative innovation by allowing researchers to extend the utility of the code to new datasets and applications. For researchers, code sharing can increase visibility, credibility, and citation impact. Demonstrating transparency through shared executable and updatable code builds trust with journal readers, peer reviewers, funders, and peers. Shared code in an open access repository signals adherence to high standards of scientific integrity and attracts opportunities for collaboration. A researcher who shares code receives recognition as a leader in reproducible, trustworthy research consistent with NIH's GSS principles."

Traditional solutions separate glucose detection and insulin delivery, which is less efficient compared to emerging closed-loop wearable systems controlled by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGM-controlled systems raise new safety risks, as false CGMs readings can cause insulin overdose, which results in hypoglycemia and fatal consequences. This work proposes a concept of a dual closed-loop insulin delivery system (DuoLoop) to mitigate the risk issue of CGM-controlled systems. The first closed-loop is automated insulin delivery controlled by CGM. The second closed-loop is the controlled release of glucose-responsive insulin (GRI), whose release rate depends on actual glucose levels. A customized algorithm is trained and embedded into the wearable CGMs for edge computing. The DuoLoop system shows improved safety in preliminary in vivo test (longer normoglycemia durations, 98.82% vs 92.10%), encouraging its deployment toward precision diabetes care."

The latest International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas (2025) reports that 11.1% of the adult population (20 to 79 years old) is living with diabetes, with over 4 in 10 unaware of their condition. Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes reduce the risk and slow the progression of debilitating complications, such as amputation, vision loss, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, dementia, some cancers, and infections like tuberculosis and severe COVID-19. Current screening methods for diabetes are invasive and costly. This has limited their utilization, especially in high-density populations and low- and middle-income countries such as Indonesia. Blood Glucose Evaluation and Monitoring (BGEM) is a machine learning algorithm developed by Actxa to analyze photoplethysmography data from wearable devices for diabetic risk assessment. Its noninvasive and user-friendly nature makes it a strong candidate for fulfilling the need for a diabetes screening or monitoring tool."

We developed a multimodal ensemble approach that leverages transformer architectures to capture complex dependencies in heterogeneous healthcare data and Diffusion Models to address class imbalances by generating synthetic samples. Our research utilized diverse data sources, including electronic health records, medical imaging, and wearable device time-series data, supplemented with synthetic samples to better represent minority populations such as patients with type 1 and gestational diabetes. Critical biomarkers, including C-peptide, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c, were incorporated to improve model interpretability. The methodology involved extensive evaluation using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1-score, with cross-validation to mitigate overfitting. We also implemented interpretability features to provide clinicians with insight into the significance of biomarkers. Results showed a 6.2% improvement in minority class recall when pharmaceutical biomarkers were combined with diffusion-based augmentation. The model demonstrated enhanced classification stability and provided clear insights into clinical decision-making, highlighting the influence of biomarkers on disease progression and treatment outcomes. Future work will focus on multicenter validation, integration of additional omics data, and specialized validation across diverse populations. These findings underscore the potential of AI-driven biomarker analysis for advancing early diagnosis and personalized diabetes management, with broader implications for chronic disease prediction."
