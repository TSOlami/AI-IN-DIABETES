A shortage of diabetes specialists, uneven distribution of medical resources, low adherence to medications, and improper self-management contribute to poor glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Recent advancements in digital health technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), provide a significant opportunity to achieve better efficiency in diabetes care, which may diminish the increase in diabetes-related health-care expenditures. Here, we review the recent progress in the application of AI in the management of diabetes and then discuss the opportunities and challenges of AI application in clinical practice. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of combining and expanding upon existing digital health technologies to develop an AI-assisted digital health-care ecosystem that includes the prevention and management of diabetes.

However, there are challenges in translating diagnostic performance and its application when deployed in real-world conditions. This study aimed to assess the technical feasibility of integration and diagnostic performance of validated DR screening (DRS) AI algorithms in real-world outpatient public health settings. Prior to integrating an AI algorithm for DR screening, the study involved several steps: (1) Five AI companies, including four from India and one international company, were invited to evaluate their diagnostic performance using low-cost nonmydriatic fundus cameras in public health settings; (2) The AI algorithms were prospectively validated on fundus images from 250 people with diabetes mellitus, captured by a trained optometrist in public health settings in Chandigarh Tricity in North India. The performance evaluation used diagnostic metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, compared to human grader assessments; (3) The AI algorithm with better diagnostic performance was integrated into a low-cost screening camera deployed at a community health center (CHC) in the Moga district of Punjab, India. For AI algorithm analysis, a trained health system optometrist captured nonmydriatic images of 343 patients. Three web-based AI screening companies agreed to participate, while one declined and one chose to withdraw due to low specificity identified during the interim analysis. The three AI algorithms demonstrated variable diagnostic performance, with sensitivity (60%-80%) and specificity (14%-96%). Upon integration, the better-performing algorithm AI-3 (sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 96, and accuracy: 88·43%) demonstrated high sensitivity of image gradability (99.5%), DR detection (99.6%), and referral DR (79%) at the CHC. This study highlights the importance of systematic AI validation for responsible clinical integration, demonstrating the potential of DRS to improve health care access in resource-limited public health settings.

Objective To evaluate the performance of Medios AI (Remidio), a proprietary, offline, smartphone-based, automated system of analysis of retinal images, to detect referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) in images taken by a minimally trained health care worker with Remidio Non-Mydriatic Fundus on Phone, a smartphone-based, nonmydriatic retinal camera. Referable diabetic retinopathy is defined as any retinopathy more severe than mild diabetic retinopathy, with or without diabetic macular edema. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective, cross-sectional, population-based study took place from August 2018 to September 2018. Patients with diabetes mellitus who visited various dispensaries administered by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai in Mumbai, India, on a particular day were included. Interventions Three fields of the fundus (the posterior pole, nasal, and temporal fields) were photographed. The images were analyzed by an ophthalmologist and the AI system. Main Outcomes and Measures To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the offline automated analysis system in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy on images taken on the smartphone-based, nonmydriatic retinal imaging system by a health worker. Results Of 255 patients seen in the dispensaries, 231 patients (90.6%) consented to diabetic retinopathy screening. The major reasons for not participating were unwillingness to wait for screening and the blurring of vision that would occur after dilation. Images from 18 patients were deemed ungradable by the ophthalmologist and hence were excluded. In the remaining participants (110 female patients [51.6%] and 103 male patients [48.4%]; mean [SD] age, 53.1 [10.3] years), the sensitivity and specificity of the offline AI system in diagnosing referable diabetic retinopathy were 100.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-100.0%) and 88.4% (95% CI, 83.2%-92.5%), respectively, and in diagnosing any diabetic retinopathy were 85.2% (95% CI, 66.3%-95.8%) and 92.0% (95% CI, 97.1%-95.4%), respectively, compared with ophthalmologist grading using the same images. Conclusions and Relevance These pilot study results show promise in the use of an offline AI system in community screening for referable diabetic retinopathy with a smartphone-based fundus camera. The use of AI would enable screening for referable diabetic retinopathy in remote areas where services of an ophthalmologist are unavailable. This study was done on patients with diabetes who were visiting a dispensary that provides curative services to the population at the primary level. A study with a larger sample size may be needed to extend the results to general population screening, however."

Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. Methods We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. Findings A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8·1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0·973 (95% CI 0·969–0·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92·25% (90·10–94·12) and specificity of 89·04% (87·85–90·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99·42% (99·15–99·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97·19% (96·61–97·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

The study consisted of two components: (1) DR screening of patients using an AI-assisted system and (2) in-depth interviews with health professionals involved in implementing screening. Participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus attending two endocrinology outpatient and three Aboriginal Medical Services clinics between March 2018 and May 2019 were invited to a prospective observational study. A single 45-degree (macula centred), non-stereoscopic, colour retinal image was taken of each eye from participants and were instantly screened for referable DR using a custom offline automated AI system. A total of 236 participants, including 174 from endocrinology and 62 from Aboriginal Medical Services clinics, provided informed consent and 203 (86.0%) were included in the analysis. A total of 33 consenting participants (14%) were excluded from the primary analysis due to ungradable or missing images from small pupils (n = 21, 63.6%), cataract (n = 7, 21.2%), poor fixation (n = 2, 6.1%), technical issues (n = 2, 6.1%), and corneal scarring (n = 1, 3%). The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI system for referable DR were 0.92, 96.9% and 87.7%, respectively. There were 51 disagreements between the reference standard and index test diagnoses, including 29 which were manually graded as ungradable, 21 false positives, and one false negative. A total of 28 participants (11.9%) were referred for follow-up based on new ocular findings, among whom, 15 (53.6%) were able to be contacted and 9 (60%) adhered to referral. Of 207 participants who completed a satisfaction questionnaire, 93.7% specified they were either satisfied or extremely satisfied, and 93.2% specified they would be likely or extremely likely to use this service again. Clinical staff involved in screening most frequently noted that the AI system was easy to use, and the real-time diagnostic report was useful. Our study indicates that AI-assisted DR screening model is accurate and well-accepted by patients and clinicians in endocrinology and indigenous healthcare settings. Future deployments of AI-assisted screening models would require consideration of downstream referral pathways."

With regard to research, disparities in funding and infrastructure between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are discussed. The under-representation of LMIC populations in clinical trials, challenges in conducting large-scale research projects, and the ethical and legal complexities of artificial intelligence integration are also considered as specific issues. The development of global research networks and strategies for improved training, standardisation of data and enhanced accessibility to big data analytics to drive innovation and personalised medicine are recommended. With regard to diabetes care, inequalities in access to essential medications, particularly insulin and novel therapies, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure are discussed. Proposed initiatives include international support programmes, improved healthcare provider training and the inclusion of newer diabetes medications in essential drug lists. The importance of global screening programmes, a universal diabetes education curriculum and standardised healthcare checklists is also emphasised. Regarding healthcare organisation, the development of national diabetes registers, benchmarking performance across regions and strengthening international collaborations are highly advised. The role of diabetes specialists as care coordinators and the need for structured assessments to improve early intervention and long-term outcomes are also discussed. Ultimately, the EASD Global Council urges action for a unified, global approach to diabetes research and care to bridge the gap between scientific innovation and clinical practice, ensuring equitable healthcare worldwide.

This pivotal trial of an AI system to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in people with diabetes enrolled 900 subjects, with no history of DR at primary care clinics, by comparing to Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center (FPRC) widefield stereoscopic photography and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), by FPRC certified photographers, and FPRC grading of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale (ETDRS) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). More than mild DR (mtmDR) was defined as ETDRS level 35 or higher, and/or DME, in at least one eye. AI system operators underwent a standardized training protocol before study start. Median age was 59 years (range, 22-84 years); among participants, 47.5% of participants were male; 16.1% were Hispanic, 83.3% not Hispanic; 28.6% African American and 63.4% were not; 198 (23.8%) had mtmDR. The AI system exceeded all pre-specified superiority endpoints at sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI, 81.8-91.2%) (>85%), specificity of 90.7% (95% CI, 88.3-92.7%) (>82.5%), and imageability rate of 96.1% (95% CI, 94.6-97.3%), demonstrating AI's ability to bring specialty-level diagnostics to primary care settings. Based on these results, FDA authorized the system for use by health care providers to detect more than mild DR and diabetic macular edema, making it, the first FDA authorized autonomous AI diagnostic system in any field of medicine, with the potential to help prevent vision loss in thousands of people with diabetes annually.

Objective To describe the performance of an AI system for diabetic retinopathy deployed in a primary care practice. Design, Setting, and Participants Diagnostic study of patients with diabetes seen at a primary care practice with 4 physicians in Western Australia between December 1, 2016, and May 31, 2017. A total of 193 patients consented for the study and had retinal photographs taken of their eyes. Three hundred eighty-six images were evaluated by both the AI-based system and an ophthalmologist. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity and specificity of the AI system compared with the gold standard of ophthalmologist evaluation. Results Of the 193 patients (93 [48%] female; mean [SD] age, 55 [17] years [range, 18-87 years]), the AI system judged 17 as having diabetic retinopathy of sufficient severity to require referral. The system correctly identified 2 patients with true disease and misclassified 15 as having disease (false-positives). The resulting specificity was 92% (95% CI, 87%-96%), and the positive predictive value was 12% (95% CI, 8%-18%). Many false-positives were driven by inadequate image quality (eg, dirty lens) and sheen reflections. Conclusions and Relevance The results demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of using AI systems to identify diabetic retinopathy in clinical practice. Key challenges include the low incidence rate of disease and the related high false-positive rate as well as poor image quality. Further evaluations of AI systems in primary care are needed."

Existing methodological approaches and research insights are evaluated. An understanding of existing gaps and future directions is created. Over the past decades, artificial intelligence has emerged into the scientific consciousness with breakthroughs that are sparking increasing interest among computer science and medical communities. Specifically, machine learning and deep learning (a subtype of machine learning) applications of artificial intelligence are spreading into areas that previously were thought to be only the purview of humans, and a number of applications in ophthalmology field have been explored. Multiple studies all around the world have demonstrated that such systems can behave on par with clinical experts with robust diagnostic performance in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. However, only few tools have been evaluated in clinical prospective studies. Given the rapid and impressive progress of artificial intelligence technologies, the implementation of deep learning systems into routinely practiced diabetic retinopathy screening could represent a cost-effective alternative to help reduce the incidence of preventable blindness around the world."

Mean (SD) participant age was 53.9 (15.2) years (median, 56; range, 18-88 years), 655 were White (73.3%), and 206 had type 1 diabetes (23.1%). Sensitivity and specificity of the AI system were high in detecting mtmDR (sensitivity: 95.5%; 95% CI, 92.4%-98.5% and specificity: 85.0%; 95% CI, 82.6%-87.4%) and vtDR (sensitivity: 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.1%-100% and specificity: 89.0%; 95% CI, 87.0%-91.1%) without dilation. Imageability was high without dilation, with the AI system able to grade 87.4% (95% CI, 85.2%-89.6%) of the eyes with reading center grades. When eyes with ungradable results were dilated per the protocol, the imageability improved to 97.4% (95% CI, 96.4%-98.5%), with the sensitivity and specificity being similar. After correcting for enrichment, the mtmDR specificity increased to 87.8% (95% CI, 86.3%-89.5%) and the sensitivity remained similar; for vtDR, both sensitivity (97.0%; 95% CI, 91.2%-100%) and specificity (90.1%; 95% CI, 89.4%-91.5%) improved. Conclusions and Relevance This prospective multicenter cross-sectional diagnostic study noted safety and accuracy with use of the EyeArt Automated DR Detection System in detecting both mtmDR and, for the first time, vtDR, without physician assistance. These findings suggest that improved access to accurate, reliable diabetic eye examinations may increase adherence to recommended annual screenings and allow for accelerated referral of patients identified as having vtDR."

Major advances in diagnostics, technology and treatment have already revolutionized how we manage DR in the early part of the 21st century. For example, the accessibility of imaging with optical coherence tomography, and the development of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment are just some of the landmark developments that have shaped the DR landscape over the last few decades. Yet, there are still more exciting advances being made. Looking forward to 2030, many of these ongoing developments are likely to further transform the field. First, epidemiologic projections show that the global burden of DR is not only increasing, but also shifting from high-income countries towards middle- and low-income areas. Second, better understanding of disease pathophysiology is placing greater emphasis on retinal neural dysfunction and non-vascular aspects of diabetic retinal disease. Third, a wealth of information is becoming available from newer imaging modalities such as widefield imaging systems and optical coherence tomography angiography. Fourth, artificial intelligence for screening, diagnosis and prognostication of DR will become increasingly accessible and important. Fifth, new pharmacologic agents targeting other non-VEGF-driven pathways, and novel therapeutic strategies such as gene therapy are being developed for DR. Finally, the classification system for diabetic retinal disease will need to be continually updated to keep pace with new developments. In this article, we discuss these major trends in DR that we expect to see in 2030 and beyond."

We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without human assessment. Methods In this economic analysis modelling study, using 39 006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and TreeAge Pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the results to key model assumptions. Findings From the health system perspective, the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, at US$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to the Singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model are estimated to be $489 000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual screening cost. By 2050, Singapore is projected to have 1 million people with diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million. Interpretation This study provides a strong economic rationale for using deep learning systems as an assistive tool to screen for diabetic retinopathy. Funding Ministry of Health, Singapore."

Adults with diabetes were recruited from two urban endocrinology outpatient clinics and single-field, non-mydriatic fundus photographs were taken and graded for referable DR ( ≥ pre-proliferative DR). Each participant underwent; (1) automated screening model; where a deep learning algorithm (DLA) provided real-time reporting of results; and (2) manual model where retinal images were transferred to a retinal grading centre and manual grading outcomes were distributed to the patient within 2 weeks of assessment. Participants completed a questionnaire on the day of examination and 1-month following assessment to determine overall satisfaction and the preferred model of care. In total, 96 participants were screened for DR and the mean assessment time for automated screening was 6.9 minutes. Ninety-six percent of participants reported that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the automated screening model and 78% reported that they preferred the automated model over manual. The sensitivity and specificity of the DLA for correct referral was 92.3% and 93.7%, respectively. AI-based DR screening in endocrinology outpatient settings appears to be feasible and well accepted by patients."
