Many factors can cause a person to get affected by diabetes, like excessive body weight, abnormal cholesterol level, family history, physical inactivity, bad food habit etc. Increased urination is one of the most common symptoms of this disease. People with diabetes for a long time can get several complications like heart disorder, kidney disease, nerve damage, diabetic retinopathy etc. But its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early. In this paper, an automatic diabetes prediction system has been developed using a private dataset of female patients in Bangladesh and various machine learning techniques. The authors used the Pima Indian diabetes dataset and collected additional samples from 203 individuals from a local textile factory in Bangladesh. Feature selection algorithm mutual information has been applied in this work. A semi-supervised model with extreme gradient boosting has been utilized to predict the insulin features of the private dataset. SMOTE and ADASYN approaches have been employed to manage the class imbalance problem. The authors used machine learning classification methods, that is, decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and various ensemble techniques, to determine which algorithm produces the best prediction results. After training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The explainable AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to understand how the model predicts the final results. Finally, a website framework and an Android smartphone application have been developed to input various features and predict diabetes instantaneously. The private dataset of female Bangladeshi patients and programming codes are available at the following link: https://github.com/tansin-nabil/Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning."

To improve the quality of the transfer between multiple sources of data, we propose a multi-source adversarial transfer learning framework that enables the learning of a feature representation that is similar across the sources, and thus more general and more easily transferable We apply this idea to glucose forecasting for diabetic people using a fully convolutional neural network The evaluation is done by exploring various transfer scenarios with three datasets characterized by their high inter and intra variability 
While transferring knowledge is beneficial in general, we show that the statistical and clinical accuracies can be further improved by using of the adversarial training methodology, surpassing the current state-of-the-art results In particular, it shines when using data from different datasets, or when there is too little data in an intra-dataset situation To understand the behavior of the models, we analyze the learnt feature representations and propose a new metric in this regard Contrary to a standard transfer, the adversarial transfer does not discriminate the patients and datasets, helping the learning of a more general feature representation 
The adversarial training framework improves the learning of a general feature representation in a multi-source environment, enhancing the knowledge transfer to an unseen target 
The proposed method can help improve the efficiency of data shared by different health actors in the training of deep models"

Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture VGG16 was employed for this study. A transfer learning process was implemented to re-train the CNN for robust OCTA classification. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of using this method for artificial intelligence (AI) screening of DR in clinical environments, the re-trained CNN was incorporated into a custom developed GUI platform which can be readily operated by ophthalmic personnel. Results: With last nine layers re-trained, CNN architecture achieved the best performance for automated OCTA classification. The overall accuracy of the re-trained classifier for differentiating healthy, NoDR, and NPDR was 87.27%, with 83.76% sensitivity and 90.82% specificity. The AUC metrics for binary classification of healthy, NoDR and DR were 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The GUI platform enabled easy validation of the method for AI screening of DR in a clinical environment. Conclusion: With a transfer leaning process to adopt the early layers for simple feature analysis and to re-train the upper layers for fine feature analysis, the CNN architecture VGG16 can be used for robust OCTA classification of healthy, NoDR, and NPDR eyes. Translational Relevance: OCTA can capture microvascular changes in early DR. A transfer learning process enables robust implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated OCTA classification of DR."

Some of them include the fact that the disease displays a non-uniform pattern, where patients present different symptoms; the requirement of highly qualified specialists to interpret the images of the fundus; the risk of errors in the interpretation of images or their inconsistency; and the absence of clear morphological signs often makes early diagnosis unlikely. Traditional diagnosis mostly rely on the expert interpretation of retinal images, which can lead to bias and inaccuracy; highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods. Although traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods enhance the diagnostic capabilities remarkably, their black box nature and information opacity restrict healthcare providers to comprehend the reasoning framework of the AI to build trust and optimize its usage in practice. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging approach that addresses the black-box problem by improving the interpretability of models, which allows users to understand the logic behind certain decisions. This research proposed a diagnosis model for detecting diabetic retinopathy using XAI approaches that increases the interpretability of the models to help clinicians understand the reasons behind the decisions. The proposed model is used to enhance diagnostic accuracy, offer comprehensible, and concise insights regarding the diagnostics. The convergence history plots of the proposed model validate the learning process to achieve 94% better diagnostic accuracy than traditional methods while improving interpretability and applicability in healthcare settings, indicating improvement in accuracy and loss reduction."

Among these applications, the use of AI in healthcare, particularly in the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases like diabetes, has shown significant promise. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), with its minimally invasive and resource-efficient approach, promotes sustainability in healthcare by streamlining the process of predictive model creation. This research paper delves into advancements in AutoML for predictive modeling in diabetes diagnosis. It illuminates their effectiveness in identifying risk factors, optimizing treatment strategies, and ultimately improving patient outcomes while reducing environmental footprint and conserving resources. The primary objective of this scholarly inquiry is to meticulously identify the multitude of factors contributing to the development of diabetes and refine the prediction model to incorporate these insights. This process fosters a comprehensive understanding of the disease in a manner that supports the principles of sustainable healthcare. By analyzing the provided dataset, AutoML was able to select the most fitting model, emphasizing the paramount importance of variables such as Glucose, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and BloodPressure in determining an individual’s diabetic status. The sustainability of this process lies in its potential to expedite treatment, reduce unnecessary testing and procedures, and ultimately foster healthier lives. Recognizing the importance of accuracy in this critical domain, we propose that supplementary factors and data be rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the assessment. This approach aims to devise a model with enhanced accuracy, further contributing to the efficiency and sustainability of healthcare practices."

Despite the potential of bias to propagate health disparities, racial bias in clinical ML has yet to be thoroughly examined and best practices for bias mitigation remain unclear. Objective Our objective was to perform a scoping review to characterize the methods by which the racial bias of ML has been assessed and describe strategies that may be used to enhance algorithmic fairness in clinical ML. Methods A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases, as well as Google Scholar, identified 635 records, of which 12 studies were included. Results Applications of ML were varied and involved diagnosis, outcome prediction, and clinical score prediction performed on data sets including images, diagnostic studies, clinical text, and clinical variables. Of the 12 studies, 1 (8%) described a model in routine clinical use, 2 (17%) examined prospectively validated clinical models, and the remaining 9 (75%) described internally validated models. In addition, 8 (67%) studies concluded that racial bias was present, 2 (17%) concluded that it was not, and 2 (17%) assessed the implementation of bias mitigation strategies without comparison to a baseline model. Fairness metrics used to assess algorithmic racial bias were inconsistent. The most commonly observed metrics were equal opportunity difference (5/12, 42%), accuracy (4/12, 25%), and disparate impact (2/12, 17%). All 8 (67%) studies that implemented methods for mitigation of racial bias successfully increased fairness, as measured by the authors’ chosen metrics. Preprocessing methods of bias mitigation were most commonly used across all studies that implemented them. Conclusions The broad scope of medical ML applications and potential patient harms demand an increased emphasis on evaluation and mitigation of racial bias in clinical ML. However, the adoption of algorithmic fairness principles in medicine remains inconsistent and is limited by poor data availability and ML model reporting. We recommend that researchers and journal editors emphasize standardized reporting and data availability in medical ML studies to improve transparency and facilitate evaluation for racial bias."

Developing robust AI models for DR classification holds substantial potential, but a key challenge is ensuring their generalization in unfamiliar domains with varying data distributions. To address this, our paper investigates cross-domain generalization, also known as domain generalization (DG), within the context of DR classification. DG, a challenging problem in the medical domain, is complicated by the difficulty of gathering labeled data across different domains, such as patient demographics and disease stages. Some recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using CLIP to handle the DG problem in natural images. In this study, we investigate CLIP's transfer learning capabilities and its potential for cross-domain generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We carry out comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy and potential of CLIP in addressing DG for DR classification. Further, we introduce a multi-modal fine-tuning strategy named Context Optimization with Learnable Visual Tokens (CoOpLVT), which enhances context optimization by conditioning on visual features. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method increases the F1-score by 1.8% over the baseline, thus underlining its promise for effective DG in DR classification. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Sanoojan/CLIP-DRDG. "

The number of diabetic patients will increase to 552 million by 2034, as per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Aim With advances in computer science techniques, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), opportunities for the detection of DR at the early stages have increased. This increase means that the chances of recovery will increase and the possibility of vision loss in patients will be reduced in the future. Methods In this paper, deep transfer learning models for medical DR detection were investigated. The DL models were trained and tested over the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 dataset. According to literature surveys, this research is considered one the first studies to use of the APTOS 2019 dataset, as it was freshly published in the second quarter of 2019. The selected deep transfer models in this research were AlexNet, Res-Net18, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, and VGG19. These models were selected, as they consist of a small number of layers when compared to larger models, such as DenseNet and InceptionResNet. Data augmentation techniques were used to render the models more robust and to overcome the overfitting problem. Results The testing accuracy and performance metrics, such as the precision, recall, and F1 score, were calculated to prove the robustness of the selected models. The AlexNet model achieved the highest testing accuracy at 97.9%. In addition, the achieved performance metrics strengthened our achieved results. Moreover, AlexNet has a minimum number of layers, which decreases the training time and the computational complexity."

In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI ‘black-box’ algorithms.

Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. …","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant cause of vision impairment, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and timely intervention to avert visual deterioration. Diagnosing DR is inherently complex, as it necessitates the meticulous examination of intricate retinal images by experienced specialists. This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing. Remarkably, the DiaCNN model showcased unparalleled precision, achieving 100% accuracy in training and 98.3% in testing. These figures represent a significant leap in classification accuracy when juxtaposed with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Such advancements hold immense promise for the future, emphasizing the potential of our proposed technique to revolutionize the accuracy of DR and other eye disease diagnoses. By facilitating earlier detection and more timely interventions, this approach stands poised to significantly reduce the incidence of blindness associated with DR, thus heralding a new era of improved patient outcomes. Therefore, this work, through its novel approach and stellar results, not only pushes the boundaries of DR diagnostic accuracy but also promises a transformative impact in early detection and intervention, aiming to substantially diminish DR-induced blindness and champion enhanced patient care.
