Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Conclusion GlucoNet‐MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy‐aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

A scoping review of 40 studies by Mohsen et al. shows that while most studies used unimodal AI models, multimodal approaches were superior because they integrate multiple types of data. However, creating multimodal models and determining model performance are challenging tasks given the multi-factored nature of diabetes. For both unimodal and multimodal models, there are also concerns of bias with the lack of external validations and representation of race, age, and gender in training data. The barriers in data quality and evaluation standardization are ripe areas for developing new technologies, especially for entrepreneurs and innovators.

T2D is a widely common chronic disease that its roots and progression patterns are not fully understood. Predicting the progression of T2D can inform timely and more effective interventions to prevent or manage the disease. In this study, we have used a dataset related to 63 patients with T2D that includes the data from two different types of wearable devices worn by the patients: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and activity trackers (ActiGraphs). Using this dataset, we created a model for predicting the levels of four major biomarkers related to T2D after a one-year period. We developed a wide and deep neural network and used the data from the demographic information, lab tests, and wearable sensors to create the model. The deep part of our method was developed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to process the time-series dataset collected by the wearables.

Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population.

However, with extensive glycemic variability, developing a prediction algorithm applicable across diverse populations remains a significant challenge. Leveraging meta-learning for domain generalization, we propose GPFormer, a Transformer-based zero-shot learning method designed for multi-horizon glucose prediction. We developed GPFormer on the REPLACE-BG dataset, comprising 226 participants with T1D, and proceeded to evaluate its performance using three external clinical datasets with CGM data.

These four datasets include both outpatient and inpatient settings, various intervention strategies, and demographic variability, which effectively reflect real-world scenarios of CGM usage. When compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods, GPFormer consistently demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest root mean square error for all the evaluated datasets up to a prediction horizon of two hours. These experimental results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed model across a variety of populations, demonstrating its substantial potential to enhance glucose management in a wide range of practical clinical settings.

Early and precise foretelling of DM remains a decisive factor for timely intervention, thereby mitigating severe downstream sequelae such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Conventional prognostic frameworks typically depend on exclusively either structured tabular measurements or visual medical imagery, which constrains comprehensive diagnostic capacity. This contribution confronts such limitation by advancing a hybrid machine learning (ML) methodology that synergistically combines deep learning—specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dedicated to retinal photograph scrutiny—with gradient-boosting machines (GBMs) that ingest structured demographic and clinical variables. Two publicly accessible repositories supplied training material: the Pima Indians Diabetes Database for tabular covariates and the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS 2019) Blindness Detection corpus for fundus imagery. Retinal studies underwent standardised pre-processing re-scaling, pixel normalisation, Gaussian denoising, and multiplicative augmentation while tabular patient records underwent rigorous feature ranking. Outcome representations from both data strata were concatenated into a consolidated tensor, thereby rendering simultaneous latent-space learning achievable. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms single-modality models, achieving an accuracy of 96%, a macro average F1 score of 0.96, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.994. The proposed approach offers a comprehensive diagnostic framework by combining systemic and localized disease indicators, thereby enhancing robustness, reducing variance, and supporting more informed clinical decision-making. This work highlights the potential of multimodal ML integration for complex disease prediction and sets the stage for future extensions to other chronic conditions.

Through the incorporation of evidence from AI-enabled models, the research projects predictive accuracies exceeding 80% in the onset and progression of illness and their role in ensuring early diagnosis, customized treatment, and operational efficiency. Inventions like neural networks improved by particle swarm optimization attain diagnostic accuracies of 99.67%, while edge computing helps real-time monitoring to reduce hospitalizations through early interventions. Although AI in health care has advanced significantly, algorithmic biases against underrepresented populations—e.g., older adults and non-White communities—fragmented data ecosystems preventing institutional interoperability, and ethical issues regarding privacy and transparency continue to impede scalability and fair implementation. To overcome these obstacles and ensure innovations are distributed equitably across global health care systems, future initiatives should prioritize multimodal data fusion, fairness audits during model development, federated learning frameworks that support safe cross-institutional collaboration, and large clinical trials that validate AI in multiple real-world settings.

We aimed to explore the fairness of current deep learning models and further create a more equitable model designed to minimize disparities in performance across groups. Methods: This study used one proprietary and two publicly available datasets, containing two-dimensional (2D) wide-angle color fundus, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus, and three-dimensional (3D) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) B-Scans, to assess deep learning models for DR detection. We developed a fair adaptive scaling (FAS) module that dynamically adjusts the significance of samples during model training for DR detection, aiming to lessen performance disparities across varied identity groups. FAS was incorporated into both 2D and 3D deep learning models to facilitate the binary classification of DR and non-DR cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was adopted to measure the model performance. Additionally, we devised an equity-scaled AUC metric that evaluates model fairness by balancing overall AUC against disparities among groups. Findings: Using in-house color fundus on the racial attribute, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating with FAS improved from 0.88 and 0.83 to 0.90 and 0.84 (p < 0.05), where the AUCs for Asians and Whites improved by 0.04 and 0.03, respectively (p < 0.01). On gender, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating with FAS both improved by 0.01 (p < 0.05). While using in-house SLO fundus on race, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating FAS improved from 0.80 to 0.83 (p < 0.01), where the AUCs for Asians, Blacks, and Whites improved by 0.02, 0.01 and 0.04, respectively (p < 0.05). On gender, FAS improved EfficientNet's overall AUC and ES-AUC both by 0.02, where the same improvement of 0.02 (p < 0.01) was gained for Females and Males. Using 3D deep learning model DenseNet121 on in-house OCT-B-Scans on race, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC from 0.875 and 0.81 to 0.884 and 0.82 respectively, where the AUCs for Asians and Blacks improved by 0.03 and 0.02 (p < 0.01). On gender, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC of DenseNet121 by 0.04 and 0.03, whereas the AUCs for Females and Males improved by 0.05 and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively. Interpretation: Existing deep learning models indeed exhibit variable performance across diverse identity groups in DR detection.

Potential healthcare disparities can happen when machine learning models, used in diabetes technologies, are trained on data from primarily White patients. We aimed to evaluate algorithmic fairness in glucose predictions. This study utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 101 White and 104 Black participants with type 1 diabetes collected by the JAEB Center for Health Research, US. Long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models were trained on 11 datasets of different proportions of White and Black participants and tailored to each individual using transfer learning to predict glucose 60 minutes ahead based on 60-minute windows. Root mean squared errors (RMSE) were calculated for each participant. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the association between racial composition and RMSE while accounting for age, sex, and training data size. A median of 9 weeks (IQR: 7, 10) of CGM data was available per participant. The divergence in performance (RMSE slope by proportion) was not statistically significant for either group. However, the slope difference (from 0% White and 100% Black to 100% White and 0% Black) between groups was statistically significant (p=0.02), meaning the RMSE increased 0.04 [0.01, 0.08] mmol/L more for Black participants compared to White participants when the proportion of White participants increased from 0 to 100% in the training data. This difference was attenuated in the transfer learned models (RMSE: 0.02 [-0.01, 0.05] mmol/L, p=0.20). The racial composition of training data created a small statistically significant difference in the performance of the models, which was not present after using transfer learning. This demonstrates the importance of diversity in datasets and the potential value of transfer learning for developing more fair prediction models.

However, a critical gap exists around understanding the reproducibility of state-of-the-art methods for blood glucose prediction. In this study, we curated 60 deep learning (DL)-based glucose prediction papers published between 2018–2025 and assessed them against seven established reproducibility criteria. We found that code availability, overreliance on a single public dataset, and limited use of multiple datasets for algorithm development and evaluation are amongst the top challenges to reproducibility. Next, we replicated six representative models from well-cited prior literature using 4602 days of data with over 1.25 million glucose samples from 128 persons with type 1 diabetes across three public datasets - OhioT1DM, DiaTrend, and T1DEXI. Our results show good reproducibility of DL methods when using the same code (where available) and same evaluation dataset. However, we found poor conceptual reproducibility across datasets with significantly different diabetes management. Further analyses revealed that the accuracy of blood glucose prediction methods was significantly associated with individual diabetes management and sex/gender. All models had significantly higher prediction errors for individuals with worse glycemic control and for female subgroups compared to males. To accelerate development of robust and equitable algorithms for diabetes management, we conclude with recommendations for future researchers centered considerations for data selection, model design and selection, model evaluation and reporting results, documentation and code release.

This is likely to be more important in real-world scenarios, as data is not collected under strict research protocol.

While deep learning prediction accuracy surpassed the widely-used mathematical simulator approach, the model deteriorated in safety critical scenarios and struggled to leverage self-reported meal and exercise information. SHAP value analysis also indicated the model had fundamentally confused the roles of insulin and carbohydrates, which is one of the most basic T1D management principles.

Genomic information is used to discover heritable risk factors or features applied in precision medicine to guide treatment decisions. This information is fixed in time for any individual. By contrast, periodically updated medical records and especially the use of real-time health-sensing devices provide accurate tracking of health and disease over time. The technological trend toward enabling consumer electronics with capabilities for sensing physiological signals, such as motion, heart rate, or blood sugar levels, is creating a vast data space. If properly processed, these real-time data can fundamentally change research paradigms and transform the clinical practice.However, more data are not always better. With the increased data volume and complexity, the challenge becomes how to extract information relevant to the condition of a particular patient at a particular time. The classic pathway of medical logic of data → information → decision becomes difficult to follow with the traditional methods of biostatistics. New approaches are needed and are fortunately available, ranging from modeling, simulation, and optimal control methods, to rapidly developing data science tools.Before continuing further, we should emphasize that, arguably, diabetes mellitus is the best quantified human condition. In the past 40 years, metabolic monitoring technologies have progressed from occasional assessment of average glycemia via glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), to blood glucose monitoring a few times a day, to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) producing data points every few minutes—time series tracking the dynamics of the metabolic system. The high temporal resolution of CGM data has enabled advanced treatments such as decision support assisting insulin injection or oral medication, or automated closed-loop control known as the ""artificial pancreas."" Sophisticated metabolic models and simulators are available as well.In this article, we review the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We structured the results of this review in three sections: (1) closed-loop control, or automated insulin delivery (AID), which appears to be the term preferred recently; (2) decision-support systems (DSS), particularly those that use contemporary methods such as artificial intelligence, and (3) data acquisition, engineering, analytics, and visualization, which are all data science tools increasingly applied to the retrieval of electronic medical records (EMR) and real-time disease-tracking information.Key Articles ReviewedConsensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M, Nimri R, Bergenstal RM, Barnard-Kelly K, Danne T, Hovorka R, Kovatchev BP, Messer LH, Parkin CG, Ambler-Osborn L, Amiel SA, Bally L, Beck RW, Biester S, Biester T, Blanchette JE, Bosi E, Boughton CK, Breton MD, Brown SA, Buckingham BA, Cai A, Carlson AL, Castle JR, Choudhary P, Close KL, Cobelli C, Criego AB, Davis E, de Beaufort C, de Bock MI, DeSalvo DJ, DeVries JH, Dovc K, Doyle FJ 3rd, Ekhlaspour L, Shvalb NF, Forlenza GP, Gallen G, Garg SK, Gershenoff DC, Gonder-Frederick LA, Haidar A, Hartnell S, Heinemann L, Heller S, Hirsch IB, Hood KK, Isaacs D, Klonoff DC, Kordonouri O, Kowalski A, Laffel L, Lawton J, Lal RA, Leelarathna L, Maahs DM, Murphy HR, Nørgaard K, O'Neal D, Oser S, Oser T, Renard E, Riddell MC, Rodbard D, Russell SJ, Schatz DA, Shah VN, Sherr JL, Simonson GD, Wadwa RP, Ward C, Weinzimer SA, Wilmot EG, Battelino TEndoc Rev2023;

8:e47592Closed-Loop Control of Diabetes, or AIDA PubMed search on artificial pancreas, or AID, or closed loop in diabetes identified 397 results for the period of July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. From these, we selected 40 articles of interest (e.g., ∼10%) for inclusion in the reference list of this article. Five of these articles are reviewed in more detail in the following pages (1–5). It is worth noting that four of them are published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (impact factor, 176.082) (2–5) and signify substantial clinical trials by different research groups. Publication of these studies in such high-ranking journals was rare until recently, and we believe the AID literature this past year has achieved a new record in terms of its impact on medical science.A number of other notable studies were published as well (6–15) that tested various AID systems in diverse conditions, such as the inpatient setting (7), with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (9,10), with long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D) with hypoglycemia unawareness (12), or in very young children (14). The large randomized trials (> 100 participants) used traditional designs to reconfirm the advantages of hybrid closed loop over conventional therapy (6,15). Meta-analyses (16–18) and comprehensive reviews (19–23) solidified AID as an advanced, effective, and cost-effective (24) treatment of T1D and T2D. International consortiums published clinical guidelines for the use of AID in the clinical practice (1,25–27). And several studies reported real-life data for various AID systems (28–35), with one study reporting data for nearly 20,000 AID users (28).The investigation of using ultra-rapid-acting insulin has continued with clinical trials comparing faster insulin aspart with standard insulin aspart (36–38) and yielding mixed results—in some studies no effect was shown (36), in others ultra-rapid insulin contributed to better control (38). A new study using a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor in addition to insulin in people with T1D confirmed previous results and found that ""empagliflozin at 2.5 and 5 mg increased time in range during hybrid closed-loop therapy by 11–13 percentage points compared with placebo in those who otherwise were unable to attain glycemic targets"" (39). And last, but not least, a study on AID performance during swimming was published, which also presents interesting data about the interdevice (sensor–pump) communication in water (40).Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M1,2*, Nimri R1,2*, Bergenstal RM3, Barnard-Kelly K4, Danne T5, Hovorka R6, Kovatchev BP7, Messer LH8, Parkin CG9, Ambler-Osborn L10, Amiel SA11, Bally L12, Beck RW13, Biester S5, Biester T5, Blanchette JE14,15, Bosi E16, Boughton CK17, Breton MD7, Brown SA7,18, Buckingham BA19, Cai A20, Carlson AL3, Castle JR21, Choudhary P22, Close KL20, Cobelli C23, Criego AB3, Davis E24, de Beaufort C25, de Bock MI26, DeSalvo DJ27, DeVries JH28, Dovc K29, Doyle FJ 3rd30, Ekhlaspour L31, Shvalb NF1, Forlenza GP8, Gallen G11, Garg SK8, Gershenoff DC3, Gonder-Frederick LA7, Haidar A32, Hartnell S33, Heinemann L34, Heller S35, Hirsch IB36, Hood KK37, Isaacs D38, Klonoff DC39, Kordonouri O5, Kowalski A40, Laffel L10, Lawton J41, Lal RA42, Leelarathna L43, Maahs DM19, Murphy HR44, Nørgaard K45, O'Neal D46, Oser S47, Oser T47, Renard E48, Riddell MC49, Rodbard D50, Russell SJ51, Schatz DA52, Shah VN8, Sherr JL53, Simonson GD3, Wadwa RP8, Ward C54, Weinzimer SA53, Wilmot EG55,56, Battelino T29*Contributed equally to the manuscript and are both corresponding authors 1The Jesse Z and Sara Lea Shafer Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center for Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel; 2Sacker Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; 3International Diabetes Center, HealthPartners Institute, Minneapolis, MN; 4Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK; 5AUF DER BULT, Diabetes-Center for Children and Adolescents, Endocrinology and General Paediatrics, Hannover, Germany; 6Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; 7Center for Diabetes Technology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 8Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver—Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 9CGParkin Communications, Inc., Henderson, NV; 10Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; 11Department of Diabetes, King's College London, London, UK; 12Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 13Jaeb Center for Health Research Foundation, Inc., Tampa, FL; 14College of Nursing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; 15Center for Diabetes and Obesity, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; 16Diabetes Research Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital and San Raffaele Vita Salute University, Milan, Italy; 17Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Cambridge, UK; 18Division of Endocrinology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 19Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 20The diaTribe Foundation/Close Concerns, San Diego, CA; 21Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; 22Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; 23Department of Woman and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; 24Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Australia; 25Diabetes & Endocrine Care Clinique Pédiatrique DECCP/Centre Hospitalier Luxembourg, and Faculty of Sciences, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzette, GD Luxembourg/Department of Paediatrics, UZ-VUB, Brussels, Belgium; 26Department of Paediatrics, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand; 27Division of Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX ; 28Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Internal Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 29Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, UMC - University Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; 30Harvard John A.

Numerous randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have shown that the use of AID systems is safe and effective in helping individuals with diabetes achieve long-term glycemic goals while reducing hypoglycemia risk. AID systems have thus become an integral part of diabetes management, but recommendations for using AID systems in clinical settings have been lacking.MethodsIn 2021, an international panel of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in AID was organized by the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress to develop clinical guidelines for initiating AID for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The nine working groups addressed evolution of AID, clinical evidence, determining the target population for AID use, initiation of AID, education and training, utilization of AID, AID data reporting, psychological issues/user perspective, and the future of AID. The full panel voted on the working group recommendations, which became the basis of the consensus recommendations.ResultsThe report provides needed guidance to clinicians who are interested in using AID and (2) serves as a comprehensive review of evidence for payers to consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage.ConclusionsGuided recommendations are critical for AID success and acceptance, and all clinicians who treat diabetes need to become familiar with the available systems to eliminate disparities in diabetes quality of care. A comprehensive listing of the evidence payers should consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage is also provided.CommentsThese consensus recommendations published in Endocrine Reviews present the collective opinion of a select group of experts in AID (aka closed-loop control of diabetes) regarding the use of AID systems in clinical practice. This article is a highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to be introduced to the current technological and clinical state of AID systems, with a peek into their future as well.Following a review of the closed-loop field and an account of the evidence-based advantages of AID systems over other T1D therapies, the guidelines continue with sections explaining the different types of AID algorithms and the difference between hybrid and fully automated AID systems (HCL and FCL), the latter being defined as an AID system that does not require user involvement to function.The following are major takeaways from these consensus recommendations. (1) Evidence suggests that AID systems should be considered as a treatment option for all people with T1D to improve glycemic control, regardless of age, hypoglycemia awareness, pregnancy, or certain comorbidities. (2) To date, all clinically available systems are ""hybrid,"" meaning they require specific diabetes managements skills such as carbohydrate counting, so training and support for users and health-care providers are essential. (3) Interoperability between system components (e.g., sensors, algorithms, and insulin pumps) is important for the proliferation of these new technologies, but to a large extent this depends on the industry. (4) Early initiation of diabetes technologies in newly diagnosed T1D has been shown to improve and sustain long-term glycemic control, so early AID system initiation is encouraged. (5) The transition to an AID system should be individualized, and the initial settings of an AID system should be selected according to personal glycemic targets, based on recently acquired continuous glucose monitor (CGM) metrics. (6) Unified reporting of AID data is suggested, using clinically important glucose (e.g., time-in-range) and insulin (e.g., total daily insulin) metrics, plus the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) usually aggregated over 14 days, which has become a standardized way to visualize CGM data. (7) Psychological issues related to the use of AID systems should be discussed and documented in the context of discontinuation or noncompliance with AID treatment.In conclusion, the consensus recommendations map future directions for AID development, including FCL, use of data science methods to analyze and comprehend the vast amounts of CGM and insulin-delivery data collected by AID systems, and learning adaptive AID algorithms that continually tailor the treatment to the changing behavior and physiology of their users. The consensus strongly recommends that all payers (government and private) should reimburse for AID systems as well as for AID education and training to support the management of people with T1D.Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery in Type 1 DiabetesBurnside MJ1,3, Lewis DM11, Crocket HR4, Meier RA1, Williman JA2, Sanders OJ1,3, Jefferies CA6,7, Faherty AM6, Paul RG5, Lever CS5, Price SKJ5, Frewen CM8, Jones SD8, Gunn TC10, Lampey C6, Wheeler BJ8,9, de Bock MI1,31Departments of Pediatrics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 2Department of Population Health, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 3Department of Pediatrics, Canterbury District Health Board Christchurch, New Zealand; 4Te Huataki Waiora School of Health, Sport and Human Performance, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; 5Waikato Regional Diabetes Service, Waikato District Health Board, Hamilton, New Zealand; 6Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Starship Children's Health, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 7Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 8Department of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 9Pediatric Department, Southern District Health Board, Dunedin, New Zealand; 10Nightscout New Zealand, Hamilton, New Zealand; 11OpenAPS, Seattle, WAN Engl J Med 2022;387:869–881This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) use open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, and more data are needed on the efficacy and safety of these system.MethodsIn this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, patients with T1D were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use an open-source AID system or a sensor-augmented insulin pump (control). The participants included both children (defined as 7–15 years of age) and adults (defined as 16–70 years of age). A modified version of AndroidAPS 2.8 (with a standard OpenAPS 0.7.0 algorithm) paired with a preproduction DANA-i insulin pump and Dexcom G6 CGM, which has an Android smartphone application as the user interface, was used as the AID system. The primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) between days 155 and 168, the final 2 weeks of the trial.ResultsA total of 97 patients (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization, 44 to open-source AID and 53 to the control group. At 24 weeks, the mean time in the target range increased from 61.2% ± 12.3% SD to 71.2% ± 12.1% SD in the AID group and decreased from 57.7% ± 14.3% SD to 54.5% ± 16.0% SD in the control group (adjusted difference, 14 percentage points [95% CI, 9.2–18.8], P < 0.001), with no treatment effect according to age (P = 0.56). Participants in the AID group spent 3 hours and 21 minutes more in the target range per day compared with in the control group. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in either group. Two patients in the AID group withdrew from the trial owing to connectivity issues.ConclusionsThe use of an open-source AID system in children and adults with T1D resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time in the target glucose range compared with the use of a sensor-augmented insulin pump.CommentsOpen-source AID (or Do-it-yourself Loop) algorithms have been available since before commercial AID systems appeared on the market. Typically, the handling of these open-source algorithms required above-average engineering and computer skills. The lack of clinical trials of open-source AID was also a reason these systems to remain unregulated (i.e., not formally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] or other regulatory agencies). This article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine aims to counter these shortcomings by presenting a randomized-controlled trial of one open-source algorithm running on a smartphone.The trial achieved results that are very similar to those in trials published to date for commercial AID systems: for instance, a 14-percentage-point increase in time in range up to 71%, a reduction of HbA1c of 0.5 percentage points, and a relatively low risk for hypoglycemia. The editorial that accompanied the article labeled the trial a ""path toward expanding treatment options for diabetes"" (41). As expected there were opposing opinions that emphasized the lack of regulatory approval of open-source AID: ""Unapproved products and algorithms raise the undesirable prospect of clinical harm and litigation"" (42). After the publication of this article, the latter argument became less critical owing to the FDA approval in January 2023 of Tidepool Loop—an FDA-regulated version of Loop, to be available in the iOS App Store, which is intended to work with commercially available insulin pumps and CGMs.This ATTD Yearbook article takes a neutral view on the open-source AID controversy: evidence has shown that these systems are not superior to commercial devices, and their more flexible customization features do not necessarily result in improved glycemic control. However, as noted in the previously mentioned editorial (41), open-source AID offers one more path toward expanding the treatment options for insulin-requiring diabetes, which can be appealing to a perhaps select group of people who are confident in their diabetes-management skills.Trial of Hybrid Closed-Loop Control in Young Children with Type 1 DiabetesWadwa RP1, Reed ZW2, Buckingham BA3, DeBoer MD5, Ekhlaspour L4, Forlenza GP1, Schoelwer M5, Lum J2, Kollman C2, Beck RW2, Breton MD5, for the PEDAP Trial Study Group1Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 2Jaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, FL; 3Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 4Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University of California, San Francisco, CA; 5University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology, Charlottesville, VAN Engl J Med 2023;388:991–1001This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.Closed-loop control systems of insulin delivery may improve glycemic outcomes in young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the efficacy and safety of initiating a closed-loop s ","This article reviews the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 2022 to June 2023, focusing on closed-loop control, artificial intelligence-based decision-support systems, and data science.

So kann KI Stimmmerkmale, Daten der Genetik und der Bildgebung präventiv zur individuellen Diabetesrisikostratifizierung nutzen. Durch eine Kombination von multimodalen Daten und Fundusbildern ermöglicht sie eine frühzeitige Diagnose diabetesbedingter Komplikationen wie Retino‑, Nephro- oder Neuropathie. Bereits heute können KI-basierte Systeme die Diabetestherapie durch eine personalisierte Ernährungsanalyse, automatisierte Kohlenhydratschätzung, Medikamentenwahl und Insulindosierung unterstützen. Insbesondere in Verbindung mit CGM- (kontinuierliche Glukosemessung) oder AID-Systemen (AID: automatisierte Insulindosierung) wird der klinische Nutzen KI-basierter Entscheidungsunterstützungslösungen mit Verbesserung der glykämischen Kontrolle und Förderung der Adhärenz offensichtlich. Zudem ist KI mit Hilfe von Wearables oder gar im Fahrzeugcockpit in der Lage, Hypoglykämien prädiktiv zu erkennen und so Notfallsituationen oder Verkehrsunfälle zu verhindern.

Methods: Between June 2018 and March 2022, adults with T1D with incident DR or no retinopathy (control) were identified. The CGM data were collected retrospectively for up to seven years before the date of defining incident DR or no retinopathy. A mixture of three machine learning algorithms was trained and evaluated in two different scenarios, using different glycemic features extracted from CGM traces (scenario 1), and the two principal components (two PCs; exposure to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia risk) of those features (scenario 2). Classifiers were evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC) to select the best classification model.

Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL ( p &lt; 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support. These results indicate that the ARISES has great potential to mitigate the risk of severe complications and enhance self-management for people with T1D.

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs augment type 1 diabetes (T1D) care based on retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. Few methods are available to estimate the likelihood of a patient experiencing clinically significant hypoglycemia within one week.


METHODS
We developed a machine learning model to estimate the probability that a patient will experience a clinically significant hypoglycemic event, defined as CGM readings below 54 mg/dL for at least 15 consecutive minutes, within one week. The model takes as input the patient's CGM time series over a given week, and outputs the predicted probability of a clinically significant hypoglycemic event the following week. We used 10-fold cross-validation and external validation (testing on cohorts different from the training cohort) to evaluate performance. We used CGM data from three different cohorts of patients with T1D: REPLACE-BG (226 patients), Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF; 355 patients) and Tidepool (120 patients).


RESULTS
In 10-fold cross-validation, the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was 0.77 (standard deviation [SD]: 0.0233) on the REPLACE-BG cohort, 0.74 (SD: 0.0188) on the JDRF cohort, and 0.76 (SD: 0.02) on the Tidepool cohort. In external validation, the average ROC-AUC across the three cohorts was 0.74 (SD: 0.0262).


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the probability of a clinically significant hypoglycemic event within one week.

Here, to bridge the gaps, we developed an integrated image–language system (DeepDR-LLM), combining a large language model (LLM module) and image-based deep learning (DeepDR-Transformer), to provide individualized diabetes management recommendations to PCPs. In a retrospective evaluation, the LLM module demonstrated comparable performance to PCPs and endocrinology residents when tested in English and outperformed PCPs and had comparable performance to endocrinology residents in Chinese. For identifying referable DR, the average PCP’s accuracy was 81.0% unassisted and 92.3% assisted by DeepDR-Transformer. Furthermore, we performed a single-center real-world prospective study, deploying DeepDR-LLM. We compared diabetes management adherence of patients under the unassisted PCP arm ( n = 397) with those under the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm ( n = 372). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm showed better self-management behaviors throughout follow-up ( P &lt; 0.05). For patients with referral DR, those in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm were more likely to adhere to DR referrals ( P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, DeepDR-LLM deployment improved the quality and empathy level of management recommendations. Given its multifaceted performance, DeepDR-LLM holds promise as a digital solution for enhancing primary diabetes care and DR screening.

While significant efforts have been made to develop algorithms that assist PwT1D in managing blood glucose more effectively, access to automated insulin delivery (AID) systems remains highly variable across the world. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets necessary for developing algorithms to support scenarios where AID systems revert to manual mode. This study addresses this gap by providing a detailed, multimodal dataset encompassing five key aspects: blood glucose levels; basal and bolus insulin dosages; nutritional intake (carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fibre content); physical activity (step count, active calories, distance covered, MET, and intensity level); and sleep patterns. The dataset includes longitudinal (3-month) real-world data collected from 17 PwT1D participants. By making this resource available, the study aims to advance algorithm development and improve diabetes management, particularly in settings where AID technology is less accessible.

Potential healthcare disparities can happen when machine learning models, used in diabetes technologies, are trained on data from primarily White patients. We aimed to evaluate algorithmic fairness in glucose predictions. This study utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 101 White and 104 Black participants with type 1 diabetes collected by the JAEB Center for Health Research, US. Long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models were trained on 11 datasets of different proportions of White and Black participants and tailored to each individual using transfer learning to predict glucose 60 minutes ahead based on 60-minute windows. Root mean squared errors (RMSE) were calculated for each participant. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the association between racial composition and RMSE while accounting for age, sex, and training data size. A median of 9 weeks (IQR: 7, 10) of CGM data was available per participant. The divergence in performance (RMSE slope by proportion) was not statistically significant for either group. However, the slope difference (from 0% White and 100% Black to 100% White and 0% Black) between groups was statistically significant (p = 0.02), meaning the RMSE increased 0.04 [0.01, 0.08] mmol/L more for Black participants compared to White participants when the proportion of White participants increased from 0 to 100% in the training data. This difference was attenuated in the transfer learned models (RMSE: 0.02 [-0.01, 0.05] mmol/L, p = 0.20). The racial composition of training data created a small statistically significant difference in the performance of the models, which was not present after using transfer learning. This demonstrates the importance of diversity in datasets and the potential value of transfer learning for developing more fair prediction models.

However, most deep learning models are considered black-boxes; hence, the model predictions are not interpretable and may not offer actionable insights into medical practitioners’ decisions. Previous work has shown that counterfactual explanations can be applied in forecasting tasks by suggesting counterfactual changes in time series inputs to achieve the desired forecasting outcome. This study proposes a generalized multivariate forecasting setup of counterfactual generation by introducing a novel approach, COMET, which imposes three domain-specific constraint mechanisms to provide counterfactual explanations for glucose forecasting. Moreover, we conduct the experimental evaluation using two diabetes patient datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating realistic counterfactual changes in comparison with a baseline approach. Our qualitative analysis evaluates examples to validate that the counterfactual samples are clinically relevant and can effectively lead the patients to achieve a normal range of predicted glucose levels by suggesting changes to the treatment variables.","This study proposes a generalized multivariate forecasting setup of counterfactual generation by introducing a novel approach, COMET, which imposes three domain-specific constraint mechanisms to provide counterfactual explanations for glucose forecasting."

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements. These results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D. The well-trained models can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts.

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.","This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field."

This approach provides a multidimensional perspective of patient health that enhances the diagnosis, treatment, and management of various medical conditions. This viewpoint presents an overview of the current state of multimodal integration in health care, spanning clinical applications, current challenges, and future directions. We focus primarily on its applications across different disease domains, particularly in oncology and ophthalmology. Other diseases are briefly discussed due to the few available literature. In oncology, the integration of multimodal data enables more precise tumor characterization and personalized treatment plans. Multimodal fusion demonstrates accurate prediction of anti–human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy response (area under the curve=0.91). In ophthalmology, multimodal integration through the combination of genetic and imaging data facilitates the early diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, substantial challenges remain regarding data standardization, model deployment, and model interpretability. We also highlight the future directions of multimodal integration, including its expanded disease applications, such as neurological and otolaryngological diseases, and the trend toward large-scale multimodal models, which enhance accuracy.

Recently, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has revolutionized fields to track real-time blood glucose levels and trends, and facilitated safe and effective decision making for diabetes management. Here, we developed an attention-based deep learning model, CGMformer, pretrained on a large-scale and diverse corpus of CGM data from a nationwide multi-center study in China to enable context-specific predictions and clinical applications to individuals. During pretraining, CGMformer gained a fundamental understanding of glucose dynamics, encoded glucose value, fluctuation pattern, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and complications using task-specific data demonstrated that CGMformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. By deciphering individual glucose dynamics, CGMformer allows us to subtype individuals with high T2D risk and identify a specific cluster of lean prediabetes that is easily overlooked by traditional glucose measurements. In particular, applied to dietary modification modelling, CGMformer predicted individual's postprandial glucose response or CGM curve, thereby provided personalized diet prescription suggestion. Overall, CGMformer represents a pretrained transformer model to decode individual glucose dynamics, from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to promote T2D early warning and recommendation for therapeutic lifestyle modification in diabetes management.

The integration of medical imaging and genetic data from extensive biobanks, driven by artificial intelligence (AI), is revolutionizing precision and smart health initiatives. In this study, we applied these principles to T2D by analyzing medical images (abdominal ultrasonography and bone density scans) alongside whole-genome single nucleotide variations in 17,785 Han Chinese participants from the Taiwan Biobank. Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing procedures were applied. Imaging analysis utilized densely connected convolutional neural networks, augmented by graph neural networks to account for intra-individual image dependencies, while genetic analysis employed Bayesian statistical learning to derive polygenic risk scores (PRS). These modalities were integrated through eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), yielding several key findings. First, pixel-based image analysis outperformed feature-centric image analysis in accuracy, automation, and cost efficiency. Second, multi-modality analysis significantly enhanced predictive accuracy compared to single-modality approaches. Third, this comprehensive approach, combining medical imaging, genetic, and demographic data, represents a promising frontier for fusion modeling, integrating AI and statistical learning techniques in disease risk assessment.

DM impacted 463 million individuals worldwide in 2019, with over four million fatalities documented. Blood glucose levels (BGL) are usually measured, as standard protocols, through invasive procedures. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques have demonstrated the potential to estimate BGL using data collected by non-invasive Wearable Devices (WDs), thereby, facilitating monitoring and management of diabetics. One of the key aspects of WDs with machine learning (ML) algorithms is to find specific data signatures, called Digital biomarkers, that can be used in classification or gaging the extent of the underlying condition. The use of such biomarkers to monitor glycemic events represents a major shift in technology for self-monitoring and developing digital biomarkers using non-invasive WDs. To do this, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between characteristics acquired from non-invasive WDs and indicators of glycemic health; furthermore, much work is needed to validate accuracy. The study aimed to investigate performance of AI models in estimating BGL among diabetic patients using non-invasive wearable devices data An open-source dataset was used which provided BGL readings, diabetic status (Diabetic or non-diabetic), heart rate, Blood oxygen level (SPO2), Diastolic Blood pressure, Systolic Blood Pressure, Body temperature, Sweating, and Shivering for 13 participants by age group taken from WDs.

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements.

A refined clustering method that retrieves hidden information from CGM data could provide a viable method to identify patients with different degrees of dysglycemia and clinical phenotypes. Research design and methods From Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital, we selected 908 patients with type 2 diabetes (18–83 years) who wore blinded CGM sensors (iPro2, Medtronic, California, USA). Participants were clustered based on CGM data during a 24-hour period by our method. The first level extracted the knowledge-based and statistics-based features to describe CGM signals from multiple perspectives. The Fisher score and variables cluster analysis were applied to fuse features into low dimensions at the second level. The third level divided subjects into subgroups with different clinical phenotypes. The four subgroups of patients were determined by clinical phenotypes. Results Four subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes with significantly different statistical features and clinical phenotypes were identified by our method. In particular, individuals in cluster 1 were characterized by the lowest glucose level factor and glucose fluctuation factor, and the highest negative glucose factor and C peptide index. By contrast, cluster 2 had the highest glucose level factor and the lowest C peptide index. Cluster 4 was characterized by the greatest degree of glucose fluctuation factor, was the most insulin-sensitive, and had the lowest insulin resistance. Cluster 3 ranked in the middle concerning the CGM-derived metrics and clinical phenotypes compared with those of the other three groups.

Diabetic microvascular complications significantly impact morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) in predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN).


METHODS
A comprehensive PubMed search from 1990 to 2023 identified studies on ML/AI models for diabetic microvascular complications. The review analyzed study design, cohorts, predictors, ML techniques, prediction horizon, and performance metrics.


RESULTS
Among the 74 identified studies, 256 featured internally validated ML models and 124 had externally validated models, with about half being retrospective. Since 2010, there has been a rise in the use of ML for predicting microvascular complications, mainly driven by DKD research across 27 countries. A more modest increase in ML research on DR and DN was observed, with publications from fewer countries. For all microvascular complications, predictive models achieved a mean (standard deviation) c-statistic of 0.79 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.72 (0.12) on external validation. Diabetic kidney disease models had the highest discrimination, with c-statistics of 0.81 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.74 (0.13) on external validation, respectively. Few studies externally validated prediction of DN. The prediction horizon, outcome definitions, number and type of predictors, and ML technique significantly influenced model performance.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
There is growing global interest in using ML for predicting diabetic microvascular complications. Research on DKD is the most advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance. Both DR and DN require more research. External validation and adherence to recommended guidelines are crucial.","There is growing global interest in using ML for predicting diabetic microvascular complications, and research on DKD is the most advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance."

Several techniques and devices, such as flash glucose meters, have been developed to help T1D patients improve their quality of life. Most recently, the data collected via these devices is being used to train advanced artificial intelligence models to characterize the evolution of the disease and support its management. Data scarcity is the main challenge for generating these models, as most works use private or artificially generated datasets. For this reason, this work presents T1DiabetesGranada, an open under specific permission longitudinal dataset that not only provides continuous glucose levels, but also patient demographic and clinical information. The dataset includes 257 780 days of measurements spanning four years from 736 T1D patients from the province of Granada, Spain. This dataset advances beyond the state of the art as one the longest and largest open datasets of continuous glucose measurements, thus boosting the development of new artificial intelligence models for glucose level characterization and prediction.

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.

Additionally, a physiological model of glucose dynamics is optimized in tandem with FFNN forecasts using sequential quadratic programming and individualized constraints. Comparisons between the constrained response and ML predictions show higher root mean square error (RMSE) in certain intervals for the constrained approach.

We aimed to develop a method using CGM data to discover T2DM subtypes and investigate their relationship with clinical phenotypes and microvascular complications. Methods The data from 3119 patients with T2DM who wore blinded CGM at an academic medical centre was collected, and a glucose symbolic pattern (GSP) metric was created that combined knowledge‐based temporal abstraction with numerical vectorization. The k‐means clustering was applied to GSP to obtain subgroups of patients with T2DM. Clinical characteristics and the presence of diabetic retinopathy and albuminuria were compared among the subgroups. The findings were validated in an independent population comprising 773 patients with T2DM. Results By using GSP, four subgroups were identified with distinct features in CGM profiles and parameters. Moreover, the clustered subgroups differed significantly in clinical phenotypes, including indices of pancreatic β‐cell function and insulin resistance (all p &lt; .001). After adjusting for confounders, group C (the most insulin resistant) had a significantly higher risk of albuminuria (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.03‐1.39) relative to group D, which had the best glucose control. These findings were confirmed in the validation set.

Early identification of patients at risk of these microvascular complications using predictive models through machine learning (ML) can be helpful in T1D management. The objective of current review was to systematically identify and summarize published predictive models that used ML to assess the risk of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy in T1D patients.
 Methods: A targeted review of English literature was undertaken in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) from January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. Eligible articles were also identified from cross-references. Following concepts were used in combination to conduct the search queries: diabetes, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, microvascular complication, risk/predictive model, and ML/artificial intelligence/data mining.
 Results: A total of 3,769 hits were found from all sources combined, duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were screened, 61 studies underwent full-text review and a total of six studies met the eligibility criteria. Among them, four studies had developed risk models using data obtained from T1D patients alone, whereas two used data from both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. There was only one study that evaluated all three types of microvascular complications while the other five focused on one individual complication, i.e., either diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. Only two studies evaluated time to developing a complication. The other four studies assessed complications as either binary (yes/no) or categorical (multiple levels). Prediction models were built using cross-sectional data from survey questionnaire (n=1, Iran) and longitudinal data (n=5) which were further classified as sources of electronic medical records (EMR) (n=3, US: 1, Europe: 2), clinical trial (n=1, US) and prospective study (n=1, Europe). Common predictors across studies as well as across types of microvascular complications included age, gender, diabetes duration, BMI, blood pressure, lipid level, and mean or a single HbA1C value. Commonly used ML algorithms included classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF) (CART/RF, n=3), support vector machines (SVMs, n=2), logistic regression (LR, n=2) and neural networks (NNs, n=1). Model performance was evaluated using area under curve (AUC, n=4) and accuracy (n=2). Only half (n=3) of the included studies tested their developed models in an external dataset of patients with T1D. Conclusions: Overall, very few studies reported predictive models for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy using ML specifically for T1D patients. Future research that utilizes contemporary clinical data from T1D patients to predict the three types of microvascular complications is needed.","Overall, very few studies reported predictive models for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy using ML specifically for T1D patients, and future research that utilizes contemporary clinical data from T2D patients to predict the three types of microvascular complications is needed."

Current blood glucose monitoring (BGM) methods are often invasive and require repetitive pricking of a finger to obtain blood samples, predisposing individuals to pain, discomfort, and infection. Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring (NIBGM) is ideal for minimizing discomfort, reducing the risk of infection, and increasing convenience.


OBJECTIVE
This review aimed to map the use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) in NIBGM.


METHODS
A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the Arksey O'Malley five-step framework. Eight electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane-Central Library, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) were searched from inception until February 8, 2023. Study selection was conducted by 2 independent reviewers, descriptive analysis was conducted, and findings were presented narratively. Study characteristics (author, country, type of publication, study design, population characteristics, mean age, types of noninvasive techniques used, and application, as well as characteristics of the BGM systems) were extracted independently and cross-checked by 2 investigators. Methodological quality appraisal was conducted using the Checklist for assessment of medical AI.


RESULTS
A total of 33 papers were included, representing studies from Asia, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa published between 2005 and 2023. Most studies used optical techniques (n=19, 58%) to estimate blood glucose levels (n=27, 82%). Others used electrochemical sensors (n=4), imaging (n=2), mixed techniques (n=2), and tissue impedance (n=1). Accuracy ranged from 35.56% to 94.23% and Clarke error grid (A+B) ranged from 86.91% to 100%. The most popular machine learning algorithm used was random forest (n=10) and the most popular deep learning model was the artificial neural network (n=6). The mean overall checklist for assessment of medical AI score on the included papers was 33.5 (SD 3.09), suggesting an average of medium quality. The studies reviewed demonstrate that some AI techniques can accurately predict glucose levels from noninvasive sources while enhancing comfort and ease of use for patients. However, the overall range of accuracy was wide due to the heterogeneity of models and input data.


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts are needed to standardize and regulate the use of AI technologies in BGM, as well as develop consensus guidelines and protocols to ensure the quality and safety of AI-assisted monitoring systems. The use of AI for NIBGM is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize diabetes management.","This scoping review maps AI applications in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, finding 33 studies with varying accuracy (35.56-94.23%) and quality, highlighting the need for standardization and regulation of AI technologies in BGM."

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future. </sec> <sec> <title>CLINICALTRIAL</title> PROSPERO CRD42022303175; https://tinyurl.com/3n9jaayc </sec> ","In this paper , the authors provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in wearable devices (WDs) for forecasting or predicting BG levels."

Patrick J Schumacher","10.1177/1932296820949940","","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune chronic disease characterized by absolute insulin deficiency, which causes abnormal blood glucose regulation. Currently, there are 1.25 million Americans diagnosed with T1D with approximately 64 000 new cases of T1D being diagnosed every year.1,2 There is no cure for T1D and patients with T1D rely on daily insulin administration. So, self-management of T1D is crucial to prevent or delay major complications. However, only a very small proportion of T1D patients have met the target range set by the American Diabetes Association.3 Recent years have witnessed an explosion of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled and data-empowered innovations in treating T1D patients. For instance, closedloop systems (ie, “artificial pancreas”) and insulin pumps are reported to effectively improve T1D management as well as patient outcomes. To summarize the latest research in AI-enabled T1D treatment, we conducted a literature review with PubMed and Google Scholar to retrieve publications in peer-reviewed healthcare journals from January 2019 to May 2020 (see Table 1). Overall, continuous improvements in safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and patient satisfaction using closed-loop systems to control blood glucose level in a broader T1D population (especially pediatric patients) were reported. The newest evidence was derived from various types of studies ranging from well-designed multicenter randomized clinical trial with six-month follow-up on closedloop system to comparative study between real-time and intermittent-scanning continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and to cost-effectiveness study on a hybrid closed-loop system compared with a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion system.4-6 Notably, machine learning techniques applied in CGMs were reported to lead to significant reductions in postprandial hypoglycemia, decreased rates of closed-loop exits and alerts, improved glycemic control without detectable changes in psychosocial outcomes, and accurate prediction and prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Also, the autonomous diagnostic AI system demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing referable diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Additionally, higher glycated hemoglobin level and workload required to use hybrid closed loop were suggested to be the significant factors associated with discontinuation. In a nutshell, there have been remarkable progress in AI-enabled technology in treating T1D reported in literature since 2019. Yet, practical challenges and opportunities exist. Whether the observed benefits will sustain for prolonged use in real-world settings and how AI technologies will protect patient data privacy and security are crucial questions to address. During the past few years, personalized data, machine learning (in particular, deep learning and convolutional neural network techniques), and realtime adaptive algorithms combined with wearable devices have improved prevention and early detection, clinical decision support, deterioration risk prediction, and patient self-management of T1D. Future research endeavors and technological innovations should meet patients’ needs such as mitigating user’s workload and further enhancing outcomes, optimizing data protection, and realizing patientcentered care. Unquestionably, AI, Big Data, interdisciplinary research, and global collaboration will play an increasingly important role in achieving precision medicine for T1D patients. 949940 DSTXXX10.1177/1932296820949940Journal of Diabetes Science and TechnologyQian et al letter2020","There have been remarkable progress in AI-enabled technology in treating T1D reported in literature since 2019, and whether the observed benefits will sustain for prolonged use in real-world settings is crucial questions."

A real-time monitoring and management system is necessary to mitigate this life-threatening disease and safeguard individuals. The potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to change the management of Diabetes and enhance outcomes for persons with the condition is substantial. While AI shows promise in its ability to forecast Diabetes, it also presents a challenge due to its black-box nature. To address this concern, a proposed framework incorporating explainable AI is suggested for classifying Diabetes. This framework serves to elucidate the decisions made by the AI model. Furthermore, it was assessed using three distinct datasets categorized according to Diabetes categorization.

Poorly managed diabetes can lead to serious and life-threatening health complications. A person’s glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C or A1C) measures the average blood glucose for the past 2–3 months by measuring how much glucose is bound to the hemoglobin cells in the blood. The HbA1C is used both to diagnose diabetes and assess the effectiveness of a person’s management plan. Developing a model that can accurately predict a person’s future HbA1C 2–3 months in advance holds immense potential for preventative and tailored medical care. With the new era of artificial intelligence (AI) it becomes increasing evident that some of unanswered health issues can be unlocked by leveraging on advanced AI and machine learning algorithms. In addition, sudden plummeted or elevated blood glucose levels also pose serious and life-threating consequences to diabetic people. The development of a detection and prediction model capable of detecting or predicting instances of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia using new CGM technology is critical. This chapter discusses the consequences of poorly managed diabetes and how a more personalized treatment plan for diabetes may lie in the detection of hyper/hypoglycemic events and the prediction of a person’s HbA1C using their current blood glucose values.","The consequences of poorly managed diabetes are discussed and how a more personalized treatment plan for diabetes may lie in the detection of hyper/hypoglycemic events and the prediction of a person’s HbA1C using their current blood glucose values."

AI such as machine learning (ML) or deep learning is growing dramatically in many subjects of life and increasing speedily in medical aspects and especially in discovering diseases and medical equipment in diabetes such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with sensors [2]. Noncompliance with suggested treatment has delayed the onset of long-term problems, which can take years. As a result, diabetes management is complex, and therapeutic decisions must consider various medical aspects as well as lifestyle-related activities that must be adjusted to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly expanding area, and its applications to diabetes research are expanding even faster [3]. Diabetes does not affect just the patient but all families as need multidisciplinary care and need health education and follow-up with health-care providers to update the health condition and follow-up from complications so using the ML model will help with health education and suspect complications [4]. Using CGMs helps diabetics patients with type I diabetes to improve control and avoid hypoglycemia occurrence and avoid the frequent bricking of the skin, AI in large diabetic databases that integrate different data sources are rapidly necessitating the use of AI approaches for the creation of applications for therapy personalization and complication prevention [5]. The most challenge in diabetes management and during aerobic exercises is the occurrence of hypoglycemia so the use of AI can be giving promising role in the prevention of hypoglycemia a study by Vehí et al. introduced the patient safety system, an AI-based decision support system for the prediction and prevention of hypoglycemia events and the classification of glycemic control profiles [6]. Time in the range is very important and is considered an eye on controlling blood glucose all day. It collects blood sugar measurements from the CGM every 5 min and analyzes them in real-time using AI algorithms. Incorporating AI into future products successfully will help Medtronic fulfill its aim of employing biomedical engineering to restore health and minimize the management load for individuals with diabetes. Moreover, widen the use of time in the range using AI in CGM devices[5]. Nowadays and after more, many drugs are growing dramatically and will see hundreds of medicines and many anti-diabetic groups and many updated guidelines, and many insulin in the next year’s many groups of medications for diabetes so choosing the best suitable type of patient need more concentration and attention from doctors. Finally, AI may play a very important role in the next years to help doctors to speed up the decision for choosing the right medicines for patients using ML such as the medical history, drug history, contraindications, updated guidelines, A1C, laboratory investigations, type of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia, drug interactions, alarming when blood glucose drop and warning signals, and helping doctors at giving correct decision for fasting for patients at Ramadan and much helpful information. Furthermore, AI helps doctors at the decision at choosing the right type of insulin. Policy-makers must move quickly to equip health and social security institutions to deal with the effects of diabetes, fasten the use of AI in health education and control of diabetes, and improve outcomes using many learning machine models.

To date, CGM devices are employed for both retrospective and online applications. Their use allows to better describe the patients' pathology as well as to achieve a better control of patients' level of glycemia. The analysis of CGM sensor data makes possible to observe a wide range of metrics, such as the glycemic variability during the day or the amount of time spent below or above certain glycemic thresholds. However, due to the high variability of the glycemic signals among sensors and individuals, CGM data analysis is a non-trivial task. Standard signal filtering solutions fall short when an appropriate model personalization is not applied. State-of-the-art data-driven strategies for online CGM forecasting rely upon the use of recursive filters. Each time a new sample is collected, such models need to adjust their parameters in order to predict the next glycemic level.

These tasks are particularly challenging in daily life, especially without professional guidance.

Maintaining a good control of the disease is critical to avoid not only severe long-term complications but also dangerous short-term situations. Diabetics need to decide the appropriate insulin injection, thus they need to be able to estimate the level of glucose they are going to have after a meal. In this paper we use machine learning techniques for predicting glycemia in diabetic patients. The algorithms utilize data collected from real patients by a continuous glucose monitoring system, the estimated number of carbohydrates, and insulin administration for each meal. We compare (1) non-linear regression with fixed model structure, (2) identification of prognosis models by symbolic regression using genetic programming, (3) prognosis by k-nearest-neighbor time series search, and (4) identification of prediction models by grammatical evolution.

This is necessary as it is important to maintain glucose levels at appropriate values to avoid not only short-term, but also long-term complications of the illness. Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning techniques in particular have already lead to promising results in modeling and predicting glucose concentrations. In this work, several machine learning techniques are used for the modeling and prediction of glucose concentrations using as inputs the values measured by a continuous monitoring glucose system as well as also previous and estimated future carbohydrate intakes and insulin injections. In particular, we use the following four techniques: genetic programming, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and grammatical evolution. We propose two new enhanced modeling algorithms for glucose prediction, namely (i) a variant of grammatical evolution which uses an optimized grammar, and (ii) a variant of tree-based genetic programming which uses a three-compartment model for carbohydrate and insulin dynamics. The predictors were trained and tested using data of ten patients from a public hospital in Spain. We analyze our experimental results using the Clarke error grid metric and see that 90% of the forecasts are correct (i.e., Clarke error categories A and B), but still even the best methods produce 5 to 10% of serious errors (category D) and approximately 0.5% of very serious errors (category E).

Despite their utility, many CGM applications lack integration with other external services, such as food trackers, and do not generate useful glycemic variability (GV) metrics or advanced visualizations. Existing solutions vary in functionality: some are proprietary, many require additional user programming or custom preprocessing to meet diverse research needs, and few have created solutions to connect CGM data with external services. Recent reviews highlight gaps such as insufficient postprandial analytics, absence of composite indices, and inadequate tools for nontechnical users.

Berkowitz","10.1007/S11892-020-01353-5","","Machine learning approaches—which seek to predict outcomes or classify patient features by recognizing patterns in large datasets—are increasingly applied to clinical epidemiology research on diabetes. Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020. Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners—which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions—frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and “deep learning” can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions.","Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications, and would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons."

Noninvasive CGM (NI-CGM), in particular, is appealing for reasons related to patient comfort (no needles are used) but challenging. NI-CGM prototypes exploiting multisensor approaches have been recently proposed to deal with physiological and environmental disturbances. In these prototypes, signals measured noninvasively (e.g., skin impedance, temperature, optical skin properties, etc.) are combined through a static multivariate linear model for estimating glucose levels. In this work, by exploiting a dataset of 45 experimental sessions acquired in diabetic subjects, we show that regularisation-based techniques for the identification of the model, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (better known as LASSO), Ridge regression, and Elastic-Net regression, improve the accuracy of glucose estimates with respect to techniques, such as partial least squares regression, previously used in the literature. More specifically, the Elastic-Net model (i.e., the model identified using a combination of and norms) has the best results, according to the metrics widely accepted in the diabetes community. This model represents an important incremental step toward the development of NI-CGM devices effectively usable by patients.","This work shows that regularisation-based techniques for the identification of the model, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, Ridge regression, and Elastic-Net regression, improve the accuracy of glucose estimates with respect to techniques,such as partial least squares regression, previously used in the literature."

D. Shanmuga Priyaa","","","Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder where the body fails to produce the digestive hormone insulin, or the body’s ability to respond to insulin is limited. This situation leads to abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated blood sugar level. Type-1 diabetes (T1DM) is a condition arises mainly due to auto immunity disorder in which the immunity cells of the body mistakenly destroy the beta cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin. T1DM patients require to have proper control of their blood glucose level through proper medication, physical activities and continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels. A wide range of advanced wellbeing innovations, particularly computerized applications, have been growing quickly to assist individuals with dealing with their diabetes. Artificial Intelligence is a rapidly growing field, and its applications to diabetes research are becoming significantly more quickly. This paper is a review of six studies of existing neural network-based models for the prediction of future blood glucose level in T1DM patients and describes some challenges to predict future blood glucose with the available data.

Allan Tucker","10.5772/INTECHOPEN.94228","","The prediction of the onset of different complications of disease, in general, is challenging due to the existence of unmeasured risk factors, imbalanced data, time-varying data due to dynamics, and various interventions to the disease over time. Scholars share a common argument that many Artificial Intelligence techniques that successfully model disease are often in the form of a “black box” where the internal workings and complexities are extremely difficult to understand, both from practitioners’ and patients’ perspective. There is a need for appropriate Artificial Intelligence techniques to build predictive models that not only capture unmeasured effects to improve prediction, but are also transparent in how they model data so that knowledge about disease processes can be extracted and trust in the model can be maintained by clinicians. The proposed strategy builds probabilistic graphical models for prediction with the inclusion of informative hidden variables. These are added in a stepwise manner to improve predictive performance whilst maintaining as simple a model as possible, which is regarded as crucial for the interpretation of the prediction results. This chapter explores this key issue with a specific focus on diabetes data. According to the literature on disease modelling, especially on major diseases such as diabetes, a patient’s mortality often occurs due to the associated complications caused by the disease over time and not the disease itself. This is often patient-specific and will depend on what type of cohort a patient belongs to. Another main focus of this study is patient personalisation via precision medicine by discovering meaningful subgroups of patients which are characterised as phenotypes. These phenotypes are explained further using Bayesian network analysis methods and temporal association rules. Overall, this chapter discussed the earlier research of the chapter’s author. It explores Artificial Intelligence (IDA) techniques for modelling the progression of disease whilst simultaneously stratifying patients and doing so in a transparent manner as possible. To this end, it reviews the current literature on some of the most common Artificial Intelligent (AI) methodologies, including probabilistic modelling, association rule mining, phenotype discovery and latent variable discovery by using diabetes as a case study.","This chapter explores Artificial Intelligence techniques for modelling the progression of disease whilst simultaneously stratifying patients and doing so in a transparent manner as possible and reviews the current literature on some of the most common Artificial Intelligent methodologies."

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of AI-DSS in real world diabetes clinics.
 Methods: Data was collected and evaluated from routine AI-DSS usage for individuals with type 1 diabetes treated at 21 diabetes clinics (in the USA and 2 in Israel) . Two analyses were made: (1) Insulin dose recommendations were compared for rate of agreement/disagreement between those suggested by the AI-DSS and the approved recommendations by health care providers (HCP) . (2) Glycemic outcomes were compared between baseline and after 3 months of AI-DSS use. Included in this analysis were individuals who had mean baseline glucose level ≥ 182 mg/dL and at least one AI-DSS recommendation within the 3-months.
 Results: A total of 8 recommendations, provided to 370 individuals, were evaluated. Full agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments was observed in 87%, 87%, and 83% of the basal rate, carbs ratio (CR) , and correction factor (CF) pump settings parameters, respectively. Full disagreement on the direction of dose change was observed in only 0.9%, 0.5%, and 1.2% for the basal rate, CR and CF, respectively. Glycemic outcome analysis included 1 eligible individuals (mean of 1.6 recommendations within a 3-month interval) . Average sensor percentage of time in range [70-180 mg/dL] increased by 4% (p=0.003) : 43% increased time in range by more than 5% and 33% increased by 10% or more. Time in hyperglycemia [> 180 mg/dL] was reduced by 5% (p<0.01) while time in severe hypoglycemia [< 54 mg/dL] remained below 0.5%.
 Conclusion: A high rate of agreement with automated insulin adjustments was observed among HCPs at academic centers who used the AI-DSS in their workflow. Glycemic control was significantly improved for sub-optimally controlled individuals already after 3-months of follow up.

Digital health takes into account the ever-increasing synergy between advanced medical technologies, innovation, and digital communication. Thanks to machine learning, we are not limited anymore to a descriptive analysis of the data, as we can obtain greater value by identifying and predicting patterns resulting from inductive reasoning. Machine learning software programs that disclose the reasoning behind a prediction allow for ""what-if"" models by which it is possible to understand if and how, by changing certain factors, one may improve the outcomes, thereby identifying the optimal behavior. Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability. In this context, new digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are certainly a great opportunity. Herein, we report the results of a careful analysis of the current literature and represent the vision of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD) on this controversial topic that, if well used, may be the key for a great scientific innovation. AMD believes that the use of artificial intelligence will enable the conversion of data (descriptive) into knowledge of the factors that ""affect"" the behavior and correlations (predictive), thereby identifying the key aspects that may establish an improvement of the expected results (prescriptive). Artificial intelligence can therefore become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine. This, in turn, will allow for comprehensive therapies to be built in accordance with the evidence criteria that should always be the ground for any therapeutic choice.","Artificial intelligence can become a tool of great technical support to help diabetologists become fully responsible of the individual patient, thereby assuring customized and precise medicine."

For example, in the therapy of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), in which, for patient safety, glucose concentration in the blood should be maintained in a defined normoglycemic range, the ability to forecast glucose concentration in the short-term (with a prediction horizon of around 30 min) might be sufficient to reduce the incidence of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events. Neural Network (NN) approaches are suitable for prediction purposes because of their ability to model nonlinear dynamics and handle in their inputs signals coming from different domains. In this chapter we illustrate the design of a jump NN glucose prediction algorithm that exploits past glucose concentration data, measured in real-time by a minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, and information on ingested carbohydrates, supplied by the patient himself or herself. The methodology is assessed by tuning the NN on data of ten T1D individuals and then testing it on a dataset of ten different subjects. Results with a prediction horizon of 30 min show that prediction of glucose concentration in T1D via NN is feasible and sufficiently accurate. The average time anticipation obtained is compatible with the generation of preventive hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic alerts and the improvement of artificial pancreas performance.","Results with a prediction horizon of 30 min show that prediction of glucose concentration in T1D via NN is feasible and sufficiently accurate and the average time anticipation obtained is compatible with the generation of preventive hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic alerts and the improvement of artificial pancreas performance."

The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits. The pilot version of the SMARTDIAB has already been implemented, while the platform's evaluation in clinical environment is being in progress.","The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits."

Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.","This paper uses three forecasting machines, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts."

AI medical applications include diagnosis, categorization, therapy, and robotics, among others. We are no longer confined to descriptive data analysis because we may acquire a larger by recognizing and anticipating patterns coming from inductive reasoning, owing to medical learning. AI applications have the potential to revolutionize diabetic care by assisting millions of people with diabetes in achieving better blood glucose management, reducing hyperglycemic episodes, and lowering diabetic morbidity and complications. We can see the evolution of closed-loop insulin delivery systems with inbuilt AI algorithms to safeguard both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in Type 1 diabetes, which have been relatively few attempts in management techniques for diabetes excursions. The medication you choose and how much you take depend on a variety of factors, including your body mass index, which influences beta-cell activity and insulin resistance, among other things. There are great assessments of research that have employed an AI approach to treat diabetes. The only way to deal with vast, diverse datasets is to rely solely on quantitative data. At this point, there are numerous issues with absolute reliance on quantitative data, depending on the frequently poor quality of this sort of information, as well as the necessity to complement combining a quantitative and qualitative approach. Attempting toward the transformation of unstructured data into digitally processed information data is a domain of cognitive computing that is predicted to grow in importance.

However, HbA1c is subject to non-glycemic influences which confound interpretation and as a measure of average glycemia does not provide information regarding glucose trends or about the occurrence of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia episodes. As such, solitary use of HbA1c, without accompanying glucose data, does not confer actionable information that can be harnessed to guide targeted therapy in many patients with DM. While conventional capillary blood glucose monitoring (BGM) sheds light on momentary glucose levels, in practical use the inherent infrequency of measurement precludes elucidation of glycemic trends or reliable detection of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia episodes. In contrast, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data reveal glucose trends and potentially undetected hypo- and hyperglycemia patterns that can occur between discrete BGM measurements. The use of CGM has grown significantly over the past decades as an ever-expanding body of literature demonstrates a multitude of clinical benefits for people with DM. Continually improving CGM accuracy and ease of use have further fueled the widespread adoption of CGM. Furthermore, percent time in range correlates well with HbA1c, is accepted as a validated indicator of glycemia, and is associated with the risk of several DM complications. We explore the benefits and limitations of CGM use, the use of CGM in clinical practice, and the application of CGM to advanced diabetes technologies.","In this paper , the benefits and limitations of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use, the use of CGM in clinical practice, and the application of CRF to advanced diabetes technologies are explored."

Nevertheless, most of the people who have diabetes lead a sedentary lifestyle. Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback. Objective: The aim of this study was to help type 2 diabetes patients increase the level of their physical activity. Methods: We provided 27 sedentary type 2 diabetes patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent short message service messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning algorithm so as to improve each participant’s compliance with the activity regimen. The algorithm was compared with a static policy for sending messages and weekly reminders. Results: Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the learning algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, whereas the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the learning algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) compared with control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise.

The predictor combines a neural network (NN) model and a first-order polynomial extrapolation algorithm, used in parallel to describe, respectively, the nonlinear and the linear components of glucose dynamics. Information on the glucose rate of appearance after a meal is described by a previously published physiological model. The method is assessed on 20 simulated datasets and on 9 real Abbott FreeStyle Navigator datasets, and its performance is successfully compared with that of a recently proposed NN glucose predictor. Results suggest that exploiting meal information improves the accuracy of short-time glucose prediction.","This paper proposes an algorithm for short-time glucose prediction using past CGM sensor readings and information on carbohydrate intake that combines a neural network model and a first-order polynomial extrapolation algorithm, used in parallel to describe the nonlinear and the linear components of glucose dynamics."

Previous work addressed this challenge by predicting the blood glucose levels using regression models. However, these approaches required a physiological model, representing the human body's response to insulin and glucose intake, or are not directly applicable to mobile platforms (smart phones, tablets).

Using an online software simulator program, we trained a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and exported the parameter settings to our mobile platform. The prediction accuracy of our mobile platform was evaluated with pre-recorded data of a type 1 diabetes patient. The blood glucose level was predicted with an error of 19 % compared to the true value.

This is achieved by means of applying a retrospective optimization of the insulin bolus therapy using a novel combination of run-to-run (R2R) that uses intermittent continuous glucose monitoring data, and case-based reasoning (CBR). The validity of the proposed approach has been proven by in-silico studies using the FDA-accepted UVa-Padova type 1 diabetes simulator.

As the starting point, an inclusive list of (k) diabetes complications and (n) their correlated predisposing factors are derived from the existing endocrinology text books. A type of data meta-analysis has been done to extract and combine the numeric value of the relationships between these two. The whole n (risk factors) - k (complications) model was broken down into k different (n-1) relationships and these (n-1) dependencies were broken into n (1-1) models. Applying regression analysis (seven patterns) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we created models to show the (1-1) correspondence between factors and complications. Then all 1-1 models related to an individual complication were integrated using the naive Bayes theorem. Finally, a Bayesian belief network was developed to show the influence of all risk factors and complications on each other. We assessed the predictive power of the 1-1 models by R2, F-ratio and adjusted R2 equations; sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the final model using real patient data.

Time series prediction can be a very useful tool in the field of insulin-dependent diabetes to forecast and to study the behavior of key process parameters in time. Blood glucose (BG) levels prediction provides the possibility to issue early warnings related to ineffective or poor treatments. Consequently, the appropriate responses would allow us to avoid hyper and hypoglycemic events which will improve overall health, safety, and the quality of life of T1D patients. This work concerns with the time series prediction based on grammatical evolution methodologies (GE). The grammar-based feature generation allows to build complex empirical models using a basic knowledge of T1D dynamics. Final solutions involve model adjustment by training with patient specific data.

The primary prerequisite to a successful artificial pancreas, and to optimal diabetes control in general, is the continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which measures glucose levels frequently (e.g., every 5 min). Thus, a CGM collects detailed glucose time series, which carry significant information about the dynamics of glucose fluctuations. However, a CGM assesses blood glucose indirectly via subcutaneous determinations. As a result, two types of analytical problems arise for the retrieval and interpretation of CGM data: (1) the order and the timing of CGM readings and (2) sensor errors, time lag, and deviations from BG need to be accounted for. In order to improve the quality of information extracted from CGM data, we suggest several analytical and data visualization methods. These analyses evaluate CGM errors, assess risks associated with glucose variability, quantify glucose system stability, and predict glucose fluctuation. All analyses are illustrated with data collected using MiniMed CGMS (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) and Freestyle Navigator (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA). It is important to remember that traditional statistics do not work well with CGM data because consecutive CGM readings are highly interdependent. In conclusion, advanced analysis and visualization of CGM data allow for evaluation of dynamical characteristics of diabetes and reveal clinical information that is inaccessible via standard statistics, which do not take into account the temporal structure of data. The use of such methods has the potential to enable optimal glycemic control in diabetes and, in the future, artificial pancreas systems.","Advanced analysis and visualization of CGM data allow for evaluation of dynamical characteristics of diabetes and reveal clinical information that is inaccessible via standard statistics, which do not take into account the temporal structure of data."

Missing data is a common issue in (electronic) patient records, thus the models are paired with a module for the intelligent management of missing information. Results The system has been deployed and made publicly available as Web service, and it has been fully integrated within the diabetes-management platform developed by the European project REACTION. Preliminary usability tests showed that the clinicians judged the models useful for risk assessment and for communicating the risk to the patient. Furthermore, the system performs as well as the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine when both systems are tested on an independent cohort of UK diabetes patients.

CHO counting is very challenging but also crucial, since an error of 20 grams can substantially impair postprandial control. Method: The GoCARB system is a smartphone application designed to support T1D patients with CHO counting of nonpacked foods. In a typical scenario, the user places a reference card next to the dish and acquires 2 images with his/her smartphone. From these images, the plate is detected and the different food items on the plate are automatically segmented and recognized, while their 3D shape is reconstructed. Finally, the food volumes are calculated and the CHO content is estimated by combining the previous results and using the USDA nutritional database. Results: To evaluate the proposed system, a set of 24 multi-food dishes was used. For each dish, 3 pairs of images were taken and for each pair, the system was applied 4 times. The mean absolute percentage error in CHO estimation was 10 ± 12%, which led to a mean absolute error of 6 ± 8 CHO grams for normal-sized dishes. Conclusion: The laboratory experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the GoCARB prototype system since the error was below the initial goal of 20 grams. However, further improvements and evaluation are needed prior launching a system able to meet the inter- and intracultural eating habits.","The laboratory experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the GoCARB prototype system since the error was below the initial goal of 20 grams, however, further improvements and evaluation are needed prior launching a system able to meet the inter- and intracultural eating habits."

In particular, hypo and hyperglycemia can be promptly detected when glucose exceeds the normal range thresholds, and even avoided through the use of on-line glucose prediction algorithms. Several algorithms with prediction horizon (PH) of 15–30–45 min have been proposed in the literature, e.g. including AR/ARMA time-series modeling and neural networks. Most of them are fed by CGM signals only. The purpose of this work is to develop a new short-term glucose prediction algorithm based on a neural network that, in addition to past CGM readings, also exploits information on carbohydrates intakes quantitatively described through a physiological model. Results on simulated data quantitatively show that the new method outperforms other published algorithms.

Professional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which produces a glucose reading every 5 min, is a powerful tool for retrospective identification of unrecognized hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, CGM devices tend to be inaccurate, especially in the hypoglycemic range, which limits their applicability for hypoglycemia detection. The objective of this study was to develop an automated pattern recognition algorithm to detect hypoglycemic events in retrospective, professional CGM. Method: Continuous glucose monitoring and plasma glucose (PG) readings were obtained from 17 data sets of 10 type 1 diabetes patients undergoing insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The CGM readings were automatically classified into a hypoglycemic group and a nonhypoglycemic group on the basis of different features from CGM readings and insulin injection. The classification was evaluated by comparing the automated classification with PG using sample-based and event-based sensitivity and specificity measures. Results: With an event-based sensitivity of 100%, the algorithm produced only one false hypoglycemia detection. The sample-based sensitivity and specificity levels were 78% and 96%, respectively. Conclusions: The automated pattern recognition algorithm provides a new approach for detecting unrecognized hypoglycemic events in professional CGM data. The tool may assist physicians and diabetologists in conducting a more thorough evaluation of the diabetes patient’s glycemic control and in initiating necessary measures for improving glycemic control.","The automated pattern recognition algorithm provides a new approach for detecting unrecognized hypoglycemic events in professional CGM data that may assist physicians and diabetologists in conducting a more thorough evaluation of the diabetes patient's glycemic control and in initiating necessary measures for improving glycemic Control."

Traditional basal/bolus therapy is not fully optimized for meals of varied fat contents. Thus, regimens for low- and high-fat meals were developed to improve current insulin pump therapy. Simulations of meals with varied fat content demonstrably replicated published data. Subsequently, an insulin profile library with optimized delivery regimens under open and closed loop for various meal compositions was constructed using particle swarm optimization. Calculations showed that the optimal basal bolus insulin profiles for low-fat meals comprise a normal bolus or a short wave. The preferred delivery for high-fat meals is typically biphasic, but can extend to multiple phases depending on meal characteristics. Results also revealed that patients that are highly sensitive to insulin could benefit from biphasic deliveries. Preliminary investigations of the optimal closed-loop regimens also display bi- or multiphasic patterns for high-fat meals. The novel insulin delivery profiles present new waveforms that provide better control of postprandial glucose excursions than existing schemes. Furthermore, the proposed novel regimens are also more or similarly robust to uncertainties in meal parameter estimates, with the closed-loop schemes demonstrating superior performance and robustness.","The novel insulin delivery profiles present new waveforms that provide better control of postprandial glucose excursions than existing schemes, and are also more or similarly robust to uncertainties in meal parameter estimates."

The recent availability of mobile phones with enhanced capabilities, together with the advances in computer vision, have permitted the development of image analysis apps for the automated assessment of meals. GoCARB is a mobile phone-based system designed to support individuals with type 1 diabetes during daily carbohydrate estimation. In a typical scenario, the user places a reference card next to the dish and acquires two images using a mobile phone. A series of computer vision modules detect the plate and automatically segment and recognize the different food items, while their 3D shape is reconstructed. Finally, the carbohydrate content is calculated by combining the volume of each food item with the nutritional information provided by the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of the GoCARB prototype when used by individuals with type 1 diabetes and to compare it to their own performance in carbohydrate counting. In addition, the user experience and usability of the system is evaluated by questionnaires. Methods: The study was conducted at the Bern University Hospital, “Inselspital” (Bern, Switzerland) and involved 19 adult volunteers with type 1 diabetes, each participating once. Each study day, a total of six meals of broad diversity were taken from the hospital’s restaurant and presented to the participants. The food items were weighed on a standard balance and the true amount of carbohydrate was calculated from the USDA nutrient database. Participants were asked to count the carbohydrate content of each meal independently and then by using GoCARB. At the end of each session, a questionnaire was completed to assess the user’s experience with GoCARB. Results: The mean absolute error was 27.89 (SD 38.20) grams of carbohydrate for the estimation of participants, whereas the corresponding value for the GoCARB system was 12.28 (SD 9.56) grams of carbohydrate, which was a significantly better performance (P=.001). In 75.4% (86/114) of the meals, the GoCARB automatic segmentation was successful and 85.1% (291/342) of individual food items were successfully recognized. Most participants found GoCARB easy to use. Conclusions: This study indicates that the system is able to estimate, on average, the carbohydrate content of meals with higher accuracy than individuals with type 1 diabetes can.

In this study, the s.c. glucose prediction is treated as a multivariate regression problem, which is addressed using support vector regression (SVR). The proposed method is based on variables concerning: 1) the s.c. glucose profile; 2) the plasma insulin concentration; 3) the appearance of meal-derived glucose in the systemic circulation; and 4) the energy expenditure during physical activities. Six cases corresponding to different combinations of the aforementioned variables are used to investigate the influence of the input on the daily glucose prediction. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset of 27 patients in free-living conditions. Tenfold cross validation is applied to each dataset individually to both optimize and test the SVR model. In the case, where all the input variables are considered, the average prediction errors are 5.21, 6.03, 7.14, and 7.62 mg/dl for 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min prediction horizons, respectively.

The integration of all these different devices, and interfaces, as well as the automated analysis and representation of all the pieces of information are current key challenges in telemedicine. Mobile phone technology has just begun to offer great opportunities of using this diverse information for guiding, warning, and educating patients, thus increasing their autonomy and adherence to their prescriptions. However, most of these existing mobile solutions are not based on platform systems and therefore represent limited, isolated applications. This article depicts how telemedical systems, based on integrated health data platforms, can maximize prescription adherence in chronic patients through mobile feedback.

Methods: Realistic type 1 diabetes (T1D) models from the literature were combined into a composite system. Using a mixture of “black box” simulations and actual data from diabetic medical histories, realistic sets of diabetic time series were constructed for blood glucose (BG), interstitial fluid glucose, infused insulin, meal estimates, and sometimes plasma insulin assays. The problem of underdetermined parameters was side stepped by applying a variant of a genetic algorithm to partial information, whereby multiple candidate-personalized models were constructed and then rigorously tested using further data. These formed a “dynamic envelope” of trajectories in state space, where each trajectory was generated by a hypothesis on the hidden T1D system dynamics. This dynamic envelope was then culled to a reduced form to cover observed dynamic behavior. A machineintelligent autonomous algorithm then implemented game theory to construct real-time insulin infusion strategies, based on the flow of these trajectories through state space and their interactions with hypoglycemic or near-hyperglycemic states. Results: This technique was tested on 2 simulated participants over a total of fifty-five 24-hour days, with no hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events, despite significant uncertainties from using actual diabetic meal histories with 10-minute warnings. In the main case studies, BG was steered within the desired target set for 99.8% of a 16-hour daily assessment period. Tests confirmed algorithm robustness for ±25% carbohydrate error. For over 99% of the overall 55-day simulation period, either formal controller stability was achieved to the desired target or else the trajectory was within the desired target. Conclusions: These results suggest that this is a stable, high-confidence way to generate closed-loop insulin infusion strategies.","This study demonstrated the novel application of a “machine-intelligent” mathematical structure, combining differential game theory and Lyapunov-based control theory, to the artificial pancreas to handle dynamic uncertainties and suggests that this is a stable, high-confidence way to generate closed-loop insulin infusion strategies."

With the objective of a dependable decision support system for T1DM self-management, we aim to model glucose dynamics using their nonlinear chaotic properties. A group of patients was monitored via continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors for several days under free-living conditions. We assessed the glycemic variability (GV) and chaotic properties of each time series. Time series were subsequently transformed into the phase-space and individual autoregressive (AR) models were applied to predict glucose values over 30-minute and 60-minute prediction horizons (PH). The logistic smooth transition AR (LSTAR) model provided the best prediction accuracy for patients with high GV.

Various complications are associated with type 2 diabetes, with diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of renal failure among diabetics. Often, when patients are diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, their renal functions have already been significantly damaged. Therefore, a risk prediction tool may be beneficial for the implementation of early treatment and prevention. In the present study, we developed a decision tree-based model integrating genetic and clinical features in a gender-specific classification for the identification of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 diabetic patients. Clinical and genotyping data were obtained from a previous genetic association study involving 345 type 2 diabetic patients (185 with diabetic nephropathy and 160 without diabetic nephropathy). Using a five-fold cross-validation approach, the performance of using clinical or genetic features alone in various classifiers (decision tree, random forest, Naive Bayes, and support vector machine) was compared with that of utilizing a combination of attributes. The inclusion of genetic features and the implementation of an additional gender-based rule yielded better classification results. The current model supports the notion that genes and gender are contributing factors of diabetic nephropathy. Further refinement of the proposed approach has the potential to facilitate the early identification of diabetic nephropathy and the development of more efficient treatment in a clinical setting.","A decision tree-based model integrating genetic and clinical features in a gender-specific classification for the identification of diabetic nephropathy among type 2 diabetic patients supports the notion that genes and gender are contributing factors of diabetic neutropathy."

In diabetes management, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are used for three primary application which are closed-loop control algorithms, glucose prediction through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) biosensors and AI algorithms, and the calibration of CGM biosensors with the assistance of AI algorithms. Integration of AI technologies into diabetes care supports better clinical outcomes, thereby reducing administrative burden and costs associated with diabetes management. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems, which plays vital role for immediate glucose data delivery, have shown effectiveness in improving diabetes management by reducing HbA1c levels and empowering self-care skills. This has nurtured an increased sense of confidence among patients in managing their medical condition. However, the successful adoption of these technologies requires substantial support from healthcare professionals and family members to ensure adherence and effective use, especially considering factors like family income, educational background, and technological proficiency.

The aim of this study is to design and evaluate a hypoglycemia / hyperglycemia early warning system (EWS) for T1DM patients under sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy.

Methods: The EWS is based on the combination of data-driven online adaptive prediction models and a warning algorithm. Three modeling approaches have been investigated: (i) autoregressive (ARX) models, (ii) auto-regressive with an output correction module (cARX) models, and (iii) recurrent neural network (RNN) models. The warning algorithm performs postprocessing of the models′ outputs and issues alerts if upcoming hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events are detected. Fusion of the cARX and RNN models, due to their complementary prediction performances, resulted in the hybrid autoregressive with an output correction module/recurrent neural network (cARN)-based EWS.

Results: The EWS was evaluated on 23 T1DM patients under SAP therapy. The ARX-based system achieved hypoglycemic (hyperglycemic) event prediction with median values of accuracy of 100.0% (100.0%), detection time of 10.0 (8.0) min, and daily false alarms of 0.7 (0.5). The respective values for the cARX-based system were 100.0% (100.0%), 17.5 (14.8) min, and 1.5 (1.3) and, for the RNN-based system, were 100.0% (92.0%), 8.4 (7.0) min, and 0.1 (0.2). The hybrid cARN-based EWS presented outperforming results with 100.0% (100.0%) prediction accuracy, detection 16.7 (14.7) min in advance, and 0.8 (0.8) daily false alarms.

Conclusion: Combined use of cARX and RNN models for the development of an EWS outperformed the single use of each model, achieving accurate and prompt event prediction with few false alarms, thus providing increased safety and comfort.","Combined use of cARX and RNN models for the development of an EWS outperformed the single use of each model, achieving accurate and prompt event prediction with few false alarms, thus providing increased safety and comfort."

Many approaches based on artificial network and machine learning algorithms have been developed and tested against diabetes datasets, which were mostly related to individuals of Pima Indian origin. Yet, despite high accuracies of up to 99% in predicting the correct diabetes diagnosis, none of these approaches have reached clinical application so far. One reason for this failure may be that diabetologists or clinical investigators are sparsely informed about, or trained in the use of, computational diagnosis tools. Therefore, this article aims at sketching out an outline of the wide range of options, recent developments, and potentials in machine learning algorithms as diabetes diagnosis tools. One focus is on supervised and unsupervised methods, which have made significant impacts in the detection and diagnosis of diabetes at primary and advanced stages. Particular attention is paid to algorithms that show promise in improving diabetes diagnosis. A key advance has been the development of a more in-depth understanding and theoretical analysis of critical issues related to algorithmic construction and learning theory. These include trade-offs for maximizing generalization performance, use of physically realistic constraints, and incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainty. The review presents and explains the most accurate algorithms, and discusses advantages and pitfalls of methodologies. This should provide a good resource for researchers from all backgrounds interested in computational intelligence-based diabetes diagnosis methods, and allows them to extend their knowledge into this kind of research.","An outline of the wide range of options, recent developments, and potentials in machine learning algorithms as diabetes diagnosis tools is sketches out, which includes supervised and unsupervised methods, which have made significant impacts in the detection and diagnosis of diabetes at primary and advanced stages."

Hyperglycemia can cause serious health problems if left untreated such as heart disease, stroke, vision and nerve problems. Based on the electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters, we have identified hyperglycemic and normoglycemic states in T1DM patients. In this study, a classification unit is introduced with the approach of feed forward multi-layer neural network to detect the presences of hyperglycemic/normoglycemic episodes using ECG parameters as inputs. A practical experiment using the real T1DM patients' data sets collected from Department of Health, Government of Western Australia is studied. Experimental results show that proposed ECG parameters contributed significantly to the good performance of hyperglycemia detections in term of sensitivity, specificity and geometric mean (70.59%, 65.38%, and 67.94%, respectively). From these results, it is proved that hyperglycemic events in T1DM can be detected non-invasively and effectively by using ECG signals and ANN approach.","It is proved that hyperglycemic events in T1DM can be detected non-invasively and effectively by using ECG signals and ANN approach."

An artificial pancreas for automated treatment could boost quality of glucose control and patients' independence. The components required for an artificial pancreas are: i) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), ii) smart controllers and iii) insulin pumps delivering the optimal amount of insulin. In recent years, medical devices for CGM and insulin administration have undergone rapid progression and are now commercially available. Yet, clinically available devices still require regular patients' or caregivers' attention as they operate in open-loop control with frequent user intervention. Dosage-calculating algorithms are currently being studied in intensive care patients [1] , for short overnight control to supplement conventional insulin delivery [2] , and for short periods where patients rest and follow a prescribed food regime [3] . Fully automated algorithms that can respond to the varying activity levels seen in outpatients, with unpredictable and unreported food intake, and which provide the necessary personalized control for individuals is currently beyond the state-of-the-art.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems consisting of treatment algorithms calibrated through large datasets of patient specific information may offer a solution. Such a system can predict BG level changes resulting from regimen disturbances and recommend regimen changes for compensation. A software prototype based on neural network, fuzzy logic, and expert system concepts was developed and evaluated to determine feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific prediction model. BG data are the primary driver for adapting existing functions to patient specific prediction algorithms. Mean absolute percent error (MAPE) between actual and predicted BG values from inputs of daily insulin, food, and exercise information for an T1DM test subject was 10.5% using a calibrated model. The prototype is limited by the requirement for a rigid testing schedule, human error and situational circumstances such as alcohol consumption, illness, infection, stress, and significant hormonal imbalances. No significant conclusions regarding model validity can be drawn due to limited evaluation process and subject sample size, although the prototype has demonstrated viability as a learning tool for diabetes patients. Increased impetus for further development of this prototype and similar AI models may materialize when more effective diagnostic and data capture tools become available to reduce testing and improve accuracy of the model with more input data.","A software prototype based on neural network, fuzzy logic, and expert system concepts was developed and evaluated to determine feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific prediction model and has demonstrated viability as a learning tool for diabetes patients."

Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals, through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback. 
We provided 27 sedentary diabetes type 2 patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent SMS messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm which optimized messages to improve each participant's compliance with the activity regimen. The RL algorithm was compared to a static policy for sending messages and to weekly reminders. 
Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the RL algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, while the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the RL algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) compared to control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise. 
Our results suggest that a mobile phone application coupled with a learning algorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. As a learning algorithm is automated, and delivers personalized messages, it could be used in large populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control. Our results can be expanded to other areas where computer-led health coaching of humans may have a positive impact.","In this paper, the authors used reinforcement learning (RL) to encourage diabetic patients to participate in physical activity, and found that participants who received messages generated by the RL algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking while the control group patients did not."

A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples.

In some cases, patients with type 2 diabetes not only behave differently from other patients, but the severity of a given health problem varies even for an individual patient. We focus on understanding how and when patients differ from other patients. In addition, we also look at the diversity that exists within an individual patient especially over time-periods throughout the day. Our aim is to identify such time intervals when a patient may need more targeted care. Thus, for type 2 Diabetes we identify which time-periods exhibit a mismatch in terms of the blood glucose readings and the insulin doses. For instance, if the blood glucose readings fluctuate and the insulin doses are fixed it may indicate a poor management of the insulin doses and therefore a poor management of Diabetes.

A real-time patient monitoring and feedback system is one of the solutions to help patients with diabetes and their healthcare professionals monitor health-related measurements and provide dynamic feedback. However, data-driven methods to dynamically prioritize and generate tasks are not well investigated in the domain of remote health monitoring. This paper presents a wireless health project (WANDA) that leverages sensor technology and wireless communication to monitor the health status of patients with diabetes. The WANDA dynamic task management function applies data analytics in real-time to discretize continuous features, applying data clustering and association rule mining techniques to manage a sliding window size dynamically and to prioritize required user tasks. The developed algorithm minimizes the number of daily action items required by patients with diabetes using association rules that satisfy a minimum support, confidence and conditional probability thresholds. Each of these tasks maximizes information gain, thereby improving the overall level of patient adherence and satisfaction. Experimental results from applying EM-based clustering and Apriori algorithms show that the developed algorithm can predict further events with higher confidence levels and reduce the number of user tasks by up to 76.19 %.","A wireless health project (WANDA) that leverages sensor technology and wireless communication to monitor the health status of patients with diabetes and can predict further events with higher confidence levels and reduce the number of user tasks by up to 76.19 %."

This paper presents a strategy for m-health applications in diabetes self-management that is based on automatic generation of feedback messages. A feedback assistant, representing the core of architecture, delivers dynamic and automatically updated text messages set up on clinical guideline and patient’s lifestyle. Based on this strategy, an m-health adherence system was designed, developed and tested in a small-scale exploratory study with T1DM and T2DM patients. The results indicate that the system could be feasible and well accepted and that its usage increased along with adherence to prescriptions during the 4 weeks of the study. A more extensive research is pending to corroborate these outcomes and to establish a clear benefit of the proposed solution.","A strategy for m-health applications in diabetes self-management that is based on automatic generation of feedback messages, designed, developed and tested and indicates that the system could be feasible and well accepted and that its usage increased along with adherence to prescriptions during the 4 weeks of the study."

The literature on data science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) contains important knowledge and understanding of AI entities such as Data science, machine learning, deep learning, Medical image processing, feature extraction, classification techniques, etc. Diabetes diagnosis is a phenomenon that impacts individuals around the globe. Now, with diabetes impacting people from children to the elderly, the out-dated approaches to diabetes diagnosis should be replaced with new, time-saving technologies. There's several studies carried out by researchers to recognise and predict diabetes. Here plenty of classifiers in machine learning can be used, such as KNN, Random Tree, etc.They can save time and get more precise outcome when using these techniques to predict diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a typical disorder of diabetic disease that induces vision-impacting lesions in the retina. It also can turn to visual impairment if it is not addressed early. DR therapy only helps vision. Deep learning has in recent times being one of the most widely used approaches that has accomplished higher outcomes in so many fields, especially in the analysing and identification of medical image classification. In medical image processing, convolutional neural networks (CNN) using transfer learning are commonly used as a deep learning approach and they are incredibly beneficial. Key words: Diab","This study compares machine learning techniques for diabetes diagnosis and diabetic retinopathy detection using Artificial Intelligence, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, in predicting diabetes and identifying retinopathy."
