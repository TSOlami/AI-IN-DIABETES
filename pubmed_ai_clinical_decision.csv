A retrospective analysis was conducted on 442 patients diagnosed with carotid atherosclerosis at a tertiary hospital in China between January 1, 2022, and June 20, 2025. Patients were divided into CHD and non-CHD groups based on clinical outcomes. Data encompassing demographics, laboratory results, and vascular imaging findings were collected. Feature selection involved logistic regression (LR), identifying 5 key predictors: age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and the presence of carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Seven machine learning algorithms (LR, XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and stacking ensemble) were trained and evaluated. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, with metrics including area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Model interpretability was evaluated using Shapley Additive Explanations, while clinical utility was determined through calibration and decision curve analysis. All models demonstrated satisfactory performance, with the LR model achieving the highest area under the curve of 0.838 on the testing set, indicating balanced sensitivity and specificity. Shapley Additive Explanations analysis identified carotid plaque and TIA as the most influential predictors. Calibration and decision curve analysis curves indicated strong agreement between predicted and observed risks, leading to a significant clinical net benefit. An interpretable LR model incorporating age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, TIA, and carotid plaque enables reliable CHD risk stratification among patients with carotid atherosclerosis. This model serves as a practical, explainable tool for individualized risk assessment and early clinical decision support in this high-risk population."

Existing deep learning methods rely on large labeled datasets, inefficient use of unlabeled data, and limited interpretability, restricting clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture coupled with innovative semi-supervised learning (SSL) and explainability techniques to enhance multiclass eye disease classification. Our methodology integrates a ConvNeXt backbone with Transformer modules, leveraging multi-head attention to effectively capture both spatial features and long-range dependencies. We introduce Uncertainty-Guided MixMatch (UG-MixMatch), a semi-supervised framework that leverages Monte Carlo (MC) dropout for uncertainty quantification and pseudo-label refinement, effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. For interpretability, we propose a novel Gradient-based Integrated Attention Map (GIAM), which aggregates attention maps across multiple layers. It incorporates adaptive channel-wise weighting, offering more detailed insights into model predictions, surpassing traditional Grad-CAM methods. Evaluated on the Ocular Imaging Health (OIH) dataset of 4215 fundus images across four classes, our approach achieved a 95.27 % classification accuracy using UG-MixMatch and 95.51 % when incorporating MC dropout for direct model evaluation. Cohen's kappa score reached 93.70, indicating near-perfect agreement with the ground truth. Class-wise performance was exceptional, with 100 % sensitivity and specificity for DR and over 95 % specificity for cataract and glaucoma. Robust AUC values were observed, including 1.00 for DR and cataract and 0.99 for glaucoma and healthy cases. GIAM visualizations effectively highlighted disease-relevant regions, offering enhanced clinical interpretability and validation potential. Our framework addresses data scarcity, enhances interpretability, and delivers clinically relevant performance, a promising step towards scalable, explainable, and accurate diagnostic tools for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and ophthalmic screening."

While traditional machine learning (ML) models excel at predicting outcomes, such as identifying high-risk patients, they are limited in addressing ""what if"" questions about interventions. This study introduces the Probabilistic Causal Fusion (PCF) framework, which integrates Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) and Probability Trees (PTrees) to extend beyond predictions. PCF leverages causal relationships from CBNs to structure PTrees, enabling both the quantification of factor impacts and the simulation of hypothetical interventions. The framework is evaluated on three clinically diverse, real-world datasets, MIMIC-IV, Framingham Heart Study, and BRFSS (Diabetes), demonstrating consistent predictive performance comparable to conventional ML models, while offering enhanced interpretability and causal reasoning capabilities. In contrast to conventional approaches focused solely on prediction, PCF offers a unified framework for prediction, intervention modelling, and counterfactual analysis, forming a holistic toolkit for clinical decision support. To enhance interpretability, PCF incorporates sensitivity analysis and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Sensitivity analysis quantifies the influence of causal parameters on outcomes such as Length of Stay (LOS), Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), and Diabetes, while SHAP highlights the importance of individual features in predictive modelling. This dual-layered interpretability offers both macro-level insights into causal pathways and micro-level explanations for individual predictions. By combining causal reasoning with predictive modelling, PCF bridges the gap between clinical intuition and data-driven insights. Its ability to uncover relationships between modifiable factors and simulate hypothetical scenarios provides clinicians with a clearer understanding of causal pathways. This approach supports more informed, evidence-based decision-making, offering a robust framework for addressing complex questions in diverse healthcare settings."

While traditional screening methods rely heavily on manual ophthalmologic evaluations, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have opened new avenues for automated, scalable, and interpretable diagnostic tools. However, challenges persist in developing models that are not only high-performing but also transparent enough to gain clinical trust.ObjectiveThis study introduces a novel, standardized, and interpretable ML framework designed specifically to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for DR risk prediction. By prioritizing model interpretability alongside predictive performance, our approach aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and clinical applicability.MethodsWe evaluated eleven ML algorithms, optimizing hyperparameters via grid search and five-fold cross-validation to identify top-performing models. A key innovation lies in our dynamic weighted voting ensemble (Voting_soft), which integrates multiple classifiers based on model confidence, thereby leveraging the strengths of diverse algorithms. Model performance was rigorously assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) metrics, with ROC and PR curves comparing performance across varying training dataset proportions. Crucially, we employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpretability analysis, providing clinicians with actionable insights into feature contributions.ResultsThrough LightGBM-based correlation analysis and AUC curve determination, fourteen clinical features were identified as optimal predictors. Notably, the CatBoost model achieved superior performance on a 20% test set, while the Extreme Random Tree model demonstrated robustness on a 30% test set. Our dynamic weighted voting ensemble (Voting_soft) outperformed individual models in terms of AUC across both datasets. SHAP analysis revealed that age, triglycerides, sex, and HDL-C were key predictors of DR prevalence, offering clinically meaningful explanations for model decisions.ConclusionsThis study presents a groundbreaking ML-based DR risk prediction system that excels in both accuracy and interpretability. The integration of SHAP analysis not only enhances model transparency but also empowers clinicians with a deeper understanding of diagnostic decision-making, ultimately improving the precision and efficiency of DR screening. Our dynamic voting ensemble approach sets a new benchmark for interpretable, multi-model integration in medical diagnostics."

This represents a major evolution beyond machine learning and large language models (LLM), toward systems capable of planning, executing, and coordinating complex workflows. In contrast to traditional LLMs, which primarily focus on generating and classifying information, agentic AI introduces elements of autonomy, reasoning, and orchestration, while digital twins extend this concept to dynamic virtual representations of patients and laboratory processes, capable of continuous learning, simulation and adaptation. This transition has profound implications for laboratory medicine, a field characterized by high data complexity, multi-omics integration, and stringent operational demands. At the same time, laboratories face growing expectations regarding efficiency, resource stewardship, and value-based healthcare delivery. This article explores both the opportunities and limitations of agentic AI in laboratory medicine, highlighting its potential to move beyond static automation toward autonomous, outcome-driven innovation. It also examines the ethical, interpretability, and governance considerations that must accompany its implementation."

Traditional machine learning and deep learning-based approaches, while effective, often suffer from issues such as limited interpretability, static decision-making, and inadequate generalization across diverse patient data. This research introduces an Agentic-AI Driven Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis (AADR-AI), which leverages intelligent agent-based learning mechanisms to enhance decision-making autonomy, dynamic adaptability, and contextual understanding of retinal fundus images. The novelty lies in incorporating agentic intelligence principles, autonomy, reactivity, and proactivity into DR detection systems, allowing real-time analysis and adaptive feature learning based on patient-specific variations. The proposed AADR-AI framework integrates a multi-agent ensemble of convolutional and transformer-based networks, coordinated through a decision fusion layer for robust classification. Key contributions include improved classification accuracy (up to 96.7%), enhanced model efficiency with reduced computational overhead, and real-time adaptability to varying image qualities and disease progression stages. Extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. This work highlights the transformative potential of agentic AI in medical imaging, paving the way for more autonomous and interpretable clinical decision-support systems."

Early detection of this disease plays a vital role in reducing its complications. However, machine learning and deep learning models often face distrust in medical settings due to their opaque, ""black-box"" nature. The aim of this study was to combine three machine learning algorithms using stacking and voting methods to propose a model for type 2 diabetes detection, and to increase transparency by using the explainability techniques LIME and SHAP to identify important features. This study used medical data from 768 Pima Indians Diabetes samples, including 8 features such as age, BMI, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, skin thickness, pregnancies, and family history. Data preprocessing included mean imputation for missing or zero values, Min-Max normalization, and classification into ""Normal"", ""Prediabetes"", and ""Diabetes"" based on fasting glucose thresholds. Feature selection was performed using Spearman correlation to retain the most relevant variables. A hybrid machine learning model was developed using three base models Neural Network (NN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) with automated hyperparameter tuning. The outputs of these models were combined via stacking using a logistic regression (LR) meta-model and in parallel using a soft voting method. Nested cross-validation (5 outer and 5 inner folds) was applied to prevent data leakage and ensure robust evaluation. Model interpretability was assessed using LIME for local explanations and SHAP for global feature importance. Decision thresholds and influential feature regions were identified, and model calibration and decision curves evaluated clinical reliability. Models performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUROC, Brier Score (1-B), and Expected Calibration Error (1-E). Statistical reliability was assessed using bootstrap resampling to compute 95% confidence intervals, as well as paired tests to compare the hybrid model with the base models and voting ensemble. Based on the evaluation metrics, the stacking ensemble achieved perfect performance for Class 0, with 100% accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and AUROC, alongside the highest calibration metrics (Brier Score: 99.9, ECE: 98.7). The Random Forest model also excelled, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score for Class 0 and Class 2. In contrast, the KNN model consistently underperformed, particularly for Class 0 (F1: 83.3, Precision: 83.3, Recall: 83.3). The Neural Network demonstrated strong recall for Class 0 (100%), while the voting ensemble showed balanced results but was slightly outperformed by the top ensemble methods. Explainable AI analyses using LIME and SHAP revealed that glucose was the most influential predictor for identifying the Pre-diabetes state. Both methods consistently identified a decision band between 0.35 and 0.47 (corresponding to 100-125 mg/dL) as the transition zone between ""Normal"" and ""Prediabetes"", confirming the model's alignment with WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria. The stacking model achieved perfect performance and superior calibration, outperforming all other models in type 2 diabetes prediction and classification. Explainability techniques (LIME and SHAP) identified glucose level, body mass index, and blood pressure as key predictive factors. This approach provides an accurate and interpretable tool for clinical decision support in healthcare systems."
