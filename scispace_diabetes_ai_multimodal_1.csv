Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions.

Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population. ","This study proposes a multimodal deep learning architecture that integrates continuous glucose monitoring data with physiological context from health records to predict interstitial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients with high accuracy (up to 96.7%) and low error (MAPE 6-26 mg/dL)."

Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM.

A cross-sectional study. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2020 were analyzed, involving 8249 participants categorized into healthy controls (n = 6830), diabetes without retinopathy (n = 918), and DR (n = 501). Immunometabolic indices reflecting insulin resistance, inflammation, and lipid metabolism were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed associations with DR, and Bayesian kernel machine regression analyzed nonlinear interactions. Eight ML models, including ensemble methods, were developed to predict DR risk, with feature importance determined by SHapley Additive exPlanations. The primary outcome was DR status, classified according to the ETDRS criteria from fundus photography. Key immunometabolic indices, notably Frailty Index (FRAILTY) and fasting serum insulin (FSI), were significantly associated with increased DR risk, whereas the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS) showed a protective effect. Bayesian kernel machine regression highlighted complex interactions among indices. Machine learning models achieved high predictive accuracy, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM (area under the curve > 0.9).

Notably, usage has expanded to predict an individual’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes. A scoping review of 40 studies by Mohsen et al. shows that while most studies used unimodal AI models, multimodal approaches were superior because they integrate multiple types of data. However, creating multimodal models and determining model performance are challenging tasks given the multi-factored nature of diabetes. For both unimodal and multimodal models, there are also concerns of bias with the lack of external validations and representation of race, age, and gender in training data. The barriers in data quality and evaluation standardization are ripe areas for developing new technologies, especially for entrepreneurs and innovators. Collaboration amongst providers, entrepreneurs, and researchers must be prioritized to ensure that AI in diabetes care is providing quality and equitable patient care.

ML is becoming increasingly used to diagnose complications of diabetes based on these types of datasets. In this article, we review the current status, barriers to progress, and future prospects for using ML to diagnose seven complications of diabetes, including five traditional complications, one set of other systemic complications, and one prediction that can result in favorable or unfavorable outcomes. The complications include (1) diabetic retinopathy, (2) diabetic nephropathy, (3) peripheral neuropathy, (4) autonomic neuropathy, (5) diabetic foot ulcers, and (6) other systemic complications. The prediction is for outcomes in hospitalized patients with diabetes. ML for these purposes is in its infancy, as evidenced by only a limited number of products having received regulatory clearance at this time. However, as multicenter reference datasets become available, it will become possible to train algorithms on increasingly larger and more complex datasets and patterns so that diagnoses and predictions will become increasingly accurate. The use of novel choices of images and imaging technologies will contribute to progress in this field.

World Health Organization predicts the prevalence of diabetes to increase substantially in the future, leading to an increasing pressure on public health services. In the context of smart healthcare, DR screening has been widely adopted by utilizing fundus imaging with manual input. In this chapter, we review the potential of artificial intelligence enabled automated screening for the detection and classification of DR in the context of the National Health Service. We propose an integrated multimodal approach to enable the combination of manual (through human graders) and automated DR screening. Furthermore, we discuss how this multimodal approach can be enhanced by the integration of additional modalities such as optical coherence tomography. Artificial intelligence in that setting can complement and upskill human graders by acting in an assistive way rather than replacing their role.","The potential of artificial intelligence enabled automated screening for the detection and classification of diabetes in the context of the National Health Service is reviewed and an integrated multimodal approach to enable the combination of manual (through human graders) and automated DR screening is proposed."

The recent increase in wearable devices for diabetes care, and in particular the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), generates large datasets and associated cybersecurity challenges. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify CGM data at an individual level by using standard machine learning techniques.


METHODS
The publicly available REPLACE-BG dataset containing 226 adult participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) wearing CGM over 6 months was used. A support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier aiming to determine if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual participant was trained and tested for each of the subjects in the dataset. To generate the feature vector used for classification, 12 standard glycaemic metrics were selected and evaluated at different time periods of the day (24h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, dinner). Different window lengths of CGM data (3, 7, 15, and 30 days) were chosen to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. A recursive feature selection method was employed to select the minimum subset of features that did not significantly degrade performance.


RESULTS
A total of 40 features were generated as a result of evaluating the glycemic metrics over the selected time periods (24h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, dinner). A window length of 15 days was found to perform the best in terms of accuracy (86.8±12.8%) and F1 score (0.86±0.16). The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 85.7±19.5% and 87.9±17.5%, respectively. Through recursive feature selection, a subset of 11 features was shown to perform similarly to the 40 features.


CONCLUSION
It is possible to determine with a relatively high accuracy if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual. The proposed approach can be used as a digital CGM 'fingerprint' or for detecting glycaemic changes within an individual, for example during intercurrent illness.","It is demonstrated that it is possible to identify CGM data at an individual level by using standard machine learning techniques and can be used as a digital CGM 'fingerprint' or for detecting glycaemic changes within an individual, for example during intercurrent illness."

Overall, 26% of the 37 million Americans with diabetes suffer from DR, and 5% of people with diabetes suffer from vision-threatening DR. DR is a heterogeneous disease; thus, it is essential to acknowledge this diversity as we advance toward precision medicine. The current classification for DR primarily focuses on the microvascular component of disease progression, which does not fully capture the heterogeneity of disease etiology in different patients. Further, researchers in the field have suggested renewed interest in improving diagnosis and treatment modalities for personalized care in DR management. Moreover, genetic factors, lifestyle, and environmental variation strongly affect the disease outcome. It is important to emphasize that various ocular and peripheral biomarkers, along with imaging techniques, significantly influence the diagnosis of DR. Therefore, in this review, we explore the heterogeneity of DR, genetic variations or polymorphism, lifestyle and environmental factors, and how these factors may affect the development of precision medicine for DR. First, we provide a rationale for the necessity of a multifaceted understanding of disease etiology. Next, we discuss different aspects of DR diagnosis, emphasizing the need for further stratification of patient populations to facilitate personalized treatment. We then discuss different genetics, race, sex, lifestyle, and environmental factors that could help personalize treatments for DR.

Community vision screenings may play an important role, especially in communities at higher risk for diabetes. To address the need for increased DR detection and referrals, we evaluated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for screening DR. Patient images of 124 eyes were obtained using a 45° Canon Non-Mydriatic CR-2 Plus AF retinal camera in the Department of Endocrinology Clinic (Newark, NJ) and in a community screening event (Newark, NJ). Images were initially classified by an onsite grader and uploaded for analysis by EyeArt, a cloud-based AI software developed by Eyenuk (California, USA). The images were also graded by an off-site retina specialist. Using Fleiss kappa analysis, a correlation was investigated between the three grading systems, the AI, onsite grader, and a US board-certified retina specialist, for a diagnosis of DR and referral pattern. The EyeArt results, onsite grader, and the retina specialist had a 79% overall agreement on the diagnosis of DR: 86 eyes with full agreement, 37 eyes with agreement between two graders, 1 eye with full disagreement. The kappa value for concordance on a diagnosis was 0.69 (95% CI 0.61–0.77), indicating substantial agreement. Referral patterns by EyeArt, the onsite grader, and the ophthalmologist had an 85% overall agreement: 96 eyes with full agreement, 28 eyes with disagreement. The kappa value for concordance on “whether to refer” was 0.70 (95% CI 0.60–0.80), indicating substantial agreement.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data in a cohort of 537 adults with type 1 diabetes we predicted diabetes complications emerging during a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Prediction models were computed first with clinical risk factors at baseline (17 measures) and then with clinical risk factors and blood-derived metabolomics and lipidomics data (965 molecular features) at baseline. Participants were first classified into two groups: type 1 diabetes stable (n=195) or type 1 diabetes with progression to diabetes complications (n=190). Furthermore, progression of diabetic kidney disease (≥30% decline in eGFR; n=79) and diabetic retinopathy (mild, moderate or severe; n=111) were predicted in two complication-specific models. Models were compared by 5-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. The Shapley additive explanations algorithm was used for feature selection and for interpreting the models. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score were used to evaluate clinical utility. 

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 79 (21 %) of the participants (mean+-SD: age 54.8 +- 13.7 years) progressed in diabetic kidney disease and 111 (29 %) of the participants progressed to diabetic retinopathy.

The predictive panel composition was: albuminuria, retinopathy, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c, and six metabolites (five identified as ribitol, ribonic acid, myo-inositol, 2,4- and 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acids).
Models for diabetic retinopathy progression were less predictive with clinical risk predictors at, AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.754;0.958) and with omics included at AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.781;0.996) curve. The final retinopathy-panel included: hemoglobin A1c, albuminuria, mild degree of retinopathy, and seven metabolites, including one ceramide and the 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid). 

CONCLUSIONS: Here we demonstrate the application of machine learning to effectively predict five-year progression of complications, in particular diabetic kidney disease, using a panel of known clinical risk factors in combination with blood small molecules. Further replication of this machine learning tool in a real-world context or a clinical trial will facilitate its implementation in the clinic.","In this paper, the authors applied machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of future progression to diabetes complications, including diabetic kidney disease (≥30% decline in eGFR) and diabetic retinopathy (mild, moderate or severe) during a median follow-up of 5.4 years."

Recent research highlights the growing focus on digital biomarkers in diabetes management, with innovations in computational frameworks and noninvasive monitoring techniques using personalized glucose metrics. However, they predominantly focus on insulin dosing and specific glucose values, or with limited attention given to overall glycemic control. This leaves a gap in expanding the scope of digital biomarkers for overall glycemic control in diabetes management. To address such a research gap, we propose GluMarker -- an end-to-end framework for modeling digital biomarkers using broader factors sources to predict glycemic control. Through the assessment and refinement of various machine learning baselines, GluMarker achieves state-of-the-art on Anderson's dataset in predicting next-day glycemic control. Moreover, our research identifies key digital biomarkers for the next day's glycemic control prediction. These identified biomarkers are instrumental in illuminating the daily factors that influence glycemic management, offering vital insights for diabetes care.","GluMarker is a novel framework for modeling digital biomarkers to predict glycemic control, addressing the gap in existing solutions.

Genomic information is used to discover heritable risk factors or features applied in precision medicine to guide treatment decisions. This information is fixed in time for any individual. By contrast, periodically updated medical records and especially the use of real-time health-sensing devices provide accurate tracking of health and disease over time. The technological trend toward enabling consumer electronics with capabilities for sensing physiological signals, such as motion, heart rate, or blood sugar levels, is creating a vast data space. If properly processed, these real-time data can fundamentally change research paradigms and transform the clinical practice.However, more data are not always better. With the increased data volume and complexity, the challenge becomes how to extract information relevant to the condition of a particular patient at a particular time. The classic pathway of medical logic of data → information → decision becomes difficult to follow with the traditional methods of biostatistics. New approaches are needed and are fortunately available, ranging from modeling, simulation, and optimal control methods, to rapidly developing data science tools.Before continuing further, we should emphasize that, arguably, diabetes mellitus is the best quantified human condition. In the past 40 years, metabolic monitoring technologies have progressed from occasional assessment of average glycemia via glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), to blood glucose monitoring a few times a day, to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) producing data points every few minutes—time series tracking the dynamics of the metabolic system. The high temporal resolution of CGM data has enabled advanced treatments such as decision support assisting insulin injection or oral medication, or automated closed-loop control known as the ""artificial pancreas."" Sophisticated metabolic models and simulators are available as well.In this article, we review the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We structured the results of this review in three sections: (1) closed-loop control, or automated insulin delivery (AID), which appears to be the term preferred recently; (2) decision-support systems (DSS), particularly those that use contemporary methods such as artificial intelligence, and (3) data acquisition, engineering, analytics, and visualization, which are all data science tools increasingly applied to the retrieval of electronic medical records (EMR) and real-time disease-tracking information.Key Articles ReviewedConsensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M, Nimri R, Bergenstal RM, Barnard-Kelly K, Danne T, Hovorka R, Kovatchev BP, Messer LH, Parkin CG, Ambler-Osborn L, Amiel SA, Bally L, Beck RW, Biester S, Biester T, Blanchette JE, Bosi E, Boughton CK, Breton MD, Brown SA, Buckingham BA, Cai A, Carlson AL, Castle JR, Choudhary P, Close KL, Cobelli C, Criego AB, Davis E, de Beaufort C, de Bock MI, DeSalvo DJ, DeVries JH, Dovc K, Doyle FJ 3rd, Ekhlaspour L, Shvalb NF, Forlenza GP, Gallen G, Garg SK, Gershenoff DC, Gonder-Frederick LA, Haidar A, Hartnell S, Heinemann L, Heller S, Hirsch IB, Hood KK, Isaacs D, Klonoff DC, Kordonouri O, Kowalski A, Laffel L, Lawton J, Lal RA, Leelarathna L, Maahs DM, Murphy HR, Nørgaard K, O'Neal D, Oser S, Oser T, Renard E, Riddell MC, Rodbard D, Russell SJ, Schatz DA, Shah VN, Sherr JL, Simonson GD, Wadwa RP, Ward C, Weinzimer SA, Wilmot EG, Battelino TEndoc Rev2023;

8:e47592Closed-Loop Control of Diabetes, or AIDA PubMed search on artificial pancreas, or AID, or closed loop in diabetes identified 397 results for the period of July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. From these, we selected 40 articles of interest (e.g., ∼10%) for inclusion in the reference list of this article. Five of these articles are reviewed in more detail in the following pages (1–5). It is worth noting that four of them are published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (impact factor, 176.082) (2–5) and signify substantial clinical trials by different research groups. Publication of these studies in such high-ranking journals was rare until recently, and we believe the AID literature this past year has achieved a new record in terms of its impact on medical science.A number of other notable studies were published as well (6–15) that tested various AID systems in diverse conditions, such as the inpatient setting (7), with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (9,10), with long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D) with hypoglycemia unawareness (12), or in very young children (14). The large randomized trials (> 100 participants) used traditional designs to reconfirm the advantages of hybrid closed loop over conventional therapy (6,15). Meta-analyses (16–18) and comprehensive reviews (19–23) solidified AID as an advanced, effective, and cost-effective (24) treatment of T1D and T2D. International consortiums published clinical guidelines for the use of AID in the clinical practice (1,25–27). And several studies reported real-life data for various AID systems (28–35), with one study reporting data for nearly 20,000 AID users (28).The investigation of using ultra-rapid-acting insulin has continued with clinical trials comparing faster insulin aspart with standard insulin aspart (36–38) and yielding mixed results—in some studies no effect was shown (36), in others ultra-rapid insulin contributed to better control (38). A new study using a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor in addition to insulin in people with T1D confirmed previous results and found that ""empagliflozin at 2.5 and 5 mg increased time in range during hybrid closed-loop therapy by 11–13 percentage points compared with placebo in those who otherwise were unable to attain glycemic targets"" (39). And last, but not least, a study on AID performance during swimming was published, which also presents interesting data about the interdevice (sensor–pump) communication in water (40).Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M1,2*, Nimri R1,2*, Bergenstal RM3, Barnard-Kelly K4, Danne T5, Hovorka R6, Kovatchev BP7, Messer LH8, Parkin CG9, Ambler-Osborn L10, Amiel SA11, Bally L12, Beck RW13, Biester S5, Biester T5, Blanchette JE14,15, Bosi E16, Boughton CK17, Breton MD7, Brown SA7,18, Buckingham BA19, Cai A20, Carlson AL3, Castle JR21, Choudhary P22, Close KL20, Cobelli C23, Criego AB3, Davis E24, de Beaufort C25, de Bock MI26, DeSalvo DJ27, DeVries JH28, Dovc K29, Doyle FJ 3rd30, Ekhlaspour L31, Shvalb NF1, Forlenza GP8, Gallen G11, Garg SK8, Gershenoff DC3, Gonder-Frederick LA7, Haidar A32, Hartnell S33, Heinemann L34, Heller S35, Hirsch IB36, Hood KK37, Isaacs D38, Klonoff DC39, Kordonouri O5, Kowalski A40, Laffel L10, Lawton J41, Lal RA42, Leelarathna L43, Maahs DM19, Murphy HR44, Nørgaard K45, O'Neal D46, Oser S47, Oser T47, Renard E48, Riddell MC49, Rodbard D50, Russell SJ51, Schatz DA52, Shah VN8, Sherr JL53, Simonson GD3, Wadwa RP8, Ward C54, Weinzimer SA53, Wilmot EG55,56, Battelino T29*Contributed equally to the manuscript and are both corresponding authors 1The Jesse Z and Sara Lea Shafer Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center for Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel; 2Sacker Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; 3International Diabetes Center, HealthPartners Institute, Minneapolis, MN; 4Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK; 5AUF DER BULT, Diabetes-Center for Children and Adolescents, Endocrinology and General Paediatrics, Hannover, Germany; 6Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; 7Center for Diabetes Technology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 8Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver—Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 9CGParkin Communications, Inc., Henderson, NV; 10Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; 11Department of Diabetes, King's College London, London, UK; 12Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 13Jaeb Center for Health Research Foundation, Inc., Tampa, FL; 14College of Nursing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; 15Center for Diabetes and Obesity, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; 16Diabetes Research Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital and San Raffaele Vita Salute University, Milan, Italy; 17Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Cambridge, UK; 18Division of Endocrinology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 19Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 20The diaTribe Foundation/Close Concerns, San Diego, CA; 21Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; 22Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; 23Department of Woman and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; 24Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Australia; 25Diabetes & Endocrine Care Clinique Pédiatrique DECCP/Centre Hospitalier Luxembourg, and Faculty of Sciences, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzette, GD Luxembourg/Department of Paediatrics, UZ-VUB, Brussels, Belgium; 26Department of Paediatrics, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand; 27Division of Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX ; 28Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Internal Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 29Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, UMC - University Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; 30Harvard John A.

Numerous randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have shown that the use of AID systems is safe and effective in helping individuals with diabetes achieve long-term glycemic goals while reducing hypoglycemia risk. AID systems have thus become an integral part of diabetes management, but recommendations for using AID systems in clinical settings have been lacking.MethodsIn 2021, an international panel of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in AID was organized by the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress to develop clinical guidelines for initiating AID for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The nine working groups addressed evolution of AID, clinical evidence, determining the target population for AID use, initiation of AID, education and training, utilization of AID, AID data reporting, psychological issues/user perspective, and the future of AID. The full panel voted on the working group recommendations, which became the basis of the consensus recommendations.ResultsThe report provides needed guidance to clinicians who are interested in using AID and (2) serves as a comprehensive review of evidence for payers to consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage.ConclusionsGuided recommendations are critical for AID success and acceptance, and all clinicians who treat diabetes need to become familiar with the available systems to eliminate disparities in diabetes quality of care. A comprehensive listing of the evidence payers should consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage is also provided.CommentsThese consensus recommendations published in Endocrine Reviews present the collective opinion of a select group of experts in AID (aka closed-loop control of diabetes) regarding the use of AID systems in clinical practice. This article is a highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to be introduced to the current technological and clinical state of AID systems, with a peek into their future as well.Following a review of the closed-loop field and an account of the evidence-based advantages of AID systems over other T1D therapies, the guidelines continue with sections explaining the different types of AID algorithms and the difference between hybrid and fully automated AID systems (HCL and FCL), the latter being defined as an AID system that does not require user involvement to function.The following are major takeaways from these consensus recommendations. (1) Evidence suggests that AID systems should be considered as a treatment option for all people with T1D to improve glycemic control, regardless of age, hypoglycemia awareness, pregnancy, or certain comorbidities. (2) To date, all clinically available systems are ""hybrid,"" meaning they require specific diabetes managements skills such as carbohydrate counting, so training and support for users and health-care providers are essential. (3) Interoperability between system components (e.g., sensors, algorithms, and insulin pumps) is important for the proliferation of these new technologies, but to a large extent this depends on the industry. (4) Early initiation of diabetes technologies in newly diagnosed T1D has been shown to improve and sustain long-term glycemic control, so early AID system initiation is encouraged. (5) The transition to an AID system should be individualized, and the initial settings of an AID system should be selected according to personal glycemic targets, based on recently acquired continuous glucose monitor (CGM) metrics. (6) Unified reporting of AID data is suggested, using clinically important glucose (e.g., time-in-range) and insulin (e.g., total daily insulin) metrics, plus the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) usually aggregated over 14 days, which has become a standardized way to visualize CGM data. (7) Psychological issues related to the use of AID systems should be discussed and documented in the context of discontinuation or noncompliance with AID treatment.In conclusion, the consensus recommendations map future directions for AID development, including FCL, use of data science methods to analyze and comprehend the vast amounts of CGM and insulin-delivery data collected by AID systems, and learning adaptive AID algorithms that continually tailor the treatment to the changing behavior and physiology of their users. The consensus strongly recommends that all payers (government and private) should reimburse for AID systems as well as for AID education and training to support the management of people with T1D.Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery in Type 1 DiabetesBurnside MJ1,3, Lewis DM11, Crocket HR4, Meier RA1, Williman JA2, Sanders OJ1,3, Jefferies CA6,7, Faherty AM6, Paul RG5, Lever CS5, Price SKJ5, Frewen CM8, Jones SD8, Gunn TC10, Lampey C6, Wheeler BJ8,9, de Bock MI1,31Departments of Pediatrics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 2Department of Population Health, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 3Department of Pediatrics, Canterbury District Health Board Christchurch, New Zealand; 4Te Huataki Waiora School of Health, Sport and Human Performance, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; 5Waikato Regional Diabetes Service, Waikato District Health Board, Hamilton, New Zealand; 6Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Starship Children's Health, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 7Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 8Department of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 9Pediatric Department, Southern District Health Board, Dunedin, New Zealand; 10Nightscout New Zealand, Hamilton, New Zealand; 11OpenAPS, Seattle, WAN Engl J Med 2022;387:869–881This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) use open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, and more data are needed on the efficacy and safety of these system.MethodsIn this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, patients with T1D were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use an open-source AID system or a sensor-augmented insulin pump (control). The participants included both children (defined as 7–15 years of age) and adults (defined as 16–70 years of age). A modified version of AndroidAPS 2.8 (with a standard OpenAPS 0.7.0 algorithm) paired with a preproduction DANA-i insulin pump and Dexcom G6 CGM, which has an Android smartphone application as the user interface, was used as the AID system. The primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) between days 155 and 168, the final 2 weeks of the trial.ResultsA total of 97 patients (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization, 44 to open-source AID and 53 to the control group. At 24 weeks, the mean time in the target range increased from 61.2% ± 12.3% SD to 71.2% ± 12.1% SD in the AID group and decreased from 57.7% ± 14.3% SD to 54.5% ± 16.0% SD in the control group (adjusted difference, 14 percentage points [95% CI, 9.2–18.8], P < 0.001), with no treatment effect according to age (P = 0.56). Participants in the AID group spent 3 hours and 21 minutes more in the target range per day compared with in the control group. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in either group. Two patients in the AID group withdrew from the trial owing to connectivity issues.ConclusionsThe use of an open-source AID system in children and adults with T1D resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time in the target glucose range compared with the use of a sensor-augmented insulin pump.CommentsOpen-source AID (or Do-it-yourself Loop) algorithms have been available since before commercial AID systems appeared on the market. Typically, the handling of these open-source algorithms required above-average engineering and computer skills. The lack of clinical trials of open-source AID was also a reason these systems to remain unregulated (i.e., not formally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] or other regulatory agencies). This article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine aims to counter these shortcomings by presenting a randomized-controlled trial of one open-source algorithm running on a smartphone.The trial achieved results that are very similar to those in trials published to date for commercial AID systems: for instance, a 14-percentage-point increase in time in range up to 71%, a reduction of HbA1c of 0.5 percentage points, and a relatively low risk for hypoglycemia. The editorial that accompanied the article labeled the trial a ""path toward expanding treatment options for diabetes"" (41). As expected there were opposing opinions that emphasized the lack of regulatory approval of open-source AID: ""Unapproved products and algorithms raise the undesirable prospect of clinical harm and litigation"" (42). After the publication of this article, the latter argument became less critical owing to the FDA approval in January 2023 of Tidepool Loop—an FDA-regulated version of Loop, to be available in the iOS App Store, which is intended to work with commercially available insulin pumps and CGMs.This ATTD Yearbook article takes a neutral view on the open-source AID controversy: evidence has shown that these systems are not superior to commercial devices, and their more flexible customization features do not necessarily result in improved glycemic control. However, as noted in the previously mentioned editorial (41), open-source AID offers one more path toward expanding the treatment options for insulin-requiring diabetes, which can be appealing to a perhaps select group of people who are confident in their diabetes-management skills.Trial of Hybrid Closed-Loop Control in Young Children with Type 1 DiabetesWadwa RP1, Reed ZW2, Buckingham BA3, DeBoer MD5, Ekhlaspour L4, Forlenza GP1, Schoelwer M5, Lum J2, Kollman C2, Beck RW2, Breton MD5, for the PEDAP Trial Study Group1Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 2Jaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, FL; 3Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 4Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University of California, San Francisco, CA; 5University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology, Charlottesville, VAN Engl J Med 2023;388:991–1001This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.Closed-loop control systems of insulin delivery may improve glycemic outcomes in young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the efficacy and safety of initiating a closed-loop s ","This article reviews the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 2022 to June 2023, focusing on closed-loop control, artificial intelligence-based decision-support systems, and data science.

A number of studies documented the benefits of CGM (3–6) and predicted its future as a component of decision support (DS) and closed‐loop (CL) systems (7–10). The advantage of CGM is the frequent (e.g., every 5 minutes) estimation of glucose levels, which generates large amounts of data and allows accurate reconstruction of the time course of glycemic fluctuations of a person. The “curse” of CGM is the frequent estimation of glucose levels, which generates large amounts of data that are difficult to interpret without clever DS or CL systems (11,12).Regularly published reviews explain how DS systems digest in a meaningful way the vast amounts of CGM and insulin delivery information prior to serving it to patients and their healthcare providers, and provide evidence for their efficacy (13–15). While the classic CGM data interpretation tool is the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) report incorporated in the data reports of several CGM devices (16), DS are beginning to include new data science methods, such as CGM pattern classification and data‐driven methods for prediction of blood glucose dynamics (17,18), classification of therapeutic strategies (19), as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced machine‐learning applications (20,21). A multitude of Smartphone apps connect to glucose monitoring devices and offer actionable data interpretation, as well as advice regarding diet, exercise, bolus calculation, or insulin dosing. The choices are many and the DS field continues to grow rapidly.The first hybrid CL system approved in 2016 for clinical use was the Medtronic 670G, which regulated automatically the pump's basal rate but did not administer insulin boluses. The state of CL progress prior to 2019 was documented by systematic reviews and meta‐analyses by high‐impact journals, including Lancet Diabetes Endocrinology (22), Nature Reviews Endocrinology (23), British Medical Journal (24), and Metabolism (25), which confirmed the efficacy of the CL for diabetes control (22,24,25). Thereafter, several longer‐term randomized trials were reported, assessing the efficacy of CL systems over 3 months, or more: (i) a 3‐month trial of CL implemented on a mobile phone and compared to sensor-augmented pump (SAP) resulted in 4.8% improvement in the time within 70–180 mg/dL and 1.7% improvement in the time < 70 mg/dL (26); (ii) a 12‐week trial reported a 10.8% improvement in the time within 70–180 mg/dL and 0.8% improvement in the time < 70 mg/dL (27); (iii) another 12‐week trial reported 9.2% and 2.4% improvement, respectively, but with five episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the CLC group (28), and (iv) the 6‐month multicenter randomized Protocol 3 of the International Diabetes Closed‐Loop (iDCL) Trial, which compared Control‐IQ to SAP and reported 11% increase in the time in the target range of 70–180 mg/dL and simultaneous reduction in the time < 70 mg/dL by 0.9% (29), without occurrence of severe hypoglycemia. This study led to the FDA approval of Control‐IQ for clinical use in 2019 (30).Today, after years of development and testing of system components and algorithms, closed‐loop control of diabetes, known as the “artificial pancreas,” is a clinical reality. Two CL systems—Medtronic's 670G/770G and Tandem's Control‐IQ—have FDA clearance for clinical use in the United States and CE mark for clinical use in Europe. Another two systems—Medtronic 780G and CamAPS FX—received CE mark for use in European countries. These systems are at different stages of their clinical implementation: while 670G/770G and Control‐IQ already have hundreds of thousands of users around the world, 780G and CamAPS FX are making their first strides in real‐life application. Several other systems have passed extensive testing and are along their ways to regulatory approval, including Omnipod 5, Diabeloop, Tidepool Loop, and iLet (in two configurations—insulin only and insulin plus glucagon, the latter still in pilot‐feasibility stages). With the increasing clinical use of CL systems, real‐life data began to emerge, specifically from the use of the first CL—the MiniMed 670G (31–36), revealing improved glycemic control and quality of life (33,34), but also frequent discontinuation of system use due to suboptimal user experience (35–36).In this article, we will cover advanced DS systems, including some that are based on cutting‐edge AI, large‐scale CL pivotal trials and real‐life data, as well as small studies testing faster‐insulin or multi‐hormone CL systems.Key Articles Reviewed for the ArticleInsulin Dose

1380–1384This manuscript is also discussed in article on Diabetes Technology and Therapy in the Pediatric Age Group, page XXAbstractDespite the increasing adoption of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices, the majority of people with type 1 diabetes do not achieve their glycemic goals. It is possible that this is related to a lack of expertise or inadequate time for clinicians to analyze complex sensor‐augmented pump data. The authors tested whether frequent insulin dose adjustments guided by an automated artificial intelligence–based decision support system (AI‐DSS) is as effective and safe as those guided by physicians in controlling glucose levels. ADVICE4U was a 6‐month, multicenter, multinational, parallel, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial in 108 participants with type 1 diabetes, aged 10–21 years and using insulin pump therapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive remote insulin dose adjustment every 3 weeks guided by either an AI‐DSS, (AI‐DSS arm, n=54) or by physicians (physician arm, n=54). The results for the primary efficacy measure, which was the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L]) in the AI‐DSS arm, were statistically noninferior to those in the physician arm (50.2±11.1% versus 51.6±11.3%, respectively, P<1×10–7). The percentage of readings below 54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) within the AI‐DSS arm was statistically noninferior to that in the physician arm (1.3±1.4% versus 1.0±0.9%, respectively, P<0.0001). Within the physician arm, three severe adverse events related to diabetes (two severe hypoglycemia, one diabetic ketoacidosis) were reported, while none were reported in the AI‐DSS arm.The authors concluded that the use of an automated decision support tool for optimizing insulin pump settings was noninferior to intensive insulin titration provided by physicians from specialized academic diabetes centers.CommentIn the present manuscript, the authors report the result of a 6‐month study designed to test an artificial intelligence decision support system (AI‐DSS) developed to help healthcare providers (HCPs) coping with the need to optimize insulin dosing of people with type 1 diabetes using pumps and continuous glucose sensor. The algorithm ADVICE4U was tested in a multicenter, multinational prospective randomized trial with four centers in the United States, two centers in Europe, and one center in Israel. A challenging age group of 108 youths aged 10–21 were enrolled to the study and were divided into two groups. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive remote insulin dose adjustment every 3 weeks and were guided by either an AI‐DSS or by physicians. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range (70–180 mg/dL). The percent of time in the desired range in the ADVICE4U arm was not inferior to that of the physician arm. The authors also used the percent of time below 54 mg/dL as a safety parameter, and again the ADVIC4U arm was not inferior to the physician arm.The finding that intensive titration achieved by AI‐DSS is not inferior to that achieved by a physician from a specialized academic center might have important implications. Facing the reality of a shortage of expert endocrinologists around the globe and the constant increment in the number of people with diabetes, AI‐DSS algorithms might be able to help HCPs who are not in academic centers and primary care physicians to intensively treat people with diabetes and reach the level of care similar to that of physicians in specialized academic diabetes centers. Indeed, such studies should be conducted in primary care facilities with insulin‐treated patients who are also using multiple daily injection (MDI) and sensors, and MDI and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG).An Artificial Intelligence Decision Support System for the Management of Type 1 DiabetesTyler NS1, Mosquera‐Lopez CM1, Wilson LM2, Dodier RH1, Branigan D2, Gabo VB2, Guillot FH2, Hilts WW1, El Youssef J2, Castle JR2, Jacobs PG11Artificial Intelligence for Medical Systems (AIMS) Lab, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; 2Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, ORNat Metab 2020;2: 612–619AbstractType 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and insulin depletion. Multiple injections of long‐acting basal and short‐acting bolus insulin, so‐called multiple daily injections (MDI), are used by over 40% of people with T1D to manage their glucose. Errors in dosing can lead to life‐threatening hypoglycemia events (<70 mg/dL–1) and hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL–1), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine‐learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. In this study, the authors report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. They employ a unique virtual platform to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k‐nearest neighbors decision support system (KNN‐DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN‐DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board‐certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real‐world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter‐physician‐recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter‐physician agreement (41%–45%). After 12 weeks of KNN‐DSS use, a substantial improvement in glycemic outcomes was indicated, with evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies performed with in silico benchmarking using a platform accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The data indicate that the KNN‐DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycemic outcomes and prevent life‐threatening complications in people with T1D.CommentIn the present manuscript, Tyler and colleagues have described an artificial intelligence- (AI-) based decision support system (DSS) they have developed to treat adults with type 1 diabetes who use multiple daily injections and continuous glucose sensors. They developed an algorithm (k‐nearest neighbors decision support system [KMM‐DSS]) to identify causes of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations on a weekly basis. They report that they achieved an overall agreement with a board‐certified endocrinologist of 67.9%, and delivered safe recommendations per endocrinologist review. In silico benchmarking indicates substantial improvement in glycemic outcome after 12 weeks of the use of their algorithm.With the lack of expert endocrinologists to cope with the constant increment in the number of people with diabetes around the globe, the need for AI‐based DSS that will serve both healthcare providers and people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes is obvious. Many apps with sophisticated algorithms have been produced over the last few years to try and fill in that “need.” However, most of them were never clinically tested.Despite the fact that the present study is important, it has several limitations. The KMM‐DSS was validated by only a single endocrinologist of a single center and was not yet clinically tested. The KMM‐DSS seems promising and indeed deserves to be tested in a prospective randomized clinical study of appropriate duration. The study should recruit people with diabetes (PwD) using MDI and sensors, and possibly also patients using MDI and SMBG, and should compare an arm of PwD who are getting their advice weekly from the algorithm to an arm of PwD who are getting their advice from an expert physician. Time in range and time below 54 mg/dL should be the end points and the study should be powered to be able to answer the questions: Can that specific algorithm be used safely? Is it effective? Many more questions related to patient outcome will also need to be answered.DIABEO System Combining a Mobile App Software with and without Telemonitoring Versus Standard Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Diabetes Patients Poorly Controlled with a Basal‐Bolus Insulin RegimenFranc S1, Hanaire H2, Benhamou PY3, Schaepelynck P4, Catargi B5, Farret A6, Fontaine P7, Guerci B8, Reznik Y9, Jeandidier N10, Penfornis A2,11, Borot S12, Chaillous L13, Serusclat P14, Kherbachi Y15, d'Orsay G16, Detournay B17, Simon P18, Charpentier G11Department of Diabetes, Sud‐Francilien Hospital, Corbeil‐Essonnes, and Centre d'étude et de Recherche pour l'Intensification du Traitement du Diabète (CERITD), Evry, France; 2Department of Diabetology, Metabolic Diseases and Nutrition, CHU Toulouse, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France; 3Department of Diabetology, Pôle DigiDune, University Hospital, Grenoble, France; 4Department of Nutrition‐Endocrinology‐Metabolic Disorders, Marseille University Hospital, Sainte Marguerite Hospital, Marseille, France; 5Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France; 6Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition, University Hospital, Montpellier, France; 7Department of Diabetology, University Hospital, Lille, France; 8Endocrinology‐Diabetes Care Unit, University of Lorraine, Vandoeuvre Lès Nancy, France; 9Department of Endocrinology, University of Caen Côte de Nacre Regional Hospital Center, Caen, France; 10Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition, CHU of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; 11University Paris‐Sud, University Paris‐Sud, Orsay, France; 12Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Jean Minjoz, Service d'Endocrinologie‐Métabolisme et Diabétologie‐Nutrition, Besançon, France; 13CHU de Nantes–Hospital Laennec, Saint‐Herblain, France; 14Endocrinology, Diabetology and Nutrition, Clinique Portes du Sud, Venissieux, France; 15Sanofi‐Diabetes, Gentilly, France; 16Voluntis, Suresnes, France; 17CEMKA‐EVAL, Bourg‐la‐Reine, France; 18National Association of Telemedicine, Evry, FranceDiabetes Technol Ther 2020;22: 904–911This manuscript is also discussed in article on Using Digital Health Technology to Prevent and Treat Disease, page XXBackgroundThe DIABEO system (DS) is a telemedicine solution that combines a mobile app for patients with a web portal for healthcare providers. DS allows real‐time monitoring of basal‐bolus insulin therapy as well as therapeutic decision‐making, integrating both basal and bolus dose calculation. Real‐life studies have shown a very low rate of use of mobile health applications by patients. Therefore, we conducted a large randomized controlled trial study to investigate the efficacy of DS in conditions close to real life (TELESAGE study).MethodsTELESAGE was a multicenter, randomized, open study with three parallel arms: arm 1 (standard care), arm 2 (DIABEO alone), and arm 3 (DIABEO+telemonitoring by trained nurses). The primary outcome assessed the reduction in HbA1c levels after a 12‐month follow‐up.ResultsSix hundred sixty‐five patients were included in the study. Participants who used DIABEO once or more times a day (DIABEO users) showed a significant and meaningful reduction of HbA1c versus standard care after a 12‐month follow‐up: mean difference − 0.41% for arm 2–arm 1 (P=0.001) and −0.51% for arm 3–arm 1 (P≤0.001). DIABEO users included 25.1% of participants in arm 2 and 37.6% in arm 3. In the intention‐to‐treat population, HbA1c changes and incidence of hypoglycemia were comparable between arms.ConclusionsA clinical and statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels was found in those patients who used DIABEO at least once a day.CommentIn the present study, the authors failed to show a meaningful benefit in HbA1c reduction using DIABEO, a mobile app for patients with a web portal for healthcare providers, by means of intention‐to‐treat analysis. They did show a significant reduction in HbA1c in the intervention arms compared to the arm of participants treated with the standard of care when only participants who actually used DIABEO once or twice daily were included in their analysis. The authors report that DIABEO was used only in 25.1% of participants in arm 2 (DIABEO alone) and in 37.6% in arm 3 (DIABEO + telemonitoring by trained nurses). The fact that so many of the participants failed to use the app to improve their metabolic control (mean HbA1c of 9.1%) calls for the need to develop better strategies to increase the use of the app and the participants' engagement. Decision support systems should be developed in a way that will minimize the burden of the person with diabetes. The insulin data and glucose information as well as carbohydrate consumption and sport activities should be transmitted by sophisticated sensors passively to be analyzed by the app with no diaries for the patient to document the needed data. The dashboards that both patients and healthcare providers use should be simple and self‐explanatory. I believe that these modern tools will improve patients' engagement even if they are poorly controlled, and these should be indeed tested in real‐life settings.Validation of a Diagnostic Support System for Diabetic Retinopathy Based on Clinical ParametersRomero‐Aroca P1, Verges‐Pujol R1, Santos‐Blanco E1, Maarof N2, Valls A2, Mundet X3, Moreno A2, Galindo L4, Baget‐Bernaldiz M11Ophthalmology Service, Hospital Universitat Sant Joan, Institut de Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili, Universitat Rovira & Virgili, Reus, Spain; 2Department of Computer Engineering and Mathematics, Universitat Rovira & Virgili, Reus, Spain; 3Unitat de suport a la recerca Barcelona ciutat, Insititut Universitari d'Investigacio en Atencio Primaria Jordi Gol, Barcelona, Spain; 4Universidad Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, SpainTrans Vis Sci Tech 2021;10: 17PurposeThe authors aimed to validate a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that estimates risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to personalize screening protocols in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.MethodsThe authors used a CDSS based on a fuzzy random forest, integrated by fuzzy decision trees with the following variables: current age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes duration and treatment, HbA1c, glomerular filtration rate, microalbuminuria, and body mass index. Validation was made using the electronic health records of a sample of 101,802 T2DM patients. Diagnosis was made by retinal photographs, according to EURODIAB guidelines and the International Diabetic Retinopathy Classification.ResultsDR was prevalent in 19,759 patients (19.98%). Of the participants who were evaluated, the authors found 16,593 (16.31%) true positives, 72,617 (71.33%) true negatives, 3,165 (3.1%) false positives, and 9,427 (9.26%) false negatives, with an accuracy of 0.876 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.858–0.886), sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 83.46–84.49), specificity of 88.5% (95% CI, 88.29–88.72), positive predictive value of 63.8% (95% CI, 63.18–64.35), negative predictive value of 95.8% (95% CI, 95.68–95.96), positive likelihood ratio of 7.30, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.18. The type 1 error was 0.115, and the type 2 error was 0.16.ConclusionsThe authors confirmed a good prediction rate for DR from a representative sample of T2DM in our population. The CDSS was also able to offer an individualized screening protocol for each patient according to the calculated risk confidence value.Translational relevanceResults from this study will be helpful in establishing a novel strategy for personalizing screening for DR according to patient risk factors.CommentIn the present manuscript, the authors describe a CDSS that estimates the risk of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

There are currently multiple technologies for DR detection, some of which are already commercially available. To understand how these technologies work, we must know first some basic concepts about artificial intelligence (AI) such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML is the basic process by which AI incorporates new data using different algorithms and thus creates new knowledge on its base, learns from it, and makes determinations and predictions on some subject based on all that information. AI can be presented at various levels. DL is a specific type of ML, which trains a computer to perform tasks as humans do, such as speech recognition, image identification, or making predictions. DL has shown promising diagnostic performance in image recognition, being widely adopted in many domains, including medicine.

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.","This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field."

Poorly managed diabetes can lead to serious and life-threatening health complications. A person’s glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C or A1C) measures the average blood glucose for the past 2–3 months by measuring how much glucose is bound to the hemoglobin cells in the blood. The HbA1C is used both to diagnose diabetes and assess the effectiveness of a person’s management plan. Developing a model that can accurately predict a person’s future HbA1C 2–3 months in advance holds immense potential for preventative and tailored medical care. With the new era of artificial intelligence (AI) it becomes increasing evident that some of unanswered health issues can be unlocked by leveraging on advanced AI and machine learning algorithms. In addition, sudden plummeted or elevated blood glucose levels also pose serious and life-threating consequences to diabetic people.

Ejay Nsugbe","","","Diabetes is a chronic non-communicable disease resulting from pancreatic inability to produce the hormone insulin, or a physiological cellular inability to use this hormone effectively. Insulin is responsible for maintaining biological homeostasis by enabling glucose to enter cells as their primary energy source. In the UK, 4.1 million people live with diabetes, while a further 850,000 are currently undiagnosed. Current global estimates identify 1 in 11 people as having diabetes. Unregulated glucose levels cause significant, and often irreversible, damage to blood vessels in the eyes, kidneys, teeth, and skin. Current means of glucose level monitoring range from infrequent capillary blood glucose sampling to continuous interstitial fluid glucose monitoring. While these methods can minimise their accuracy is limited by the cleanliness of skin, adequate hydration, certain medications and appropriate calibration methods.
A potential solution to this shortcoming involves the use of wearable sensors which record various information from an individual’s daily activities which have been shown in the medical literature to influence glucose levels and therein serve as potential predictors for estimating overall glucose level. Five features from the wearable device were applied in this work and include daily metrics such as; calories burned, number of steps taken, distance covered, minutes sedentary and activity calories. These features were in turn fused and post-processed with machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of an individual’s glucose level and showed potential for being able to provide an Artificial Intelligence driven glucose monitoring platform.
In this paper we conduct a comparison case study involving the use of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for the classification of glucose level with data acquired from the wearable sensors of a Type 1 diabetic individual. Preliminary results demonstrate predicted glucose levels with >70% accuracy, providing that the potential for this approach to be used in in the design of an ergonomic glucose prediction platform utilising wearable sensors.
Further work will involve the exploration of additional datasets from affordable wearables to enhance and improve the prediction power of the machine learning algorithms.","In this paper, a comparison case study involving the use of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for the classification of glucose level with data acquired from the wearable sensors of a Type 1 diabetic individual was conducted."

The total number of patients with diabetes is estimated to reach 300 million by 2025 and 366 million by 2030 [1, 2]. India, China and the United States will remain the top three nations with the highest numbers of people with diabetes worldwide. A proportion of the affected population is also at risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Recent studies revealed that up to over 18% of patients in China [3] and over 21% in India [4] are affected by DR. Effective screening and early intervention are essential for the cost-effective prevention of irreversible blindness from DR [5]. Early diagnosis of DR requires systematic and extensive screening due to the asymptomatic nature of this major cause of preventable blindness. The deficiency in qualified professionals for providing effective screening and treatment of vision threatening DR poses further challenges in both India [6] and China [7]. In the United States, where specialised healthcare has been relatively more accessible, eye care was reported to be available to only <60% of these patients [8]. Promising results from a few research groups worldwide have shown the potential role of deep learning algorithm within quality assured artificial intelligence (AI) assisted systems for DR screening. In a prospective study published earlier this year, Gulshan and colleagues demonstrated the equivalent or better performance of a deep learning algorithm in the diagnosis of moderate or worse DR compared with experienced specialists or trained graders in a cohort of 3049 patients from two hospitals in India [8]. Deep learning algorithm using a convolutional neural network achieved high accuracy in identifying vision threatening DR from over 35,000 images from population-based cohorts of Malays, Caucasian Australians and Indigenous Australians [9]. In another large-scale multiethnic cohort, deep learning showed performance in the diagnosis of DR of various severity comparable with retina specialists or professional ocular image graders [10]. In 2018, IDx-DR developed by researchers from the University of Iowa, became the first FDA-approved AI-based automated DR screening system and achieved satisfactory results in screening referable DR in primary care [11]. In China, AI assisted system completed DR screening of over 28,000 [12] diabetic patients within 1 year from the National Metabolic Management Center that covers 542 hospitals in over 30 provincial administrative regions of China [13]. An ideal AI programme in DR screening should be able to demonstrate both high sensitivity and high specificity to assure an optimal balance between safety and efficiency. Tremendous amount of effort has been devoted to targeting and tackling the barriers to improving the performance of deep learning algorithms, such as the development of methodologies for image standardisation and preprocessing [14], selection of reference standards [6, 15], employment of convolutional neural networks [14], and adoption of suitable database for training and validation. The recently published work by Gulshan and colleagues using the improved Inception-v4 neural network architecture shows encouraging improvement by demonstrating equivalent or better performance in assessing moderate or severe DR * Mingwei Zhao dr_zhaomingwei@163.com","The recently published work by Gulshan and colleagues using the improved Inception-v4 neural network architecture shows encouraging improvement by demonstrating equivalent or better performance in assessing moderate or severe DR."

After building the models, the computed results of these algorithms were compared by confusion matrixes, receiver operating characteristic curves, and Precision-Recall curves. The performance of the Support Vector Machine algorithm was the best since it had the highest true-positive rate, area under the curve for ROC curve, and area under the curve for Precision-Recall curve.

DM is one of the major causes of blindness in young adults around the world. The most serious ocular complication of DM is diabetic retinopathy (DR).Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication in diabetes1, for the screening of which the retinal imaging is the most widely used method due to its high sensitivity in detecting retinopathy. Prompt diagnosis is important through efficient screening. The evaluation of the severity and degree of retinopathy associated with a person having diabetes is currently performed by medical experts based on the fundus or retinal images of the patient’s eyes As the number of patients with diabetes is rapidly increasing, the number of retinal images produced by the screening programmes will also increase, which in turn introduces a large labor-intensive burden on the medical experts as well as cost to the healthcare services. Manual grading of these images to determine the severity of DR is rather slow and resource demanding. This could be alleviated with an automated system either as support for medical experts’ work or as full diagnosis tool. This labor-intensive task could greatly benefit from automatic detection using machine learning technique. Early detection and timely treatment have been shown to prevent visual loss and blindness in patients with retinal complications of diabetes. Machine learning in recent years has been the evolving, reliable and supporting tools in medical domain and has provided the greatest support for predicting disease with correct case of training and testing. The objective of this paper is to explore the work happening on the detection, progression and feature selection process for the prediction of DR and to establish the extent and depth of existing knowledge on RD prediction process.","The objective of this paper is to explore the work happening on the detection, progression and feature selection process for the prediction of DR and to establish the extent and depth of existing knowledge on RD prediction process."

AI is revolutionizing chronic disease management, particularly for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Through the incorporation of evidence from AI-enabled models, the research projects predictive accuracies exceeding 80% in the onset and progression of illness and their role in ensuring early diagnosis, customized treatment, and operational efficiency. Inventions like neural networks improved by particle swarm optimization attain diagnostic accuracies of 99.67%, while edge computing helps real-time monitoring to reduce hospitalizations through early interventions. Although AI in health care has advanced significantly, algorithmic biases against underrepresented populations—e.g., older adults and non-White communities—fragmented data ecosystems preventing institutional interoperability, and ethical issues regarding privacy and transparency continue to impede scalability and fair implementation. To overcome these obstacles and ensure innovations are distributed equitably across global health care systems, future initiatives should prioritize multimodal data fusion, fairness audits during model development, federated learning frameworks that support safe cross-institutional collaboration, and large clinical trials that validate AI in multiple real-world settings. The advancement of AI has an opportunity to significantly enhance the quality of life for those struggling with chronic diseases and transform health care systems globally, provided that its advancement strategies are transparent, equitable, and focused on wide-ranging validation projects. By combining different multimodal data (EHRs, wearables, and genomes) with fairness audits and federated learning, this review provides a novel synthesis of AI advances for the prediction of chronic diseases. This assessment stands out from others because it addresses both technical performance and ethical deployment strategies. The aim is to support efforts to generate AI adoption equitably in the real world.
