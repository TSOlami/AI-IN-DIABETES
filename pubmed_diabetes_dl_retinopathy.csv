EDCs operate through various mechanisms, including receptor binding, interference with hormone production pathways, modification of hormone-transporting proteins, or disturbance of hormonal metabolic processes. Evidence links EDCs to several health conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Fortunately, the field of biomarker discovery for metabolic and endocrine disorders is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by advancements in metabolomics, multi-omics integration, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced diagnostics. Cutting-edge analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and next-generation sequencing, have facilitated the identification of novel biomarkers for early disease detection, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Metabolomics has played a crucial role in unraveling disease mechanisms, identifying biochemical signatures of metabolic dysfunctions, and bridging traditional and modern medical approaches. However, challenges remain in clinical validation, reproducibility, and specificity of these biomarkers. The incorporation of multi-omics technologies such as genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomic has provided a more comprehensive view of metabolic dysregulation. Future advancements in machine learning, AI-driven data analytics, and single-cell omics are expected to revolutionize precision medicine by enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes. As biomarker research continues to evolve, the convergence of high-throughput technologies, computational approaches, and clinical validation efforts will be critical in ensuring their translation into routine medical practice."

Early detection and prevention of DR is crucial to reduce the burden of this disease. The purpose of this study was to build a prediction model for DR using pupillary abnormalities as biomarkers. Pupillary parameters including Dark-adapted Baseline Pupillary Diameter (BPD), Amplitude of Pupillary Constriction (APC), Velocity of Pupillary Constriction (VPC), Amplitude of Pupil Re-dilatation after Maximum Constriction, and Velocity of Pupillary Dilatation (VPD) were collected and analyzed using machine learning algorithm including Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regressions, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier. Utilizing ROC analysis and the Youden index, this study identified cut-off values for pupillary abnormalities to detect DR risk. The study found that ANN performed well with an accuracy of 0.807 (95% CI: 0.65-0.94) and AUC of 0.879 (95% CI: 0.71-0.98) in predicting DR using pupillary abnormalities as biomarkers. The findings of this research offer significant insights into the predictive value of pupillary abnormalities for DR, establishing a strong foundation for early intervention strategies. Particularly, the superior performance of ANN in detecting DR presents an opportunity to refine risk stratification and prevention approaches, potentially transforming the prognosis for individuals at elevated risk of this condition."

This study evaluates the U-Net3 + model for pixel-level hemorrhage segmentation in fundus images and examines its performance across clinically meaningful retinal regions. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Dice score and further analyzed across perivascular and extravascular areas, perifoveal and extrafoveal regions, fovea-centered quadrants, and images stratified by hemorrhage burden. U-Net3 + achieved strong overall performance, with 99.93% accuracy, 87.03% sensitivity, 99.97% specificity, and an 85.02% Dice score. Higher segmentation accuracy was observed in extravascular regions and within the foveal area, while quadrant-wise performance remained largely consistent. Images with greater hemorrhage burden demonstrated higher segmentation reliability. These findings highlight the importance of region-aware evaluation and suggest that U-Net3 + can provide clinically meaningful support for automated DR screening. Further validation using larger and multi-center datasets is required to enhance the model's generalizability for real-world clinical deployment."

Almenweer","10.1038/s41598-026-35540-3","","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a critical source of blindness that can be prevented globally, and accurate analysis of retinal fundus images enables early detection. Fundus images are often affected by multiple noise sources, which impair image quality and hinder the observation of delicate retinal structures, including microaneurysms and small blood vessels. Deep learning driven denoising models are computationally intensive and prone to overfitting on small medical datasets. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the present paper suggests a Quantum Denoising Autoencoder (QDAE), a hybrid quantum-classical architecture, which uses convolutional feature coding with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in latent space. The suggested QDAE applies quantum superposition and entanglement to improve the latent representations, thereby improving denoising and retinal detail preservation. Experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy 224 × 224 (2019) dataset show that QDAE performs considerably better than classical denoising architectures, including CAE, ResNet, and DnCNN with PSNR of 38.8 dB, SSIM of 0.96, and AMI of 0.88. The approach preserves delicate retinal patterns and intensity consistency, while incurring a slight computational overhead associated with shallow quantum circuits. The results presented above demonstrate that QDAE is a potential quantum-aided architecture for denoising retinal images and a feasible preprocessing procedure in early diabetic retinopathy."

Existing methods rely heavily on manual annotation or training-intensive deep learning models that lack generalizability. Here we report RADAR. This is an annotation-free computational framework for the 3D segmentation and quantification of optical coherence tomography angiography data. The pipeline integrates adaptive physics-aware denoising with topology-preserving centerline extraction to reconstruct complex networks without manual labeling. We validated the framework in healthy individuals and patients with early-stage diabetic retinopathy. The method outperformed standard segmentation tools and resolved layer-specific morphological alterations obscured in conventional two-dimensional projections. Quantitative analysis revealed distinct patterns of compensatory remodeling and increased tortuosity in diabetic eyes. RADAR enables precise extraction of volumetric biomarkers including vessel length and branching complexity. It provides a scalable tool for early detection and longitudinal assessment of ocular and systemic vascular diseases."

In this study, we analyze fecal and serum metabolomes in first-episode depression and matched controls (n = 186), with validation in three independent cohorts (n = 223, 85, 52) including drug intervention. Significant disruptions are noted in 53 gut microbial species, 12 microbiota-related metabolic pathways, and 34 metabolites in depressive individuals compared to controls. Sixteen metabolites exhibit reversal after drug administration. Partial Spearman analysis identifies 271 species-metabolite correlations, and mediation analysis unveils 61 metabolite-mediated species-depression correlations. Key features associated with depression, including Bifidobacterium longum, Parasutterella excrementihominis, tyrosine, serotonin, and homovanillic acid, are highlighted. A machine learning model with 34 metabolites achieves area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values of 0.82 and 0.80 in discriminating depression from control in test and validation sets. Our findings highlight metabolites as key mediators linking microbiota to depression and as valuable indicators for its identification."

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for precision intervention. This study aimed to develop and validate an online interpretable machine learning system for forecasting the CMM risk in T2DM populations to facilitate personalized decision-making and early intervention. We used data from 793 T2DM patients from a tertiary hospital in Shanxi Province as the derivation cohort, divided into training (80%) and internal validation (20%) sets, with 360 cases from another independent center for external validation. Feature selection was performed through recursive feature elimination with random forest algorithm. We employed six machine learning algorithms to develop the CMM risk model. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) provided model interpretability. After feature screening, nine predictors were included in the model. In internal validation, the Stacking model achieved the highest AUC (0.868), maintaining good external validation performance with an AUC of 0.822. The web-based system was accessible on https://t2dmcmmpredictionweb.streamlit.app/.

Lu","10.1016/j.saa.2026.127472","","Early and precise diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is crucial for improving maternal and neonatal outcomes and reducing the risk of adverse pregnancy events. However, current clinical screening methods for GDM still exhibit limitations in detection speed, sensitivity and convenience, making it difficult to meet the clinical demand for rapid early-pregnancy screening. To address this, we propose a novel strategy for early GDM diagnosis based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with deep learning, aiming to achieve rapid and accurate early screening. Characteristic SERS spectra of serum were obtained using a substrate based on silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). A fused PCA-CNN model integrating principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for feature learning was developed. The PCA-CNN model effectively extracts potential biomarker features from serum SERS spectra, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 93.7%, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the entire detection process can be completed within 30 min, requires about 2.5 μL of serum per sample, and involves minimal preprocessing, highlighting both efficiency and practicality. This study provides a novel method for early GDM screening that combines high diagnostic performance with clinical applicability, offering promising technical support for early intervention and clinical management of GDM."
