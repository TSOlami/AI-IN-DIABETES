Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population. ","This study proposes a multimodal deep learning architecture that integrates continuous glucose monitoring data with physiological context from health records to predict interstitial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients with high accuracy (up to 96.7%) and low error (MAPE 6-26 mg/dL)."

Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Conclusion GlucoNet‐MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy‐aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a nonparametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. We illustrate the broad utility of our approach in a 26-week clinical trial that treats all continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time series as the primary outcome.

Access to these continuous patterns about individuals' statuses offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying complex diseases and health conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a widely common chronic disease that its roots and progression patterns are not fully understood. Predicting the progression of T2D can inform timely and more effective interventions to prevent or manage the disease. In this study, we have used a dataset related to 63 patients with T2D that includes the data from two different types of wearable devices worn by the patients: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and activity trackers (ActiGraphs). Using this dataset, we created a model for predicting the levels of four major biomarkers related to T2D after a one-year period. We developed a wide and deep neural network and used the data from the demographic information, lab tests, and wearable sensors to create the model. The deep part of our method was developed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to process the time-series dataset collected by the wearables.

This is particularly crucial for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who require long-term self-management. However, with extensive glycemic variability, developing a prediction algorithm applicable across diverse populations remains a significant challenge. Leveraging meta-learning for domain generalization, we propose GPFormer, a Transformer-based zero-shot learning method designed for multi-horizon glucose prediction. We developed GPFormer on the REPLACE-BG dataset, comprising 226 participants with T1D, and proceeded to evaluate its performance using three external clinical datasets with CGM data. These included the OhioT1DM dataset, a publicly available dataset including 12 T1D participants, as well as two proprietary datasets. The first proprietary dataset included 22 participants, while the second contained 45 participants, encompassing a diverse group with T1D, type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes, including patients admitted to hospitals. These four datasets include both outpatient and inpatient settings, various intervention strategies, and demographic variability, which effectively reflect real-world scenarios of CGM usage. When compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods, GPFormer consistently demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest root mean square error for all the evaluated datasets up to a prediction horizon of two hours. These experimental results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed model across a variety of populations, demonstrating its substantial potential to enhance glucose management in a wide range of practical clinical settings.

This study compares machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, their hybrids, and ensemble strategies for predicting the health outcomes of diabetic patients. This work aims to find the best solutions that strike a balance between computational efficiency and accurate prediction. The study systematically assessed a range of predictive models, including sophisticated DL techniques and conventional ML algorithms, based on computational efficiency and performance indicators. The study assessed prediction accuracy, processing speed, scalability, resource consumption, and interpretability using publicly accessible diabetes datasets. It methodically evaluates the selected models using key performance indicators (KPIs), training times, and memory usage. AdaBoost had the highest F1-score (0.74) on PIMA-768, while RF excelled on PIMA-2000 (~0.73). An RNN led the 3-class BRFSS survey (0.44), and a feed-forward DNN excelled on the binary BRFSS subset (0.45), while RF also achieved perfect accuracy on the EMR dataset (1.00) confirming that model performance is tightly coupled to each dataset’s scale, feature mix and label structure. The results highlight how lightweight, interpretable ML and DL models work in resource-constrained environments and for real-time health analytics. The study also compares its results with existing prediction models, confirming the benefits of selected ML approaches in enhancing diabetes-related medical outcomes that are substantial for practical implementation, providing a reliable and efficient framework for automated diabetes prediction to support initiative-taking disease management techniques and tailored treatment. The study concludes the essentiality of conducting a thorough assessment and validation of the model using current institutional datasets as this enhances accuracy, security, and confidence in AI-assisted healthcare decision-making.

Currently, machine learning (ML) models are being constructed on local healthcare systems and are validated internally with no expectation that they would validate externally and thus, are rarely transferrable to a different healthcare system. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: .73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare system (concordance: .62-.90). We believe that our modeling approach, in which a model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit from precision medicine.","It is demonstrated that even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, while a model constructed on a local healthcare system’s cohort is difficult to transfer."

In diabetes management, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are used for three primary application which are closed-loop control algorithms, glucose prediction through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) biosensors and AI algorithms, and the calibration of CGM biosensors with the assistance of AI algorithms. Integration of AI technologies into diabetes care supports better clinical outcomes, thereby reducing administrative burden and costs associated with diabetes management.

Scholars share a common argument that many Artificial Intelligence techniques that successfully model disease are often in the form of a “black box” where the internal workings and complexities are extremely difficult to understand, both from practitioners’ and patients’ perspective. There is a need for appropriate Artificial Intelligence techniques to build predictive models that not only capture unmeasured effects to improve prediction, but are also transparent in how they model data so that knowledge about disease processes can be extracted and trust in the model can be maintained by clinicians. The proposed strategy builds probabilistic graphical models for prediction with the inclusion of informative hidden variables. These are added in a stepwise manner to improve predictive performance whilst maintaining as simple a model as possible, which is regarded as crucial for the interpretation of the prediction results. This chapter explores this key issue with a specific focus on diabetes data. According to the literature on disease modelling, especially on major diseases such as diabetes, a patient’s mortality often occurs due to the associated complications caused by the disease over time and not the disease itself. This is often patient-specific and will depend on what type of cohort a patient belongs to. Another main focus of this study is patient personalisation via precision medicine by discovering meaningful subgroups of patients which are characterised as phenotypes. These phenotypes are explained further using Bayesian network analysis methods and temporal association rules. Overall, this chapter discussed the earlier research of the chapter’s author. It explores Artificial Intelligence (IDA) techniques for modelling the progression of disease whilst simultaneously stratifying patients and doing so in a transparent manner as possible.

However, a critical gap exists around understanding the reproducibility of state-of-the-art methods for blood glucose prediction. In this study, we curated 60 deep learning (DL)-based glucose prediction papers published between 2018–2025 and assessed them against seven established reproducibility criteria. We found that code availability, overreliance on a single public dataset, and limited use of multiple datasets for algorithm development and evaluation are amongst the top challenges to reproducibility. Next, we replicated six representative models from well-cited prior literature using 4602 days of data with over 1.25 million glucose samples from 128 persons with type 1 diabetes across three public datasets - OhioT1DM, DiaTrend, and T1DEXI. Our results show good reproducibility of DL methods when using the same code (where available) and same evaluation dataset. However, we found poor conceptual reproducibility across datasets with significantly different diabetes management. Further analyses revealed that the accuracy of blood glucose prediction methods was significantly associated with individual diabetes management and sex/gender. All models had significantly higher prediction errors for individuals with worse glycemic control and for female subgroups compared to males.

This study utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 101 White and 104 Black participants with type 1 diabetes collected by the JAEB Center for Health Research, US. Long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models were trained on 11 datasets of different proportions of White and Black participants and tailored to each individual using transfer learning to predict glucose 60 minutes ahead based on 60-minute windows. Root mean squared errors (RMSE) were calculated for each participant. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the association between racial composition and RMSE while accounting for age, sex, and training data size. A median of 9 weeks (IQR: 7, 10) of CGM data was available per participant. The divergence in performance (RMSE slope by proportion) was not statistically significant for either group. However, the slope difference (from 0% White and 100% Black to 100% White and 0% Black) between groups was statistically significant (p = 0.02), meaning the RMSE increased 0.04 [0.01, 0.08] mmol/L more for Black participants compared to White participants when the proportion of White participants increased from 0 to 100% in the training data. This difference was attenuated in the transfer learned models (RMSE: 0.02 [-0.01, 0.05] mmol/L, p = 0.20). The racial composition of training data created a small statistically significant difference in the performance of the models, which was not present after using transfer learning.

Several techniques and devices, such as flash glucose meters, have been developed to help T1D patients improve their quality of life. Most recently, the data collected via these devices is being used to train advanced artificial intelligence models to characterize the evolution of the disease and support its management. Data scarcity is the main challenge for generating these models, as most works use private or artificially generated datasets. For this reason, this work presents T1DiabetesGranada, an open under specific permission longitudinal dataset that not only provides continuous glucose levels, but also patient demographic and clinical information. The dataset includes 257 780 days of measurements spanning four years from 736 T1D patients from the province of Granada, Spain. This dataset advances beyond the state of the art as one the longest and largest open datasets of continuous glucose measurements, thus boosting the development of new artificial intelligence models for glucose level characterization and prediction.

Among the different types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, caused by a lack of insulin secretion, is particularly challenging to treat. In this regard, automatic glucose level estimation implements Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices, showing positive therapeutic outcomes. AI-based glucose prediction has commonly followed a deterministic approach, usually with a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these AI-based methods do not provide enough information in critical decision-making scenarios, like in the medical field. This work intends to provide accurate, interpretable, and personalized glucose prediction using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and also includes an uncertainty estimation. The TFT was trained using two databases, an in-house-collected dataset and the OhioT1DM dataset, commonly used for glucose forecasting benchmarking. For both datasets, the set of input features to train the model was varied to assess their impact on model interpretability and prediction performance. Models were evaluated using common prediction metrics, diabetes-specific metrics, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability of the model, including feature importance and attention.

Due to the large amount of data collected by patients with T1D and their variety, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being adopted in these decision support systems.

Potential healthcare disparities can happen when machine learning models, used in diabetes technologies, are trained on data from primarily White patients. We aimed to evaluate algorithmic fairness in glucose predictions. This study utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 101 White and 104 Black participants with type 1 diabetes collected by the JAEB Center for Health Research, US. Long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models were trained on 11 datasets of different proportions of White and Black participants and tailored to each individual using transfer learning to predict glucose 60 minutes ahead based on 60-minute windows. Root mean squared errors (RMSE) were calculated for each participant. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the association between racial composition and RMSE while accounting for age, sex, and training data size. A median of 9 weeks (IQR: 7, 10) of CGM data was available per participant. The divergence in performance (RMSE slope by proportion) was not statistically significant for either group. However, the slope difference (from 0% White and 100% Black to 100% White and 0% Black) between groups was statistically significant (p=0.02), meaning the RMSE increased 0.04 [0.01, 0.08] mmol/L more for Black participants compared to White participants when the proportion of White participants increased from 0 to 100% in the training data. This difference was attenuated in the transfer learned models (RMSE: 0.02 [-0.01, 0.05] mmol/L, p=0.20). The racial composition of training data created a small statistically significant difference in the performance of the models, which was not present after using transfer learning. This demonstrates the importance of diversity in datasets and the potential value of transfer learning for developing more fair prediction models.

Type 1 DM (DM1) constitutes the insulin-dependent manifestation from disease onset. Effective DM1 management necessitates daily blood glucose monitoring, pattern recognition, and cognitive prediction of future glycemic levels to ascertain the requisite exogenous insulin dosage. Nevertheless, this methodology may prove imprecise and perilous. The advent of groundbreaking developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), encompassing Big Data, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning algorithms (ML), has facilitated continuous DM1 management monitoring. This investigation concentrates on IoMT-based methodologies for the unbroken observation of DM1 management, thereby enabling comprehensive characterization of diabetic individuals. Integrating machine learning techniques with wearable technology may yield dependable models for forecasting short-term blood glucose concentrations. The objective of this research is to devise precise person-specific short-term prediction models, utilizing an array of features. To accomplish this, inventive modeling strategies were employed on an extensive dataset comprising glycaemia-related biological attributes gathered from a large-scale passive monitoring initiative involving 40 DM1 patients. The models produced via the Random Forest approach can predict glucose levels within a 30-minute horizon with an average error of 18.60 mg/dL for six-hour data, and 26.21 mg/dL for a 45-minute prediction horizon.

Diabetic microvascular complications significantly impact morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) in predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN).


METHODS
A comprehensive PubMed search from 1990 to 2023 identified studies on ML/AI models for diabetic microvascular complications. The review analyzed study design, cohorts, predictors, ML techniques, prediction horizon, and performance metrics.


RESULTS
Among the 74 identified studies, 256 featured internally validated ML models and 124 had externally validated models, with about half being retrospective. Since 2010, there has been a rise in the use of ML for predicting microvascular complications, mainly driven by DKD research across 27 countries. A more modest increase in ML research on DR and DN was observed, with publications from fewer countries. For all microvascular complications, predictive models achieved a mean (standard deviation) c-statistic of 0.79 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.72 (0.12) on external validation. Diabetic kidney disease models had the highest discrimination, with c-statistics of 0.81 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.74 (0.13) on external validation, respectively. Few studies externally validated prediction of DN. The prediction horizon, outcome definitions, number and type of predictors, and ML technique significantly influenced model performance.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE

Selecting the right ML algorithm is critical given the array of available choices. Integrating data from IoT devices presents promising opportunities to enhance real-time blood glucose management models. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models utilizing IoT device data for predicting blood glucose levels. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases for studies published between 2019 and 2023. We excluded studies lacking ML model derivation or performance metrics. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool assessed study quality. Our primary outcomes compared ML models for BG level prediction across different prediction horizons (PHs). RESULTS: We analyzed ten eligible studies across prediction horizons of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. ML models exhibited mean absolute RMSE values of 15.02 (SD 1.45), 21.488 (SD 2.92), 30.094 (SD 3.245), and 35.89 (SD 6.4) mg/dL, respectively. Random Forest demonstrated superior performance across these PHs. CONCLUSION: We observed significant heterogeneity across all subgroups, indicating diverse sources of variability. As the PH lengthened, the RMSE for blood glucose prediction by the ML model increased, with Random Forest showing the highest relative performance among the ML models. ","This meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models using IoT device data for predicting blood glucose levels, finding Random Forest to be the most accurate model, with increasing mean absolute RMSE values as prediction horizon lengthens."

However, developing a model generalized to a population and subsequently embedding it within a microchip of a wearable device presents significant technical challenges. Furthermore, the domain of BG prediction in T2D remains under-explored in the literature. In light of this, we propose a population-specific BG prediction model, leveraging the capabilities of the temporal fusion Transformer (TFT) to adjust predictions based on personal demographic data. Then the trained model is embedded within a system-on-chip, integral to our low-power and low-cost customized wearable device. This device seamlessly communicates with CGM systems through Bluetooth and provides timely BG predictions using edge computing. When evaluated on two publicly available clinical datasets with a total of 124 participants with T1D or T2D, the embedded TFT model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest prediction errors when compared with a range of machine learning baseline methods. Executing the TFT model on our wearable device requires minimal memory and power consumption, enabling continuous decision support for more than 51 days on a single Li-Poly battery charge. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of the proposed TFT model and wearable device in enhancing the quality of life for people with diabetes and effectively addressing real-world challenges.","A population-specific BG prediction model is proposed, leveraging the capabilities of the temporal fusion Transformer (TFT) to adjust predictions based on personal demographic data and embedded within a system-on-chip of a low-power and low-cost customized wearable device."

Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions. This review highlights current developments and outlines future directions to support the design of scalable, generalizable, and clinically applicable multimodal DL systems for DR detection.
