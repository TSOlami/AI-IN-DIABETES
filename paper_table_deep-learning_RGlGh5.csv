Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Conclusion GlucoNet‐MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy‐aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

This research describes a two-part architecture that combines an energy-efficient wireless communication technology with an interpretable deep learning model for diabetes categorization. In Phase 1, a unique wireless communication model is created to assure the accurate transfer of real-time patient data from wearable devices to medical centers. Using Lagrange optimization, the model identifies the best transmission distance and power needs, lowering energy usage while preserving communication dependability. This contribution is especially essential since effective data transport is a necessary condition for continuous monitoring in large-scale healthcare systems.

These four datasets include both outpatient and inpatient settings, various intervention strategies, and demographic variability, which effectively reflect real-world scenarios of CGM usage. When compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods, GPFormer consistently demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest root mean square error for all the evaluated datasets up to a prediction horizon of two hours.

The state of the art of BG prediction has been achieved by leveraging advanced deep learning methods to model multi-modal data, i.e., sensor data and self-reported event data, organised as multi-variate time series (MTS). However, these methods are mostly regarded as ``black boxes'' and not entirely trusted by clinicians and patients. In this paper, we propose interpretable graph attentive recurrent neural networks (GARNNs) to model MTS, explaining variable contributions via summarizing variable importance and generating feature maps by graph attention mechanisms instead of post-hoc analysis. We evaluate GARNNs on four datasets, representing diverse clinical scenarios. Upon comparison with twelve well-established baseline methods, GARNNs not only achieve the best prediction accuracy but also provide high-quality temporal interpretability, in particular for postprandial glucose levels as a result of corresponding meal intake and insulin injection. These findings underline the potential of GARNN as a robust tool for improving diabetes care, bridging the gap between deep learning technology and real-world healthcare solutions.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) facilitates blood glucose level prediction (BGLP), allowing for timely interventions based on insulin delivery and carbohydrate intake to prevent complications. Current research has developed sequential models to predict BGLP, incorporating historical BG data along with factors like meal and insulin intake. These models show high performance and some temporal explainability but lack clarity in showing the importance of each attribute and risk privacy by merging data from multiple participants. To address these issues, a novel approach utilizing a graph attention memory (GAM) model comprising a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and a graph attention network (GAT) is proposed. Various data can be organized as multivariate time series, and GAT models the patterns among multiple variables. This method enhances attribute correlation modeling and provides transparent attribute relationships through dynamic graph structures, with attention weights indicating attribute importance over time. Then, GRU aggregates graph features, generating compact vectors for future BG prediction. Additionally, we employ federated learning (FL) for privacy-preserving population pattern learning. FL enables data to be leveraged in local devices rather than being sent to other places, protecting patients' privacy. In our experiments, evaluated using data from the OhioT1DM dataset, our proposed methods demonstrated stability and effectiveness.

Design Retrospective analysis of clinical OCT and OCTA scans of control and diabetic patients. Participants The data used for microvasculature segmentation consisted of OCTA en face images acquired from four OCT instruments with a total of 153 images, with fields-of-view ranging from 2×2mm to 6×6mm. The data used for RDR classification consisted of OCTA en face images and structural OCT projections acquired from two commercial OCT systems with a total of 700 images. Methods OCTA images used for microvasculature segmentation were manually delineated and verified by retina experts. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was evaluated by retinal specialists and condensed into two classes: non-referable DR, and RDR. The federated learning configuration was demonstrated via simulation using four clients for microvasculature segmentation and compared with other collaborative methods. Subsequently, federated learning was applied over multiple institutions for RDR classification, and was compared with models trained and tested on data from the same institution (internal models) and different institutions (external models). Main Outcome Measures:For microvasculature segmentation, we measured the accuracy and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). For severity classification, we measured accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, area under the precision-recall curve, balanced accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of further stratified severities. Results For both applications, federated learning achieved similar performance to internal models. Additionally, for microvasculature segmentation, the federated learning model achieved similar performance (mean DSC across all test sets 0.793) to models trained on a fully-centralized dataset (mean DSC: 0.807). For RDR classification, federated learning achieved an AUROC of 0.944–0.970; the internal models attained an AUROC of 0.945-0.978.

Here, to bridge the gaps, we developed an integrated image–language system (DeepDR-LLM), combining a large language model (LLM module) and image-based deep learning (DeepDR-Transformer), to provide individualized diabetes management recommendations to PCPs. In a retrospective evaluation, the LLM module demonstrated comparable performance to PCPs and endocrinology residents when tested in English and outperformed PCPs and had comparable performance to endocrinology residents in Chinese. For identifying referable DR, the average PCP’s accuracy was 81.0% unassisted and 92.3% assisted by DeepDR-Transformer. Furthermore, we performed a single-center real-world prospective study, deploying DeepDR-LLM. We compared diabetes management adherence of patients under the unassisted PCP arm ( n = 397) with those under the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm ( n = 372). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm showed better self-management behaviors throughout follow-up ( P &lt; 0.05). For patients with referral DR, those in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm were more likely to adhere to DR referrals ( P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, DeepDR-LLM deployment improved the quality and empathy level of management recommendations. Given its multifaceted performance, DeepDR-LLM holds promise as a digital solution for enhancing primary diabetes care and DR screening.

Aiming to improve the treatment of people with diabetes, digital health has been widely adopted in recent years and generated a huge amount of data that could be used for further management of this chronic disease. Taking advantage of this, approaches that use artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning, an emerging type of machine learning, have been widely adopted with promising results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified three main areas that use this approach: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications. The search resulted in the selection of 40 original research articles, of which we have summarized the key information about the employed learning models, development process, main outcomes, and baseline methods for performance evaluation. Among the analyzed literature, it is to be noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. Meanwhile, we identify some limitations in the current literature, such as a lack of data availability and model interpretability. The rapid developments in deep learning and the increase in available data offer the possibility to meet these challenges in the near future and allow the widespread deployment of this technology in clinical settings.","A comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes is presented and it is noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches."

The treatment and management of complex chronic diseases, such as diabetes, stands to benefit from novel AI algorithms analyzing the frequent real-time streaming data and the occasional medical diagnostics and laboratory test results reported in electronic health records (EHR). Novel algorithms are needed to develop trustworthy, responsible, reliable, and robust AI techniques that can handle the imperfect and imbalanced data of EHRs and inconsistencies or discrepancies with free-living self-reported information. The challenges and applications of AI for two problems in the healthcare domain were explored in this work. First, we introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes. Then, we studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data.

Empowered by the recent development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and deep learning technologies have been demonstrated to achieve the state of the art in BG prediction. However, it is challenging to implement such algorithms in actual clinical settings to provide persistent decision support due to the high demand for computational resources, while smartphone-based implementations are limited by short battery life and require users to carry the device.

In addition, we developed a smartphone app to visualize BG trajectories and predictions, and desktop and cloud platforms to backup data and fine-tune models. The embedded model was evaluated on three clinical data sets including 47 T1D subjects. The proposed model achieved superior performance of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error, and glucose-specific RMSE, and obtained the best accuracy for hypoglycemia detection when compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods. Moreover, we performed hardware-in-the-loop in silico trials with ten virtual T1D adults to test the whole IoMT system with predictive low-glucose management, which significantly reduced hypoglycemia and improved BG control.

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements.

Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population.

However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability. A robust approach is needed to leverage massive CGM data for near-future glucose prediction. We propose large sensor models (LSMs) to capture knowledge in CGM data by modeling patients as sequences of glucose.

Additionally, we assessed its generalizability across factors like diabetes type, age, gender, and hour of day. CGM-LSM achieved exceptional performance, with an rMSE of 29.81 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients and 23.49 mg/dL for type 2 diabetes patients in a two-hour prediction horizon. For the OhioT1DM dataset, CGM-LSM achieved a one-hour rMSE of 15.64 mg/dL, halving the previous best of 31.97 mg/dL.

Owing to the complexity of the blood glucose dynamics, it is difficult to design accurate predictive models in every circumstance, i.e., hypo/normo/hyperglycemic events. We developed deep-learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patient-specific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5 min to 1 h. In general, the major challenges to address are (1) the dataset of each patient is often too small to train a patient-specific deep-learning model, and (2) the dataset is usually highly imbalanced given that hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes are usually much less common than normoglycemia. We tackle these two challenges using transfer learning and data augmentation, respectively. We systematically examined three neural network architectures, different loss functions, four transfer-learning strategies, and four data augmentation techniques, including mixup and generative models. Taken together, utilizing these methodologies we achieved over 95% prediction accuracy and 90% sensitivity for a time period within the clinically useful 1 h prediction horizon that would allow a patient to react and correct either hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. We have also demonstrated that the same network architecture and transfer-learning methods perform well for the type 1 diabetes OhioT1DM public dataset.","In this article, the authors developed deep learning methods to predict patient-specific blood glucose during various time horizons in the immediate future using patientspecific every 30-min long glucose measurements by the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to predict future glucose levels in 5min to 1h."

Notably, usage has expanded to predict an individual’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes. A scoping review of 40 studies by Mohsen et al. shows that while most studies used unimodal AI models, multimodal approaches were superior because they integrate multiple types of data. However, creating multimodal models and determining model performance are challenging tasks given the multi-factored nature of diabetes. For both unimodal and multimodal models, there are also concerns of bias with the lack of external validations and representation of race, age, and gender in training data. The barriers in data quality and evaluation standardization are ripe areas for developing new technologies, especially for entrepreneurs and innovators.

Accordingly, recent studies have used multiple simple rules to adequately explain the diagnostic process and results to patients. However, this can cause patient confusion as the rules vary. Hence, this study proposes a deep neural network (DNN) with random forest (RF) and modified random forest incremental interpretation (MRFII) approach for diagnosing diabetes. This method first entails constructing a DNN to predict the probability of a patient having diabetes. To make the prediction result explainable, an RF is built to explain the process and results in terms of multiple simple decision rules. Additionally, to eliminate patient confusion, the MRFII is proposed to sort and aggregate the decision rules for a specific patient. A certainty mechanism is also established to feed back the explanation results from RF to improve the effectiveness of the DNN. The proposed method was applied to a diabetes dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the results showed that this approach provided a more concise and accurate explanation than existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for the same purpose.

Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. 1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. 2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. 3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.","In this article , the authors focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision-making: explainable AI, domain adaptation, and federated learning."

However, extracting meaningful patterns from CGM data to enhance glucose level predictions remains a challenge. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning method of Triplet Network to disentangle CGM pattern based on specific trends and employs a deep learning-based regressor to predict glucose levels. Especially, the disentanglement method was used to enhance the classification process of the specific glucose trends visible in CGM data. This allows CGM regressor to differentiate basic glucose data into meaningful representations, as the disentanglement contributes to the network to focus on clustering salient figures. We used the Glucobench dataset, a collection of real-world CGM data from 5 diverse cohorts, including 5 to 208 participants. Despite the inherent variability in glucose recordings, our model demonstrated robust trend capture and prediction accuracy. We explored multiple window sizes and dense layer configurations, incorporating a 1D convolutional layer to enhance performance.

CGM devices are also highly visible and can thus act as a discomforting disease-marker for diabetes patients. To mitigate these issues, we develop and test a novel method that is able to predict blood glucose levels with only non-invasive predictor variables and a very small number of target variable measurements by using individualization and self-supervised deep learning. Using only a single blood glucose measurements per week, our method (6387.47 glucose-specific MSE) outperforms traditional deep learning performed with hourly measurements (8191.23 glucose-specific MSE). Across eight experiments where blood glucose measurements are more than one hour apart, our approach outperforms traditional deep learning without exception. Our findings suggest that self-supervised, individualized deep learning could provide an avenue towards alternatives to CGM devices that would be less costly, non-invasive, and thus more accessible.

Clarke error grid analysis demonstrates clinical feasibility with at least 98.81% and 97.25% of predictions within the clinically safe zone at 30- and 60-minute PHs.

Early identification of patients at risk of these microvascular complications using predictive models through machine learning (ML) can be helpful in T1D management. The objective of current review was to systematically identify and summarize published predictive models that used ML to assess the risk of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy in T1D patients.
 Methods: A targeted review of English literature was undertaken in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com/) from January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. Eligible articles were also identified from cross-references. Following concepts were used in combination to conduct the search queries: diabetes, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, microvascular complication, risk/predictive model, and ML/artificial intelligence/data mining.
 Results: A total of 3,769 hits were found from all sources combined, duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were screened, 61 studies underwent full-text review and a total of six studies met the eligibility criteria. Among them, four studies had developed risk models using data obtained from T1D patients alone, whereas two used data from both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. There was only one study that evaluated all three types of microvascular complications while the other five focused on one individual complication, i.e., either diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. Only two studies evaluated time to developing a complication. The other four studies assessed complications as either binary (yes/no) or categorical (multiple levels). Prediction models were built using cross-sectional data from survey questionnaire (n=1, Iran) and longitudinal data (n=5) which were further classified as sources of electronic medical records (EMR) (n=3, US: 1, Europe: 2), clinical trial (n=1, US) and prospective study (n=1, Europe). Common predictors across studies as well as across types of microvascular complications included age, gender, diabetes duration, BMI, blood pressure, lipid level, and mean or a single HbA1C value. Commonly used ML algorithms included classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF) (CART/RF, n=3), support vector machines (SVMs, n=2), logistic regression (LR, n=2) and neural networks (NNs, n=1). Model performance was evaluated using area under curve (AUC, n=4) and accuracy (n=2). Only half (n=3) of the included studies tested their developed models in an external dataset of patients with T1D. Conclusions: Overall, very few studies reported predictive models for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy using ML specifically for T1D patients.

However, collaboratively training a DR staging model across multiple institutions remains a challenge due to non-iid data, client reliability, and confidence evaluation of the prediction. To address these issues, we propose a novel federated uncertainty-aware aggregation paradigm (FedUAA), which considers the reliability of each client and produces a confidence estimation for the DR staging. In our FedUAA, an aggregated encoder is shared by all clients for learning a global representation of fundus images, while a novel temperature-warmed uncertainty head (TWEU) is utilized for each client for local personalized staging criteria. Our TWEU employs an evidential deep layer to produce the uncertainty score with the DR staging results for client reliability evaluation. Furthermore, we developed a novel uncertainty-aware weighting module (UAW) to dynamically adjust the weights of model aggregation based on the uncertainty score distribution of each client. In our experiments, we collect five publicly available datasets from different institutions to conduct a dataset for federated DR staging to satisfy the real non-iid condition. The experimental results demonstrate that our FedUAA achieves better DR staging performance with higher reliability compared to other federated learning methods. Our proposed FedUAA paradigm effectively addresses the challenges of collaboratively training DR staging models across multiple institutions, and provides a robust and reliable solution for the deployment of DR diagnosis models in real-world clinical scenarios.

Since DR is often asymptomatic in its early stage, timely diagnosis is crucial. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to facilitate early disease detection and treatment, but its implementation in the medical field raises significant privacy concerns. The sensitive nature of healthcare data, which includes personal information and medical history, makes data privacy a critical issue. This paper explores the implementation of AI models to predict DR risks while incorporating common defense algorithms to enhance data privacy. An unstructured dataset, specifically the DDR dataset, was used to train Deep Learning (DL) models. Two families of DL models, ResNets and DenseNets, were trained and evaluated based on the performance metrics. ResNet 50 and DenseNet 169 demonstrated superior performance and were selected for further privacy enhancement using encryption. The results indicated that privacy-preserving methods, particularly encryption, did not significantly impact the model performance.

In this study, we look at this problem from the perspective of the forecasting of future glucose values for diabetic people. In this study, we propose the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function. It penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on dangerous regions. In order to use the loss function in practice, we propose an algorithm that progressively improves the clinical acceptability of the model, so that we can achieve the best tradeoff possible between accuracy and given clinical criteria. We evaluate the approaches using two diabetes datasets, one having type-1 patients and the other type-2 patients. The results show that using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the models. In particular, the improvements are significant in the hypoglycemia region. We also show that this increased clinical acceptability comes at the cost of a decrease in the average accuracy of the model. Finally, we show that this tradeoff between accuracy and clinical acceptability can be successfully addressed with the proposed algorithm. For given clinical criteria, the algorithm can find the optimal solution that maximizes the accuracy while at the same meeting the criteria.","In this article, the authors proposed the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function, which penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction."

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model on biomedical temporal data based on a transformer architecture, and trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 non-diabetic individuals. We tokenized the CGM training data and trained GluFormer using next token prediction in a generative, autoregressive manner. We demonstrate that GluFormer generalizes effectively to 15 different external datasets, including 4936 individuals across 5 different geographical regions, 6 different CGM devices, and several metabolic disorders, including normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic populations, as well as those with gestational diabetes and obesity. GluFormer produces embeddings which outperform traditional CGM analysis tools, and achieves high Pearson correlations in predicting clinical parameters such as HbA1c, liver-related parameters, blood lipids, and sleep-related indices. Notably, GluFormer can also predict onset of future health outcomes even 4 years in advance. We also show that CGM embeddings from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the enhanced model can accurately generate CGM data based only on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods. Overall, we show that GluFormer accurately predicts health outcomes which generalize across different populations metabolic conditions.","Researchers develop GluFormer, a transformer-based foundation model that analyzes continuous glucose monitor data to predict health outcomes, achieving high correlations with clinical parameters and generalizing across diverse populations and metabolic conditions."

However, diabetes diagnosis is still an arduous process, given that this disease develops and gets treated outside the clinic. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs) and machine learning points to a potential way forward to address this challenge. WMSs enable a continuous, yet user-transparent, mechanism to collect and analyze physiological signals. However, disease diagnosis based on WMS data and its effective deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging due to inefficient feature extraction and vast computation cost. To address these problems, we propose a framework called DiabDeep that combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with off-the-shelf WMSs for pervasive diabetes diagnosis. DiabDeep bypasses the feature extraction stage and acts directly on WMS data. It enables both an (i) accurate inference on the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on an edge device, e.g., a smartphone, to obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals. On the resource-rich server, we stack sparsely connected layers to deliver high accuracy. On the resource-scarce edge device, we use a hidden-layer long short-term memory based recurrent layer to substantially cut down on computation and storage costs while incurring only a minor accuracy loss. At the core of our system lies a grow-and-prune training flow: it leverages gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning algorithms to enable DiabNNs to learn both weights and connections, while improving accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiabDeep through a detailed analysis of data collected from 52 participants. For server (edge) side inference, we achieve a 96.3 percent (95.3 percent) accuracy in classifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7 percent (94.6 percent) accuracy in distinguishing among type-1 diabetic, type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals. Against conventional baselines, such as support vector machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and linear ridge classifiers, DiabNNs achieve higher accuracy, while reducing the model size (floating-point operations) by up to 454.5× (8.9×). Therefore, the system can be viewed as pervasive and efficient, yet very accurate.","DiabDeep as mentioned in this paper combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with off-the-shelf wearable medical sensors (WMSs) for pervasive diabetes diagnosis, which enables both accurate inference on the server and efficient inference on an edge device to obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals."

Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions. This review highlights current developments and outlines future directions to support the design of scalable, generalizable, and clinically applicable multimodal DL systems for DR detection.

Screening for this disease based on fundus images has been one of the first successful use cases for modern artificial intelligence in medicine. Current state-of-the-art systems typically use black-box models to make referral decisions, requiring post-hoc methods for AI-human interaction. Methods: In this retrospective reader study, we evaluated an inherently interpretable deep learning model, which explicitly models the local evidence of DR as part of its network architecture, for early DR screening. We trained the network on 34,350 high-quality fundus images from a publicly available dataset and validated its state-of-the-art performance on a large range of ten external datasets. We obtained detailed lesion annotations from ophthalmologists on 65 images to study if the class evidence maps highlight clinically relevant information. Finally, we tested the clinical usefulness of our model in a reader study, where we compared screening for DR without AI support to screening with AI support with and without AI explanations. Results: The inherently interpretable deep learning model obtained an accuracy of .906 [.900-.913] (95%-confidence interval) and an AUC of .904 [.894-.913] on the internal test set and similar performance on external datasets.

However, current state-of-the-art systems typically use black-box models to make referral decisions, requiring post-hoc methods for AI-human interaction and clinical decision support. We developed and evaluated an inherently interpretable deep learning model, which explicitly models the local evidence of DR as part of its network architecture, for clinical decision support in early DR screening. We trained the network on 34,350 high-quality fundus images from a publicly available dataset and validated its performance on a large range of ten external datasets. The inherently interpretable model was compared to post-hoc explainability techniques applied to a standard DNN architecture. For comparison, we obtained detailed lesion annotations from ophthalmologists on 65 images to study if the class evidence maps highlight clinically relevant information. We tested the clinical usefulness of our model in a retrospective reader study, where we compared screening for DR without AI support to screening with AI support with and without AI explanations.

In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has provided a convenient approach for comprehensive blood glucose data collection. Despite the widespread use of CGM in clinical practice, we yet have reliable methods to extract meaningful information from short-term CGM sensor data to conveniently assess HbA1c and GA levels in diabetics. In this work, we propose a multitask model called HbA1c and GA multitask levels assessment model (HGMLA) to simultaneously assess HbA1c and GA levels with short-term CGM sensor data to get comprehensive knowledge of relatively long-term glycemic control. Multiscale convolutional kernels and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are utilized in the model to extract glucose fluctuation features at different time scales. Meanwhile, we transform the 1-D glucose sequence into a 2-D tensor and use 2-D convolution to extract the glucose trend features. In addition, specific CGM manual features are extracted, and multitask learning (MTL) framework is employed to simultaneously assess HbA1c and GA levels. Experiments on a dataset of 1378 subjects demonstrated that the HGMLA is able to achieve better performance on both HbA1c and GA assessment tasks compared with fully connected (FC) neural networks and mainstream machine learning models, such as XGBoost and SVM, with an accuracy (ACC) of 86.59% and 84.42% for two assessment tasks, respectively.

In this study, we propose the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function. It penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on dangerous regions.

The results show that using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the models.

People with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need to self-administer insulin to maintain blood glucose (BG) levels in a normal range, which is usually a very challenging task. Developing a reliable glucose forecasting model would have a profound impact on diabetes management, since it could provide predictive glucose alarms or insulin suspension at low-glucose for hypoglycemia minimisation. Recently, deep learning has shown great potential in healthcare and medical research for diagnosis, forecasting and decision-making. In this work, we introduce a deep learning model based on a dilated recurrent neural network (DRNN) to provide 30-min forecasts of future glucose levels. Using dilation, the DRNN model gains a much larger receptive field in terms of neurons aiming at capturing long-term dependencies. A transfer learning technique is also applied to make use of the data from multiple subjects. The proposed approach outperforms existing glucose forecasting algorithms, including autoregressive models (ARX), support vector regression (SVR) and conventional neural networks for predicting glucose (NNPG) (e.g. RMSE = NNPG, 22.9 mg/dL; SVR, 21.7 mg/dL; ARX, 20.1 mg/dl; DRNN, 18.9 mg/dL on the OhioT1DM dataset). The results suggest that dilated connections can improve glucose forecasting performance efficiently.","This work introduces a deep learning model based on a dilated recurrent neural network (DRNN) to provide 30-min forecasts of future glucose levels and suggests that dilated connections can improve glucose forecasting performance efficiently."

To address this, we propose BiT-MAML, a hybrid model combining a Bidirectional LSTM-Transformer with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. We evaluated our model using a rigorous Leave-One-Patient-Out Cross-Validation (LOPO-CV) on the OhioT1DM dataset, ensuring a fair comparison against re-implemented LSTM and Edge-LSTM baselines. The results show our model achieved a mean RMSE of 24.89 mg/dL for the 30 min prediction horizon, marking a substantial improvement of 19.3% over the standard LSTM and 14.2% over the Edge-LSTM. Notably, our model also achieved the lowest standard deviation (±4.60 mg/dL), indicating more consistent and generalizable performance across the patient cohort. A key finding of our study is the confirmation of significant performance variability across individuals, a known clinical challenge. This was evident as our model's 30 min RMSE ranged from an excellent 19.64 mg/dL to a more challenging 30.57 mg/dL, reflecting the inherent difficulty of personalizing predictions rather than model instability. From a clinical safety perspective, Clarke Error Grid Analysis confirmed the model's robustness, with over 92% of predictions falling within the clinically acceptable Zones A and B. This study concludes that the development of effective personalized BG prediction requires not only advanced model architectures but also robust evaluation methods that transparently report the full spectrum of performance, providing a realistic pathway toward reliable clinical tools.

Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a form of diabetic neuropathy characterized by dysfunction of the autonomic nerve system, leading to potential impairment of several organs like the heart and kidneys. DAN is frequently subject to underdiagnosis, mainly due to factors such as the financial burden and limited accessibility of diagnostic equipment, the challenges associated with conducting cardiovascular assessments, and the sometimes silent nature of the disease during its initial phases. In light of this, the purpose of this research is to leverage information retrieved from electronic health records to employ machine learning to detect DAN, particularly an emphasis on diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) in diabetic patients. The machine learning strategy yields a maximum accuracy of 85.5% through the implementation of the Random Forest (RF) and one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) model.

This exploratory study uses machine learning on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to identify factors influencing DR and predict high-risk individuals for timely intervention. Methods: Between June 2018 and March 2022, adults with T1D with incident DR or no retinopathy (control) were identified. The CGM data were collected retrospectively for up to seven years before the date of defining incident DR or no retinopathy. A mixture of three machine learning algorithms was trained and evaluated in two different scenarios, using different glycemic features extracted from CGM traces (scenario 1), and the two principal components (two PCs; exposure to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia risk) of those features (scenario 2). Classifiers were evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC) to select the best classification model. Results: The CGM data of 30 adults with incident DR (mean±SD age of 21.2±9.4 years, glycated hemoglobin [HbA 1c ] of 8.6%±1.0%, and body mass index [BMI] of 24.5±4.8 kg/m 2 ) and 30 adults without DR (age of 41.8±14.7 years, HbA 1c of 7.0%±0.9%, and BMI of 26.2±3.6 kg/m 2 ) were included in this analysis. In scenario 2, classifiers outperformed scenario 1, resulting in an average AUC-ROC increase to 0.92 for two of three models, indicating that the two PCs captured vital classification data, representing the most discriminative aspects and enhancing model performance.

This paper presents a new DR severity assessment approach based on Federated Learning (FL), a recent improvement in deep learning (DL). FL is a novel research paradigm that allows DL models to be trained in groups without revealing clinical data. In this work, we have designed a central server model that trains and updates the weights based on the fundus data received from the clients. Also, we have used different images from two databases for the clients without revealing the clinical data. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on the individual client's data and the updating of the weights with Federated averaging. The proposed model has achieved an accuracy of 93.8% in grading the DR severity. ","A novel DR-FL approach for diabetic retinopathy grading using fundus images achieves an accuracy of 93.8%."

Traditional diagnostic approaches are subject to human error, highlighting the need for modern computational techniques in clinical decision support systems. Although these systems have successfully integrated deep learning (DL) models, they still encounter several challenges, such as a lack of intricate pattern learning, imbalanced datasets, and poor interpretability of predictions. Methods: To address these issues, the temporal inception perceptron network (TIPNet), a novel DL model, is designed to accurately predict diabetes by capturing complex feature relationships and temporal dynamics. An adaptive synthetic oversampling strategy is utilized to reduce severe class imbalance in an extensive diabetes health indicators dataset consisting of 253,680 instances and 22 features, providing a diverse and representative sample for model evaluation. The model's performance and generalizability are assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation technique. To enhance interpretability, explainable artificial intelligence techniques are integrated, including local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and Shapley additive explanations, providing insights into the model's decision-making process. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that TIPNet achieves improvement scores of 3.53% in accuracy, 3.49% in F1-score, 1.14% in recall, and 5.95% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: These findings indicate that TIPNet is a promising tool for early diabetes prediction, offering accurate and interpretable results. The integration of advanced DL modeling with oversampling strategies and explainable AI techniques positions TIPNet as a valuable resource for clinical decision support, paving the way for its future application in healthcare settings.

This study examined the performance of different AI-based methods for DR classification. Deep learning-based models, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, U-Net, and classical CNN structures, along with traditional machine learning algorithms, SVM, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbor, were evaluated on the APTOS 2019 dataset. To optimize model performance, image data were subjected to various preprocessing steps, such as resizing, contrast correction, and denoising. Augmentation techniques were used to increase data diversity. According to experimental results, the most successful model was DenseNet-121, with an accuracy rate of 87% and an F1 score of 86%. In contrast, while classical machine learning methods produce lower accuracy values than deep learning, they exhibit consistent performance under certain conditions and offer a more computationally cost-effective alternative. The comparisons indicate the applicability of classical methods, especially in scenarios with limited data. This evaluation process creates a basic framework that will enable the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches in later stages and is a preparation for adapting interpretation techniques such as SHAP and LIME to clinical decision support systems.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively.

Utilizing population models to address this challenge is a potential solution, but collecting patient data for training population models in a privacy-conscious manner is challenging, especially given that such data is often stored on personal devices. Considering the privacy protection and addressing the ""cold start"" problem in diabetes care, we propose ""GluADFL"", blood Glucose prediction by Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning.

Furthermore, patients' data might be stored and shared across various communication networks in GluADFL, ranging from highly interconnected (e.g., random, performs the best among others) to more structured topologies (e.g., cluster and ring), suitable for various social networks. The asynchronous training framework supports flexible participation. By adjusting the ratios of inactive participants, we found it remains stable if less than 70% are inactive.

The capability of multitask learning to simultaneously acquire knowledge from numerous related tasks, leveraging shared information and inter-dependencies, leads to considerable performance boosts. Integrated into this process is the feature guideline learning task, which empowers the model to have an attention to abnormal areas. This task is initially trained on a small collection of labeled images to develop a custom pre-trained model, which later forms the basis for subsequent classification tasks. The effectiveness of this proposed approach is validated through tests on various data sets.

Developing robust AI models for DR classification holds substantial potential, but a key challenge is ensuring their generalization in unfamiliar domains with varying data distributions. To address this, our paper investigates cross-domain generalization, also known as domain generalization (DG), within the context of DR classification. DG, a challenging problem in the medical domain, is complicated by the difficulty of gathering labeled data across different domains, such as patient demographics and disease stages. Some recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using CLIP to handle the DG problem in natural images. In this study, we investigate CLIP's transfer learning capabilities and its potential for cross-domain generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We carry out comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy and potential of CLIP in addressing DG for DR classification. Further, we introduce a multi-modal fine-tuning strategy named Context Optimization with Learnable Visual Tokens (CoOpLVT), which enhances context optimization by conditioning on visual features. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method increases the F1-score by 1.8% over the baseline, thus underlining its promise for effective DG in DR classification.

This task is very difficult for ophthalmologists and time-consuming. Therefore, many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were developed to automate this screening process of DR. In this paper, a CAD-DR system is proposed based on preprocessing and a pre-train transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (PCNN) to recognize the five stages of DR through retinal fundus images. To develop this CAD-DR system, a preprocessing step is performed in a perceptual-oriented color space to enhance the DR-related lesions and then a standard pre-train PCNN model is improved to get high classification results. The architecture of the PCNN model is based on three main phases. Firstly, the training process of the proposed PCNN is accomplished by using the expected gradient length (EGL) to decrease the image labeling efforts during the training of the CNN model. Secondly, the most informative patches and images were automatically selected using a few pieces of training labeled samples. Thirdly, the PCNN method generated useful masks for prognostication and identified regions of interest. Fourthly, the DR-related lesions involved in the classification task such as micro-aneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates were detected and then used for recognition of DR. The PCNN model is pre-trained using a high-end graphical processor unit (GPU) on the publicly available Kaggle benchmark. The obtained results demonstrate that the CAD-DR system outperforms compared to other state-of-the-art in terms of sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and accuracy (ACC). On the test set of 30,000 images, the CAD-DR system achieved an average SE of 93.20%, SP of 96.10%, and ACC of 98%.

In this study, we explore the inherent capacity of variational autoencoders to disentangle the latent space of fundus images, with an aim to obtain a more robust and adaptable domain-invariant representation that effectively tackles the domain shift encountered in DR datasets. Despite the simplicity of our approach, we explore the efficacy of this classical method and demonstrate its ability to outperform contemporary state-of-the-art approaches for this task using publicly available datasets. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that highly sophisticated methods for DR classification are inherently superior for domain generalization.

Fundoscopic images are valuable resources for developing artificial intelligence systems to aid in the diagnosis and management of eye conditions. This paper focuses on enhancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning-based retinal image classification systems. A diverse and large-scale dataset of approximately 100,000 retinal images was utilized, along with a complex machine learning model. The study employed multiple datasets, including Kim's Eye Hospital, Drishti-GS1, DR HAGIS, APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection, ACRIMA, and Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 2015, to evaluate the performance of the model. Preprocessing techniques, including contrast enhancement and image resizing, were applied to prepare the dataset. The DenseNet121 model, which addresses the vanishing gradient problem, was used for transfer learning. The model created in this study can classify fundus images to three classes of Diabetic retinopathy, Glaucoma, and healthy eye with an average accuracy of 84.78%, a precision of 84.75%, and a recall of 84.76%. Although by training a model on a mild DR omitted dataset, these metrics increased significantly to an accuracy of 97.97%, a precision of 97.97%, and a recall of 97.96%.

The challenges and future trends including the use of multi-disease detection systems and smartphone RFI cameras are studied. This would be a game changer in screening programs and rural health centers and remote locations. Intelligent systems work as an effective and efficient tool to analyze RFI and assist healthcare specialists in diagnosing, triaging, and screening for a variety of diseases. More testing and better models need to be introduced to enhance the performance metrics further. More medical image datasets need to be available in the public domain to encourage further research.

However, diagnosing DR through manual examination of fundus images is both costly and time-consuming due to the need for trained medical professionals.

However, studies focusing on identifying the right disease among several candidates, which is a better approximation of clinical diagnosis in practice comparing with the case that aims to distinguish one particular eye disease from normal controls, are limited. The performance of existing algorithms for multi-class classification of fundus images is at most mediocre. Moreover, in many studies consisting of different eye diseases, labeled images are quite limited mainly due to privacy concern of patients. In this case, it is infeasible to train huge DCNNs, which usually have millions of parameters.

We also apply a visualization approach to highlight the loci that are most related to the disease labels to make the model more explainable.

This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases.

The use of AI models solely trained on large multi-institutional datasets can help with this, yet the imperative to ensure data privacy remains, particularly as membership inference risks breaching patient confidentiality. As a proposed remedy, we advocate for the integration of differential privacy (DP). We specifically investigate the performance of models trained with DP as compared to models trained without DP on data from institutions that the model had not seen during its training (i.e., external validation) - the situation that is reflective of the clinical use of AI models. By leveraging more than 590,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we evaluated the efficacy of DP-enhanced domain transfer (DP-DT) in diagnosing cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, pneumonia, atelectasis, and in identifying healthy subjects. We juxtaposed DP-DT with non-DP-DT and examined diagnostic accuracy and demographic fairness using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the main metric, as well as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results show that DP-DT, even with exceptionally high privacy levels (epsilon around 1), performs comparably to non-DP-DT (P>0.119 across all domains). Furthermore, DP-DT led to marginal AUC differences - less than 1% - for nearly all subgroups, relative to non-DP-DT. Despite consistent evidence suggesting that DP models induce significant performance degradation for on-domain applications, we show that off-domain performance is almost not affected. Therefore, we ardently advocate for the adoption of DP in training diagnostic medical AI models, given its minimal impact on performance.

It is mandatory to evaluate the strength of CNN models used in medical tasks against adversarial attacks especially in healthcare, that is to say, the security of such models is becoming extremely relevant to the diagnosis as this latter will guide high-stakes decision-making. However, little study has been conducted to better comprehend this issue. This paper focuses on MobileNet CNN architecture in order to investigate its vulnerability against fast gradient sign methods (FGSM) adversarial attacks. For this end, a Neural Structure Learning (NSL) and a Multi-Head Attention (MHA) have been used to effectively reduce the vulnerability against attack by end-to-end CNN training with adversarial neighbors that produce adversarial perturbations on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. With suggested model NSL-MHA-CNN, there has been an ability to maintain model performance on adversarial attack without increasing cost of training. Through theoretical assistance and empirical validation, it was possible to examine the stability of MobileNet architecture and demonstrate its susceptibility, particularly to adversarial attack. The experiments in this paper show that indiscernible degrees of perturbation $\varepsilon < 0.01$ were sufficient to cause a task failure resulting to misclassification in majority of the time.

It has become a severe problem among the working-age group that needs to be solved early to avoid vision loss in the future. Artificial intelligence-based technologies have been utilized to detect and grade diabetic retinopathy at the initial level. Early detection allows for proper treatment and, as a result, eyesight complications can be avoided. The in-depth analysis now details the various methods for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy using blood vessels, microaneurysms, exudates, macula, optic discs, and hemorrhages. In most trials, fundus images of the retina are used, which are taken using a fundus camera. This survey discusses the basics of diabetes, its prevalence, complications, and artificial intelligence approaches to deal with the early detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy. The research also discusses artificial intelligence-based techniques such as machine learning and deep learning. New research fields such as transfer learning using generative adversarial networks, domain adaptation, multitask learning, and explainable artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy are also considered. A list of existing datasets, screening systems, performance measurements, biomarkers in diabetic retinopathy, potential issues, and challenges faced in ophthalmology, followed by the future scope conclusion, is discussed. To the author, no other literature has analyzed recent state-of-the-art techniques considering the PRISMA approach and artificial intelligence as the core.","In this article , the authors discuss the basics of diabetes, its prevalence, complications, and artificial intelligence-based approaches to deal with the early detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy."

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images provide detailed insights into the retinal vasculature, revealing intricate changes that occur as DR progresses. However, interpreting these complex images requires significant expertise and is often time-intensive. Deep learning techniques have the potential to automate DR analysis. However, they typically require large datasets for effective training. To address the challenge of limited data in this emerging imaging field, a combined approach using few-shot learning (FSL) and self-attention mechanisms within explainable AI (XAI) was explored. Objective: To investigate and evaluate the potential of an FSL-self-attention XAI approach to improve the accuracy of DR staging classification using OCTA images. Methods: A total of 206 OCTA images, comprising 104 non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and 102 proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) cases, were analyzed using the FSL method. Three pre-trained networks (ResNet-50, DenseNet-161, and MobileNet-v2) were employed, with the top-performing model subsequently integrated with the Match-Them-Up Network (MTUNet) to provide explainable interpretations using a self-attention mechanism. The performance of the models was evaluated by applying standard metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The performance of the MTUNet model is assessed by calculating pattern-matching scores for PDR and NPDR classes. Results: The ResNet-50 pre-trained model in FSL demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving an accuracy of 76.17%, a sensitivity of 81.83%, a specificity of 70.5%, and 0.82 AUC in classifying DR stages. MTUNet provided pattern-matching scores of 0.77 and 0.75 for PDR and NPDR classes, respectively. Conclusions: FSL and self-attention mechanisms in XAI offer promising approaches for accurate DR stage classification, especially in data-limited scenarios. This could potentially facilitate early DR detection and inform clinical decision-making.

Without early detection, it can affect the retina and may eventually cause permanent blindness. The early diagnosis of DR is crucial for its treatment. However, the diagnosis of DR is a very difficult process that requires an experienced ophthalmologist. A breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence called deep learning can help in giving the ophthalmologist a second opinion regarding the classification of the DR by using an autonomous classifier. To accurately train a deep learning model to classify DR, an enormous number of images is required, and this is an important limitation in the DR domain. Transfer learning is a technique that can help in overcoming the scarcity of images. The main idea that is exploited by transfer learning is that a deep learning architecture, previously trained on non-medical images, can be fine-tuned to suit the DR dataset. This paper reviews research papers that focus on DR classification by using transfer learning to present the best existing methods to address this problem. This review can help future researchers to find out existing transfer learning methods to address the DR classification task and to show their differences in terms of performance.","This work states that transfer learning with convolutional neural networks for diabetic retinopathy image classification with real-time reinforcement learning is feasible and effective and should be implemented in clinical practice."

Research-oriented solutions have proven effective in classifying images with or without DR, but often fail to address the true need of the clinic - referring only those who need to be seen by a specialist, and reading every single case. In this work, we leverage an array of image pre-preprocessing techniques, as well as Transfer Learning to re-purpose an existing deep network for our tasks in DR. We train, test, and validate our system on 979 clinical cases, achieving a 95% Area Under the Curve (AUC) for referring Severe DR with an equal error Sensitivity and Specificity of 90%. Our system does not reject any images based on their quality, and is agnostic in terms of eye side and field.

Traditional methods for analyzing retinal fundus images are often manual, prolonged, and rely on the expertise of the clinician, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have introduced automated systems to assist in retinal disease detection; however, challenges such as computational inefficiency and robustness still remain. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes vision transformers (ViT) through transfer learning to address challenges in ophthalmic diagnostics. Using a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, we fine-tune it for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) classification tasks. To adapt the model for retinal fundus images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts the images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them, ensuring compatibility with the ViT architecture and improving model performance. We validated our model, OcuViT, on two datasets. We used the APTOS dataset to perform binary and five-level severity classification and the IChallenge-AMD dataset for grading age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the five-class DR and AMD grading tasks, OcuViT outperforms all existing CNN- and ViT-based methods across multiple metrics, achieving superior accuracy and robustness. For the binary DR task, it delivers highly competitive performance. These results demonstrate that OcuViT effectively leverages ViT-based transfer learning with an efficient preprocessing pipeline, significantly improving the precision and reliability of automated ophthalmic diagnosis.

FL is used to train machine learning algorithms on decentralized data. Electronic health records, which hold private patient data, are one type of such data. In FL, local models are trained, and the model parameters are then combined on a central server instead of sharing sensitive data. But this approach poses privacy risks, so before disclosing the model parameters, privacy protection measures such data confidentiality must be put in existence. During the pandemic, there is a need to improve the healthcare system. Numerous advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology are continuously being utilized in several healthcare domains. Federated Learning (FL), one such development, has gained popularity mostly because of its decentralized, cooperative approach to creating AI models. Since integrating privacy algorithms can affect the utility, it is important to strike a balance when it comes to privacy and utility in FL research. The goal is to use strategies such as data generalizing, feature selection for reducing dimensions, and reduction in the confidentiality process to maximize FL's effectiveness while preserving privacy. To create a predictive model for healthcare applications, this study also explores the idea of segmenting data based on attributes rather than records.

The aim of this study was to analyze the usefulness of artificial intelligence in the detection of diabetic retinopathy. For this purpose, an exploratory systematic review was performed, collecting 77 empirical articles from the Scopus, IEEE, ACM, SciELO and NIH databases. The results indicate that the most commonly used factors for the detection of diabetic retinopathy include changes in retinal vascularization, macular edema and microaneurysms. Among the most commonly applied algorithms for early detection are ResNet 101, CNN and IDx-DR. In addition, some artificial intelligence models are reported to have an accuracy ranging from 90% to 95%, although models with accuracies below 80% have also been identified. It is concluded that artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning, has been shown to be effective in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, facilitating timely treatment and improving clinical outcomes. However, ethical and legal concerns arise, such as privacy and security of patient data, liability in case of diagnostic errors, algorithmic bias, informed consent, and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence.

There has been keen interest to apply deep learning in the medical domain, particularly specialties that heavily utilize imaging, such as ophthalmology. One issue that may hinder application of deep learning to the medical domain is the vast amount of data necessary to train deep neural networks (DNNs). Because of regulatory and privacy issues associated with medicine, and the generally proprietary nature of data in medical domains, obtaining large datasets to train DNNs is a challenge, particularly in the ophthalmology domain. 
Transfer learning is a technique developed to address the issue of applying DNNs for domains with limited data. Prior reports on transfer learning have examined custom networks to fully train or used a particular DNN for transfer learning. However, to the best of my knowledge, no work has systematically examined a suite of DNNs for transfer learning for classification of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and two key features of age-related macular degeneration. This work attempts to investigate transfer learning for classification of these ophthalmic conditions. Part I gives a condensed overview of neural networks and the DNNs under evaluation. Part II gives the reader the necessary background concerning diabetic retinopathy and prior work on classification using retinal fundus photographs. The methodology and results of transfer learning for diabetic retinopathy classification are presented, showing that transfer learning towards this domain is feasible, with promising accuracy.

This paper reviews recent advances and challenges in applying AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to major eye diseases. In diabetic retinopathy, AI algorithms analyze retinal images to accurately identify lesions, which helps clinicians in ophthalmology practice. Systems like IDx- DR (IDx Technologies Inc, USA) are FDA-approved for autonomous detection of referable diabetic retinopathy. For glaucoma, deep learning models assess optic nerve head morphology in fundus photographs to detect damage. In age-related macular degeneration, AI can quantify drusen and diagnose disease severity from both color fundus and optical coherence tomography images. AI has also been used in screening for retinopathy of prematurity, keratoconus, and dry eye disease. Beyond screening, AI can aid treatment decisions by forecasting disease progression and anti- VEGF response. However, potential limitations such as the quality and diversity of training data, lack of rigorous clinical validation, and challenges in regulatory approval and clinician trust must be addressed for the widespread adoption of AI. Two other significant hurdles include the integration of AI into existing clinical workflows and ensuring transparency in AI decisionmaking processes. With continued research to address these limitations, AI promises to enable earlier diagnosis, optimized resource allocation, personalized treatment, and improved patient outcomes. Besides, synergistic human-AI systems could set a new standard for evidence-based, precise ophthalmic care.

In particular, self-supervised models show further benefits to supervised models. Self-supervised models with initialization from ImageNet pretraining not only report higher performance, they also reduce overfitting to large lesions along with improvements in taking into account minute lesions indicative of the progression of the disease.

Although adequate management of DM via regular eye examination can preserve vision in in 98% of the DR cases, DR screening and diagnoses based on clinical lesion features devised by expert clinicians; are costly, time-consuming and not sufficiently accurate. This raises the requirements for Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems which can accurately detect DR automatically and thus preventing DR before affecting vision. Hence, such systems can help clinician experts in certain cases and aid ophthalmologists in rapid diagnoses. To address such requirements, several approaches have been proposed in the literature that use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to develop such systems. However, these approaches ignore the highly valuable clinical lesion features that could contribute significantly to the accurate detection of DR. Therefore, in this study we introduce a framework called DR-detector that employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML model trained via the combination of the features extracted by the pretrained convolutional neural networks commonly known as transfer learning (TL) models and the clinical retinal lesion features for accurate detection of DR. The retinal lesion features are extracted via image segmentation technique using the UNET DL model and captures exudates (EXs), microaneurysms (MAs), and hemorrhages (HEMs) that are relevant lesions for DR detection. The feature combination approach implemented in DR-detector has been applied to two common TL models in the literature namely VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We trained the DR-detector model using a training dataset comprising of 1,840 color fundus images collected from e-ophtha, retinal lesions and APTOS 2019 Kaggle datasets of which 920 images are healthy. To validate the DR-detector model, we test the model on external dataset that consists of 81 healthy images collected from High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) dataset and MESSIDOR-2 datasets and 81 images with DR signs collected from Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) dataset annotated for DR by expert. The experimental results show that the DR-detector model achieves a testing accuracy of 100% in detecting DR after training it with the combination of ResNet-50 and lesion features and 99.38% accuracy after training it with the combination of VGG-16 and lesion features. More importantly, the results also show a higher contribution of specific lesion features toward the performance of the DR-detector model. For instance, using only the hemorrhages feature to train the model, our model achieves an accuracy of 99.38 in detecting DR, which is higher than the accuracy when training the model with the combination of all lesion features (89%) and equal to the accuracy when training the model with the combination of all lesions and VGG-16 features together. This highlights the possibility of using only the clinical features, such as lesions that are clinically interpretable, to build the next generation of robust artificial intelligence (AI) systems with great clinical interpretability for DR detection. The code of the DR-detector framework is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Janga-Lab/DR-detector and can be readily employed for detecting DR from retinal image datasets.","A framework called DR-detector is introduced that employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML model trained via the combination of the features extracted by the pretrained convolutional neural networks commonly known as transfer learning (TL) models and the clinical retinal lesion features for accurate detection of DR."

Diabetic retinopathy is the root cause of more than 1% of the blindness worldwide. Early detection of this disease is crucial as it prevents it from progressing to a more severe level. However, the current machine learning-based approaches for detecting the severity level of diabetic retinopathy are either, i) rely on manually extracting features which makes an approach unpractical, or ii) trained on small dataset thus cannot be generalized. In this study, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for detecting the severity level of the diabetic retinopathy with high accuracy. Our model is a deep learning model based on global average pooling (GAP) technique with various pre-trained convolutional neural net- work (CNN) models.

Diabetic Retinopathy damages the retina's delicate blood vessels leading to blurred vision, dark spots in vision, retinal detachment and ultimately vision loss. To address this concern, we implemented a study to explore the possibilities for automated DR detection using advanced deep learning techniques. We assessed four models namely, EfficientNet-B5, ResNet152V2, EfficientNet-B6 and MobileNetV2, on the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) dataset of retinal images.

Without early diagnosis and treatment, it can lead to vision loss. The objective of this study is to investigate diverse methodologies to address the class imbalance issue in the retinal fundus image dataset and apply transformer-based knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient DR detection. Various deep-learning models have been implemented to classify RGB fundus images into five distinct classes of DR. The retinal fundus images of the employed APTOS dataset were classified using the following models: ResNet34, DenseNet121, GoogLeNet MobileViTv2, DeiT3, and KD. Initial training on the imbalanced APTOS dataset showed promising results, but to explore a more robust approach, two data balancing approaches were used, namely cost-sensitive learning and data augmentation. It was found that MobileViTv2 achieved the best results with the APTOS cost-sensitive learning approach, achieving a kappa score of 0.94 and a macro F1 score of 0.73. Furthermore, the KD technique with MobileViTv2 as a teacher and GoogLeNet as a student model achieved a WKS of 0.90 with significantly fewer parameters than the teacher model. Finally, the automatic predictions of the deep learning models are interpreted using the SHAP explainable AI framework. These findings suggest that the cost-sensitive approach and lightweight KD model can substantially enhance the performance of the implemented deep learning models for DR detection in memory-constrained healthcare devices.","This study investigates transformer-based knowledge distillation and explainable AI for diabetic retinopathy detection, achieving a kappa score of 0.94 and macro F1 score of 0.73 with cost-sensitive learning and a lightweight KD model, improving performance in memory-constrained devices."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, at least 1 billion people suffer from near or distance vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. These conditions cause difficulty in living a healthy lifestyle and impair individual quality of life. The article explores the application of federated learning in detecting two vision-threatening ocular diseases- diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. A federated learning framework enhances the technological capabilities of artificial intelligence that leverages decentralised data sources without creating data banks to maintain privacy. The methodology implements a federated learning environment with 2, 3, and 4 clients, using MobileNetV2 as the backbone deep learning model. The model is trained on a composite of 2 datasets procured from the Kaggle repository, comprising coloured fundus images labelled for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and normal cases. The federated learning process involves training at the client end to build client models called local models. The clients in a federated learning system only share updates regarding their local models. The original data is never shared with a central server. The server integrates these local models into the central global models using aggregation strategies such as FedAvg, FedProx, etc. Performance metrics, including prediction accuracy, class-wise accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are calculated across 30 communication rounds. The results demonstrate that the federated learning model achieves an average prediction accuracy of 96%, and a class-wise accuracy of 100% in detecting diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. The high performance of the federated learning system highlights the significance of federated learning as a viable solution for ocular disease detection while ensuring data privacy.

The present AI medical models' inability to generalize when exposed to clinical data and the dearth of labelled medical data from which they can learn are also causes for concern. In a non-clinical setting, these methods have demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity for identifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The task of determining the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is studied in this research by fine-tuning the network to investigate the influence of transfer learning. Due of the numerous difficulties associated with medical annotation and privacy concerns, this study tests the automatic classification of diabetic retinopathy using the updated, fine-tuned ResNet50 model on the APTOS2019 dataset. Proposed Transfer learning approach outperforms existing methods in terms of Classification Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score. The proposed model achieves better results even with a smaller fraction of data, faster training and low computational resources, It's a strong point in favour of its novelty. In this study, the network is fine-tuned to examine the impact of transfer learning on the downstream task of assessing the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR).

Indicative significance of DR forecast and evaluation to help the ophthalmologists in standard screening has prompted the improvement of computerized DR recognition frameworks. This work focuses on automatic DR disease identification and its grading by the means of transfer learning approach using dynamic investigation. Our proposed approach utilizes deep neural network for feature extraction from fundus images and these features are further ensembled with supervised machine learning technique for DR grading. An optimized classification is achieved by applying an ensemble of convolution neural networks (CNNs) with statistical feature selection module and SVM classifier. The learning of classifier is achieved by the feature information transferred from CNN model to the SVM classifier, which results in remarkable performance of the learned models. Statistically optimized feature set utilized for transfer learning technique yields in the classification accuracy of 90.51% with proposed Prominent Feature-based Transfer Learning (PFTL) method employing Inception V3 model.

Despite considering certain clinical requirements, like source data privacy, conventional transfer methods are predominantly model-centered and often struggle to prevent model-targeted attacks. In this paper, we address a challenging Online Model-aGnostic Domain Adaptation (OMG-DA) setting, driven by the demands of clinical environments. This setting is characterized by the absence of the model and the flow of target data. To tackle the new challenge, we propose a novel approach, Generative Unadversarial ExampleS (GUES), which enables adaptation from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first theoretically reformulate conventional perturbation optimization in a generative way--learning a perturbation generation function with a latent input variable. During model instantiation, we leverage a Variational AutoEncoder to express this function. The encoder with the reparameterization trick predicts the latent input, whilst the decoder is responsible for the generation. Furthermore, the saliency map is selected as pseudo-perturbation labels. Because it not only captures potential lesions but also theoretically provides an upper bound on the function input, enabling the identification of the latent variable. Extensive comparative experiments on DR benchmarks with both frozen pre-trained models and trainable models demonstrate the superiority of GUES, showing robustness even with small batch size.

The risk of vision loss can be considerably decreased with early detection and treatment of DR.

However, this transformation has given rise to concerns about the fairness of AI, which disproportionately affects certain groups, particularly patients from underprivileged populations. Recently, a number of methods and large-scale datasets have been proposed to address group performance disparities. Although these methods have shown effectiveness in disease classification tasks, they may fall short in ensuring fair prediction of disease progression, mainly because of limited longitudinal data with diverse demographics available for training a robust and equitable prediction model. In this paper, we introduce TransFair to enhance demographic fairness in progression prediction for ocular diseases. TransFair aims to transfer a fairness-enhanced disease classification model to the task of progression prediction with fairness preserved. Specifically, we train a fair EfficientNet, termed FairEN, equipped with a fairness-aware attention mechanism using extensive data for ocular disease classification. Subsequently, this fair classification model is adapted to a fair progression prediction model through knowledge distillation, which aims to minimize the latent feature distances between the classification and progression prediction models. We evaluate FairEN and TransFair for fairness-enhanced ocular disease classification and progression prediction using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D retinal images. Extensive experiments and comparisons with models with and without considering fairness learning show that TransFair effectively enhances demographic equity in predicting ocular disease progression.

Additionally, data sharing is key to fully realizing the potential of machine learning models by providing a rich and diverse collection of training data. However, the personally-identifying nature of retinal images, encompassing the unique vascular structure of each individual, often prevents this data from being shared openly. While prior works have explored image de-identification strategies based on synthetic averaging of images in other domains (e.g. facial images), existing techniques face difficulty in preserving both privacy and clinical utility in retinal images, as we demonstrate in our work. We therefore introduce k-SALSA, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework for synthesizing retinal fundus images that summarize a given private dataset while satisfying the privacy notion of k-anonymity. k-SALSA brings together state-of-the-art techniques for training and inverting GANs to achieve practical performance on retinal images. Furthermore, k-SALSA leverages a new technique, called local style alignment, to generate a synthetic average that maximizes the retention of fine-grain visual patterns in the source images, thus improving the clinical utility of the generated images. On two benchmark datasets of diabetic retinopathy (EyePACS and APTOS), we demonstrate our improvement upon existing methods with respect to image fidelity, classification performance, and mitigation of membership inference attacks.

An automated ocular disease detection system with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools is required to recognize eye-related diseases.

This paper explores the emerging field of privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) as a critical approach to safeguarding patient confidentiality while enabling the effective analysis of EHRs. We systematically review various PPML techniques, including differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and federated learning, assessing their applicability in the context of healthcare data. Differential privacy is examined as a method for adding controlled noise to data outputs, ensuring that the contributions of individual patients cannot be easily inferred. We discuss its implementation challenges, particularly in maintaining the trade-off between data utility and privacy guarantees. Homomorphic encryption, which allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts, is analyzed for its capacity to secure sensitive health information during model training and inference. However, we highlight the computational complexity and resource demands associated with this technique, which may limit its practical application in real-world healthcare settings. Federated learning emerges as a promising paradigm that enables decentralized model training across multiple institutions, allowing EHRs to remain localized and secure. This section delves into the benefits of federated learning in facilitating collaborative research while addressing the challenges of communication overhead and model performance. We also consider hybrid approaches that combine multiple privacy-preserving techniques to enhance security without significantly compromising model accuracy.

Screening for DR is recommended in children and adolescents, but adherence is poor. Recently, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed for early detection of DR and have been included in the American Diabetes Association’s guidelines for screening in adults. We sought to determine the diagnostic efficacy of autonomous AI for the diabetic eye exam in youth with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this prospective study, point-of-care diabetic eye exam was implemented using a nonmydriatic fundus camera with an autonomous AI system for detection of DR in a multidisciplinary pediatric diabetes center. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosability of AI was compared with consensus grading by retinal specialists, who were masked to AI output. Adherence to screening guidelines was measured before and after AI implementation. RESULTS Three hundred ten youth with diabetes aged 5–21 years were included, of whom 4.2% had DR. Diagnosability of AI was 97.5% (302 of 310). The sensitivity and specificity of AI to detect more-than-mild DR was 85.7% (95% CI 42.1–99.6%) and 79.3% (74.3–83.8%), respectively, compared with the reference standard as defined by retina specialists. Adherence improved from 49% to 95% after AI implementation. CONCLUSIONS Use of a nonmydriatic fundus camera with autonomous AI was safe and effective for the diabetic eye exam in youth in our study.

Early detection and treatment of DR is critical for saving vision and preventing blindness. To address the need for increased DR detection and referrals, we evaluated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for screening DR. Methods: Patient images were obtained using a 45-degree Canon Non-Mydriatic CR-2 Plus AF retinal camera in the Department of Endocrinology Clinic (Newark, NJ) and in a community screening event (Newark, NJ). Images were initially classified by an on-site grader and uploaded for analysis by EyeArt, a cloud-based AI software developed by Eyenuk (California, USA). The images were also graded by an off-site retina specialist. Using Fleiss kappa analysis, a correlation was investigated between the three grading systems, the AI, onsite grader, and a US board-certified retina specialist, for a diagnosis of DR and referral pattern. Results: The EyeArt results, onsite grader, and the retina specialist had a 79% overall agreement on the diagnosis of DR. The kappa value for concordance on a diagnosis was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61-0.77), indicating substantial agreement. Referral patterns by EyeArt, the onsite grader, and the ophthalmologist had an 85% overall agreement. The kappa value for concordance on “whether to refer” was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60-0.80), indicating substantial agreement. Conclusions: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis offers insights into use of AI in diabetic screenings and the significant role it will play in automated detection of DR.

Despite many improvements in diabetic care, DM remains a leading cause of visual impairment in working-age patients. So far, prevention has been the best way to protect vision. The sooner we diagnose DED, the more effective the treatment is. Thus, diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, especially with imaging techniques, is a method of choice for vision protection. To alleviate the burden of diabetic patients who need ophthalmic care, telemedicine and in-home testing are used, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This is why we decided to evaluate current image teleophthalmology methods used for DR screening. We searched the PubMed platform for papers published over the last 5 years (2015–2020) using the following key words: telemedicine in diabetic retinopathy screening, diabetic retinopathy screening, automated diabetic retinopathy screening, artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy screening, smartphone diabetic retinopathy testing. We have included 118 original articles meeting the above criteria, discussing imaging diabetic retinopathy screening methods. We have found that fundus cameras, stable or mobile, are most commonly used for retinal photography, with portable fundus cameras also relatively common. Other possibilities involve the use of ultra-wide-field (UWF) imaging and even optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices for DR screening. Also, the role of smartphones is increasingly recognized in the field. Retinal fundus images are assessed by humans instantly or remotely, while AI algorithms seem to be useful tools facilitating retinal image assessment. The common use of smartphones and availability of relatively cheap, easy-to-use adapters for retinal photographs augmented by AI algorithms make it possible for eye fundus photographs to be taken by non-specialists and in non-medical setting. This opens the way for in-home testing conducted on a much larger scale in the future. In conclusion, based on current DR screening techniques, we can suggest that the future practice of eye care specialists will be widely supported by AI algorithms, and this way will be more effective.","In this article, the authors evaluate current image teleophthalmology methods used for diabetic retinopathy screening and suggest that the future practice of eye care specialists will be widely supported by AI algorithms, and this way will be more effective."

AI algorithms can recognize diabetes signs and give patients and healthcare providers early warnings by examining a variety of data sources, such as medical records, patient histories, and lifestyle factors. AI's capacity to evaluate sizable and intricate datasets is one of its main advantages in the diagnosis of diabetes. AI is capable of taking into account a broad range of variables that could lead to diabetes, such as age, BMI, food preferences, physical activity, and genetic predisposition. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can recognize early indicators of diabetes and forecast the risk of developing the condition by analysing patterns and relationships among these variables. AI can also be applied to customize diabetic care and screening. Healthcare providers can improve patient outcomes and lessen the burden of disease by customizing suggestions and treatment options for each patient. AI can assess a patient's risk of diabetes by looking into their lifestyle choices and medical history. Healthcare providers can focus treatments and preventative actions to lower the chance of illness onset by identifying high-risk individuals can identify early indicators of diabetes by analysing blood glucose levels, demographic data, and lifestyle factors. Because of this, medical practitioners may be able to intervene early on, when the illness is most amenable to treatment systems that can monitor blood glucose levels and examine patient histories to create customized diabetic treatment programs. This can involve individualized prescription schedules, workout programs, and food advice.

Amir Hayeri","10.2196/18660","","Background: Diabetes mellitus, which causes dysregulation of blood glucose in humans, is a major public health challenge. Patients with diabetes must monitor their glycemic levels to keep them in a healthy range. This task is made easier by using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and relaying their output to smartphone apps, thus providing users with real-time information on their glycemic fluctuations and possibly predicting future trends.
Objective: This study aims to discuss various challenges of predictive monitoring of glycemia and examines the accuracy and blood glucose control effects of Diabits, a smartphone app that helps patients with diabetes monitor and manage their blood glucose levels in real time.
Methods: Using data from CGM devices and user input, Diabits applies machine learning techniques to create personalized patient models and predict blood glucose fluctuations up to 60 min in advance. These predictions give patients an opportunity to take pre-emptive action to maintain their blood glucose values within the reference range. In this retrospective observational cohort study, the predictive accuracy of Diabits and the correlation between daily use of the app and blood glucose control metrics were examined based on real app users’ data. Moreover, the accuracy of predictions on the 2018 Ohio T1DM (type 1 diabetes mellitus) data set was calculated and compared against other published results.
Results: On the basis of more than 6.8 million data points, 30-min Diabits predictions evaluated using Parkes Error Grid were found to be 86.89% (5,963,930/6,864,130) clinically accurate (zone A) and 99.56% (6,833,625/6,864,130) clinically acceptable (zones A and B), whereas 60-min predictions were 70.56% (4,843,605/6,864,130) clinically accurate and 97.49% (6,692,165/6,864,130) clinically acceptable. By analyzing daily use statistics and CGM data for the 280 most long-standing users of Diabits, it was established that under free-living conditions, many common blood glucose control metrics improved with increased frequency of app use. For instance, the average blood glucose for the days these users did not interact with the app was 154.0 (SD 47.2) mg/dL, with 67.52% of the time spent in the healthy 70 to 180 mg/dL range. For days with 10 or more Diabits sessions, the average blood glucose decreased to 141.6 (SD 42.0) mg/dL (P<.001), whereas the time in euglycemic range increased to 74.28% (P<.001). On the Ohio T1DM data set of 6 patients with type 1 diabetes, 30-min predictions of the base Diabits model had an average root mean square error of 18.68 (SD 2.19) mg/dL, which is an improvement over the published state-of-the-art results for this data set.
Conclusions: Diabits accurately predicts future glycemic fluctuations, potentially making it easier for patients with diabetes to maintain their blood glucose in the reference range. Furthermore, an improvement in glucose control was observed on days with more frequent Diabits use.

Digital health care interventions (DHIs) can provide scalable care, fostering diabetes self-management and reducing the risk of complications. Tailorability (providing personalized interventions) and usability are key to DHI engagement/effectiveness. User-centered design of DHIs (aligning features to end users’ needs) can generate more usable interventions, avoiding unintended consequences and improving user engagement. OBJECTIVE MyDiabetesIQ (MDIQ) is an artificial intelligence engine intended to predict users’ diabetes complications risk. It will underpin a user interface in which users will alter lifestyle parameters to see the impact on their future risks. MDIQ will link to an existing DHI, My Diabetes My Way (MDMW). We describe the user-centered design of the user interface of MDIQ as informed by human factors engineering. METHODS Current users of MDMW were invited to take part in focus groups to gather their insights about users being shown their likelihood of developing diabetes-related complications and any risks they perceived from using MDIQ. Findings from focus groups informed the development of a prototype MDIQ interface, which was then user-tested through the “think aloud” method, in which users speak aloud about their thoughts/impressions while performing prescribed tasks. Focus group and think aloud transcripts were analyzed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive analysis. For think aloud data, a sociotechnical model was used as a framework for thematic analysis. RESULTS Focus group participants (n=8) felt that some users could become anxious when shown their future complications risks. They highlighted the importance of easy navigation, jargon avoidance, and the use of positive/encouraging language. User testing of the prototype site through think aloud sessions (n=7) highlighted several usability issues. Issues included confusing visual cues and confusion over whether user-updated information fed back to health care teams. Some issues could be compounded for users with limited digital skills. Results from the focus groups and think aloud workshops were used in the development of a live MDIQ platform. CONCLUSIONS Acting on the input of end users at each iterative stage of a digital tool’s development can help to prioritize users throughout the design process, ensuring the alignment of DHI features with user needs. The use of the sociotechnical framework encouraged the consideration of interactions between different sociotechnical dimensions in finding solutions to issues, for example, avoiding the exclusion of users with limited digital skills. Based on user feedback, the tool could scaffold good goal setting, allowing users to balance their palatable future complications risk against acceptable lifestyle changes.

The growth in the capabilities of telehealth have made it possible to identify individuals with a higher risk of uncontrolled diabetes and provide them with targeted support and resources to help them manage their condition. Thus, predictive modeling has emerged as a valuable tool for the advancement of diabetes management.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to conceptualize and develop a novel machine learning (ML) approach to proactively identify participants enrolled in a remote diabetes monitoring program (RDMP) who were at risk of uncontrolled diabetes at 12 months in the program.


METHODS
Registry data from the Livongo for Diabetes RDMP were used to design separate dynamic predictive ML models to predict participant outcomes at each monthly checkpoint of the participants' program journey (month-n models) from the first day of onboarding (month-0 model) up to the 11th month (month-11 model). A participant's program journey began upon onboarding into the RDMP and monitoring their own blood glucose (BG) levels through the RDMP-provided BG meter. Each participant passed through 12 predicative models through their first year enrolled in the RDMP. Four categories of participant attributes (ie, survey data, BG data, medication fills, and health signals) were used for feature construction. The models were trained using the light gradient boosting machine and underwent hyperparameter tuning. The performance of the models was evaluated using standard metrics, including precision, recall, specificity, the area under the curve, the F1-score, and accuracy.


RESULTS
The ML models exhibited strong performance, accurately identifying observable at-risk participants, with recall ranging from 70% to 94% and precision from 40% to 88% across the 12-month program journey. Unobservable at-risk participants also showed promising performance, with recall ranging from 61% to 82% and precision from 42% to 61%. Overall, model performance improved as participants progressed through their program journey, demonstrating the importance of engagement data in predicting long-term clinical outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS

Early detection and timely treatment of DR are crucial to prevent irreversible damage. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques have shown promising results in automating the detection of DR from retinal images. This paper presents an automatic modeling approach for diabetic retinopathy detection, leveraging the power of AI and deep learning. The proposed method utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed to analyze retinal images and classify them into different stages of diabetic retinopathy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available diabetic retinopathy dataset. The model's accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other performance metrics are assessed using standard evaluation protocols. The results demonstrate that the proposed automatic modeling approach achieves highly accurate and reliable diabetic retinopathy detection. The model shows excellent performance in distinguishing different stages of DR, enabling early intervention and appropriate treatment strategies.

Early visual impairment can be averted by monitoring and treating diabetes. Many scientists have developed machine learning techniques to detect DR earlier. Model results proved their usefulness. A WHO research predicts that 40–45% of the world's 347 million diabetics have DR. Early DR diagnosis and therapy can substantially slow visual loss. Current DR detection approaches entail skilled doctors manually analysing digital fundus images, which can cause miscommunication and postpone therapy. This study grades DR intensity as mild, moderate, or severe. A new AI model uses support vector machines and Vgg-16 to classify DR.

Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for preventing irreversible vision loss. However, traditional methods of DR screening are labor-intensive and reliant on the availability of skilled personnel, posing challenges in resource-constrained settings. Objective This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting the severity of DR compared to conventional ophthalmological assessments. METHODS A hospital-based observational study was conducted at the ophthalmology outpatient department of Tertiary care hospital, India over a six-month period. A total of 300 diabetic patients were included, and fundus photographs were obtained using a fundus camera. The images were then analyzed using an AI model trained on a diabetic retinopathy dataset. The severity of DR was graded according to established criteria, and the accuracy of the AI model was compared to that of ophthalmologist grading. RESULTS The AI model demonstrated an accuracy rate of 95.25% in grading the severity of DR. Comparison between AI and ophthalmologist grading showed close sensitivity and specificity rates across different DR grades, with the AI model slightly outperforming in certain categories. CONCLUSIONS Artificial intelligence shows promise as an effective and efficient tool for the screening and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Its integration into healthcare systems could enhance early detection and treatment of DR, particularly in underserved regions with limited access to ophthalmological services.

Diabetic microvascular complications significantly impact morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) in predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN).


METHODS
A comprehensive PubMed search from 1990 to 2023 identified studies on ML/AI models for diabetic microvascular complications. The review analyzed study design, cohorts, predictors, ML techniques, prediction horizon, and performance metrics.


RESULTS
Among the 74 identified studies, 256 featured internally validated ML models and 124 had externally validated models, with about half being retrospective. Since 2010, there has been a rise in the use of ML for predicting microvascular complications, mainly driven by DKD research across 27 countries. A more modest increase in ML research on DR and DN was observed, with publications from fewer countries. For all microvascular complications, predictive models achieved a mean (standard deviation) c-statistic of 0.79 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.72 (0.12) on external validation. Diabetic kidney disease models had the highest discrimination, with c-statistics of 0.81 (0.09) on internal validation and 0.74 (0.13) on external validation, respectively. Few studies externally validated prediction of DN. The prediction horizon, outcome definitions, number and type of predictors, and ML technique significantly influenced model performance.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
There is growing global interest in using ML for predicting diabetic microvascular complications. Research on DKD is the most advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance. Both DR and DN require more research. External validation and adherence to recommended guidelines are crucial.","There is growing global interest in using ML for predicting diabetic microvascular complications, and research on DKD is the most advanced in terms of publication volume and overall prediction performance."

Hassan Ghasemzadeh","10.1109/bhi58575.2023.10313443","","Effective prevention and management of diabetes relies on maintaining a normal blood glucose level, thus avoiding abnormal events such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Predicting anomalous events beforehand can potentially help patients and caregivers intervene to prevent such events through modifiable behaviors such as exercise, diet, and medication. Although Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) sensors have been used to monitor and forecast blood glucose level, current research lacks a computational approach that recommends a behavioral intervention to bring the glucose level to a normal range. To address this shortcoming, we present GlySim1, a CGM simulator that uses multimodal data to not only forecast future glucose readings but also enable a user to examine the impacts of behavior change on glucose response in advance. GlySim creates opportunities for change in food consumption, medication, and physical activity to avoid dysglycemia by pinpointing factors that cause anomalous events using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and allowing users to observe how adjusting a behavioral factor changes glucose trajectories. We validate GlySim on a dataset of 10 patients with type 1 diabetes and achieve an overall mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 16.5 mg/dl in simulating glycemic response. Furthermore, GlySim detects hyperglycemic events with 0.89 average precision.","GlySim1 is presented, a CGM simulator that uses multimodal data to not only forecast future glucose readings but also enable a user to examine the impacts of behavior change on glucose response in advance and validate GlySim on a dataset of 10 patients with type 1 diabetes."

We propose a layered meta-learning approach based on multi-expert systems to predict adverse events in T1D. The base learner is composed of three deep neural networks and exploits only continuous glucose monitoring data as an input feature. Each network specializes in predicting whether the patient is about to experience hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia. The output of the experts is passed to a meta-learner to provide the final model classification. In addition, we formally introduce a novel parameter, $\alpha $ , to evaluate the advance by which a prediction is performed. We evaluate the proposed approach on both a public and a private dataset and implement it on an edge device to test its feasibility in real life. On average, on the Ohio T1DM dataset, our system was able to predict hypoglycemia events with a time gain of 22.8 minutes, hyperglycemia ones with an advance of 24.0 minutes. Our model not only outperforms presented models in the literature in terms of events predicted with sufficient advance, but also with regard to the number of false positives, achieving on average 0.45 and 0.46 hypo- and hyperglycemic false alarms per day, respectively. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach effectively improves performance in a new cohort of patients by training only the meta-learner with a limited amount of data. We believe our approach would be an essential ally for the patients to control the glycemic fluctuations and adjust their insulin therapy and dietary intakes, enabling them to speed up decision-making and improve personal self-management, resulting in a reduced risk of acute and chronic complications. As our last contribution, we assessed the validity of the approach by exploiting only blood glucose variations as well as in combination with the information of the insulin boluses, the skin temperature, and the galvanic skin response. In general, we have observed that providing other information but CGM leads to slightly lower performances with respect to considering CGM alone.","In this article , a layered meta-learning approach based on multi-expert systems was proposed to predict adverse events in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring data as an input feature."

Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020. Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners—which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions—frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and “deep learning” can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions.","Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications, and would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons."

 Real-time prediction of blood glucose levels (BGLs) in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) presents considerable challenges. Accordingly, we present a personalized multitasking framework aimed to forecast blood glucose levels in patients. The patient data was initially categorized according to gender and age and subsequently utilized as input for a modified GRU network model, creating five prediction sub-models. The model hyperparameters were optimized and tuned after introducing the decay factor and incorporating the TCN network and attention mechanism into the GRU model. This step was undertaken to improve the capability of feature extraction. The Ohio T1DM clinical dataset was used to train and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Clark Error Grid Analysis (EGA), were used to evaluate the performance. The results showed that the average RMSE and the MAE of the proposed model were 16.896 and 9.978 mg/dL, respectively, over the prediction horizon (PH) of 30 minutes. The average RMSE and the MAE were 28.881 and 19.347 mg/dL, respectively, over the PH of 60 min. The proposed model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy. In addition, the EGA analysis showed that the proposed model accurately predicted 30-minute and 60-minute PH within zones A and B, demonstrating that the framework is clinically feasible. The proposed personalized multitask prediction model in this study offers robust assistance for clinical decision-making, playing a pivotal role in improving the outcomes of individuals with diabetes.

This necessity has propelled the use of deep learning’s advanced analytical and predictive capabilities to the forefront of current research. However, this approach is confronted with significant challenges, notably the prevalence of incomplete data and the need for more robust predictive models. Our research aims to address these critical issues, leveraging deep learning to enhance the precision and reliability of diabetes progression predictions. We address the issue of missing data by first locating individuals with data gaps within specific patient clusters, and then applying targeted imputation strategies for effective data imputation. To enhance the robustness of our model, we implement strategies such as data augmentation and the development of advanced group-level feature analysis. A cornerstone of our approach is the implementation of a deep attentive transformer that is sensitive to group characteristics. This framework excels in processing a wide array of data, including clinical and physical examination information, to accurately predict the progression of DM. Beyond its predictive capabilities, our model is engineered to perform advanced feature selection and reasoning. This is crucial for understanding the impact of both individual and group-level factors on deep models’ predictions, providing invaluable insights into the dynamics of DM progression. Our approach not only marks a significant advancement in the prediction of diabetes progression but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing this chronic disease, thereby aiding in more effective diabetes management and research.

"Layered Meta-Learning Algorithm for Predicting Adverse Events in Type 1 Diabetes","https://scispace.com/paper/layered-meta-learning-algorithm-for-predicting-adverse-2s6qwjuk","2023","Journal Article","IEEE Access","","10.1109/access.2023.3237992","","Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic disease that, if not treated properly, can lead to serious complications. We propose a layered meta-learning approach based on multi-expert systems to predict adverse events in T1D. The base learner is composed of three deep neural networks and exploits only continuous glucose monitoring data as an input feature. Each network specializes in predicting whether the patient is about to experience hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia. The output of the experts is passed to a meta-learner to provide the final model classification. In addition, we formally introduce a novel parameter, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula> , to evaluate the advance by which a prediction is performed. We evaluate the proposed approach on both a public and a private dataset and implement it on an edge device to test its feasibility in real life. On average, on the Ohio T1DM dataset, our system was able to predict hypoglycemia events with a time gain of 22.8 minutes, hyperglycemia ones with an advance of 24.0 minutes. Our model not only outperforms presented models in the literature in terms of events predicted with sufficient advance, but also with regard to the number of false positives, achieving on average 0.45 and 0.46 hypo- and hyperglycemic false alarms per day, respectively. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach effectively improves performance in a new cohort of patients by training only the meta-learner with a limited amount of data. We believe our approach would be an essential ally for the patients to control the glycemic fluctuations and adjust their insulin therapy and dietary intakes, enabling them to speed up decision-making and improve personal self-management, resulting in a reduced risk of acute and chronic complications. As our last contribution, we assessed the validity of the approach by exploiting only blood glucose variations as well as in combination with the information of the insulin boluses, the skin temperature, and the galvanic skin response. In general, we have observed that providing other information but CGM leads to slightly lower performances with respect to considering CGM alone.

Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. 1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. 2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. 3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.

Screening to detect early sight-threatening lesions of DR can reduce the burden of vision loss; nevertheless, the process requires intensive manual labor and extensive resources to accommodate the increasing number of patients with diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be an effective tool which can potentially lower the burden of screening DR and vision loss. In this article, we review the use of AI for DR screening on color retinal photographs in different phases of application, ranging from development to deployment. Early studies of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms using feature extraction to detect DR achieved a high sensitivity but relatively lower specificity. Robust sensitivity and specificity were achieved with the application of deep learning (DL), although ML is still used in some tasks. Public datasets were utilized in retrospective validations of the developmental phases in most algorithms, which require a large number of photographs. Large prospective clinical validation studies led to the approval of DL for autonomous screening of DR although the semi-autonomous approach may be preferable in some real-world settings. There have been few reports on real-world implementations of DL for DR screening. It is possible that AI may improve some real-world indicators for eye care in DR, such as increased screening uptake and referral adherence, but this has not been proven. The challenges in deployment may include workflow issues, such as mydriasis to lower ungradable cases; technical issues, such as integration into electronic health record systems and integration into existing camera systems; ethical issues, such as data privacy and security; acceptance of personnel and patients; and health-economic issues, such as the need to conduct health economic evaluations of using AI in the context of the country.

This has led to increased interest in using RL to address complex issues in diabetes management. Using RL, a decision maker (or agent) observes decision-making factors (or state) from the dynamic operating environment, selects actions based on its optimal policy (i.e., a mapping between states and optimal actions), and subsequently receives delayed rewards. The agent adapts its policy to changes in the operating environment to maximize its cumulative reward as time goes by, thereby improving system performance. This paper presents how various variants of RL have been used to improve diabetes management, such as a higher time in range during which the blood glucose level is within the normal range and a higher similarity between RL and physician’s policies.

However, collaboratively training a DR staging model across multiple institutions remains a challenge due to non-iid data, client reliability, and confidence evaluation of the prediction. To address these issues, we propose a novel federated uncertainty-aware aggregation paradigm (FedUAA), which considers the reliability of each client and produces a confidence estimation for the DR staging. In our FedUAA, an aggregated encoder is shared by all clients for learning a global representation of fundus images, while a novel temperature-warmed uncertainty head (TWEU) is utilized for each client for local personalized staging criteria. Our TWEU employs an evidential deep layer to produce the uncertainty score with the DR staging results for client reliability evaluation. Furthermore, we developed a novel uncertainty-aware weighting module (UAW) to dynamically adjust the weights of model aggregation based on the uncertainty score distribution of each client. In our experiments, we collect five publicly available datasets from different institutions to conduct a dataset for federated DR staging to satisfy the real non-iid condition. The experimental results demonstrate that our FedUAA achieves better DR staging performance with higher reliability compared to other federated learning methods.

Effective management of blood glucose is essential for individuals with diabetes to mitigate these risks. This study introduces the Glu-Ensemble, a deep learning framework designed for precise blood glucose forecasting in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike other predictive models, Glu-Ensemble addresses challenges related to small sample sizes, data quality issues, reliance on strict statistical assumptions, and the complexity of models. It enhances prediction accuracy and model generalizability by utilizing larger datasets and reduces bias inherent in many predictive models. The framework's unified approach, as opposed to patient-specific models, eliminates the need for initial calibration time, facilitating immediate blood glucose predictions for new patients. The obtained results indicate that Glu-Ensemble surpasses traditional methods in accuracy, as measured by root mean square error, mean absolute error, and error grid analysis. The Glu-Ensemble framework emerges as a promising tool for blood glucose level prediction in type 2 diabetes patients, warranting further investigation in clinical settings for its practical application.

Utilizing the advancements in deep learning, computer-assisted diagnosis has emerged as a potent technique to examine medical images of patients’ eyes and detect damage to blood vessels. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of deep learning models has been impeded by factors such as imbalanced datasets, annotation inaccuracies, limited available images, and inadequate evaluation criteria. In this study, addressed these formidable challenges by employing three established benchmark datasets related to diabetic retinopathy. This approach has facilitated a comprehensive assessment of cutting-edge methodologies. As a result of our study, achieved remarkable precision scores: 93% for standard cases, 89% for mild instances, 81% for moderate conditions, 76% for severe stages, and 96% for diabetic retinopathy phases. Notably, conducted a thorough analysis of a hybrid model that integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model derivation. Our findings underscore the suitability of hybrid modeling strategies for detecting anomalies in blood vessels through the utilization of classification models.

There are currently multiple technologies for DR detection, some of which are already commercially available. To understand how these technologies work, we must know first some basic concepts about artificial intelligence (AI) such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML is the basic process by which AI incorporates new data using different algorithms and thus creates new knowledge on its base, learns from it, and makes determinations and predictions on some subject based on all that information. AI can be presented at various levels. DL is a specific type of ML, which trains a computer to perform tasks as humans do, such as speech recognition, image identification, or making predictions. DL has shown promising diagnostic performance in image recognition, being widely adopted in many domains, including medicine. For general image analysis, it has achieved strong results in various medical specialties such as radiology dermatology and in particular for ophthalmology. We will review how this technology is constantly evolving which are the available systems and their task in real world as well as the several challenges, such as medicolegal implications, ethics, and clinical deployment model needed to accelerate the translation of these new algorithms technologies into the global health-care environment.","Deep learning has shown promising diagnostic performance in image recognition, being widely adopted in many domains, including medicine as discussed by the authors and has achieved strong results in various medical specialties such as radiology dermatology and in particular for ophthalmology."

Deep learning models have provided leading results among machine learning algorithms to date in glucose prediction. However these models typically require large amounts of data to obtain best personalised glucose prediction results. Multitask learning facilitates an approach for leveraging data from multiple subjects while still learning accurate personalised models. In this work we present results comparing the effectiveness of multitask learning over sequential transfer learning, and learning only on subject-specific data with neural network and support vector regression. The multitask learning approach shows consistent leading performance in predictive metrics at both short-term and long-term prediction horizons. We obtain a predictive accuracy (RMSE) of 18.8 ±2.3, 25.3 ±2.9, 31.8 ±3.9, 41.2 ±4.5, 47.2 ±4.6 mg/dL at 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min prediction horizons respectively, with at least 93% clinically acceptable predictions using the Clarke Error Grid (EGA) at each prediction horizon. We also identify relevant prior information such as glycaemic variability that can be incorporated to improve predictive performance at long-term prediction horizons. Furthermore, we show consistent performance - ≤ 5% change in both RMSE and EGA (Zone A) - in rare cases of adverse glycaemic events with 1-6 weeks of training data. In conclusion, a multitask approach can allow for deploying personalised models even with significantly less subject-specific data without compromising performance.

Current blood glucose monitoring (BGM) methods are often invasive and require repetitive pricking of a finger to obtain blood samples, predisposing individuals to pain, discomfort, and infection. Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring (NIBGM) is ideal for minimizing discomfort, reducing the risk of infection, and increasing convenience.


OBJECTIVE
This review aimed to map the use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) in NIBGM.


METHODS
A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the Arksey O'Malley five-step framework. Eight electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane-Central Library, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) were searched from inception until February 8, 2023. Study selection was conducted by 2 independent reviewers, descriptive analysis was conducted, and findings were presented narratively. Study characteristics (author, country, type of publication, study design, population characteristics, mean age, types of noninvasive techniques used, and application, as well as characteristics of the BGM systems) were extracted independently and cross-checked by 2 investigators. Methodological quality appraisal was conducted using the Checklist for assessment of medical AI.


RESULTS
A total of 33 papers were included, representing studies from Asia, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa published between 2005 and 2023. Most studies used optical techniques (n=19, 58%) to estimate blood glucose levels (n=27, 82%). Others used electrochemical sensors (n=4), imaging (n=2), mixed techniques (n=2), and tissue impedance (n=1). Accuracy ranged from 35.56% to 94.23% and Clarke error grid (A+B) ranged from 86.91% to 100%. The most popular machine learning algorithm used was random forest (n=10) and the most popular deep learning model was the artificial neural network (n=6). The mean overall checklist for assessment of medical AI score on the included papers was 33.5 (SD 3.09), suggesting an average of medium quality. The studies reviewed demonstrate that some AI techniques can accurately predict glucose levels from noninvasive sources while enhancing comfort and ease of use for patients. However, the overall range of accuracy was wide due to the heterogeneity of models and input data.


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts are needed to standardize and regulate the use of AI technologies in BGM, as well as develop consensus guidelines and protocols to ensure the quality and safety of AI-assisted monitoring systems. The use of AI for NIBGM is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize diabetes management.","This scoping review maps AI applications in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, finding 33 studies with varying accuracy (35.56-94.23%) and quality, highlighting the need for standardization and regulation of AI technologies in BGM."

Michael D. Abràmoff","10.1109/TMI.2010.2089383","","Automated detection of lesions in retinal images is a crucial step towards efficient early detection, or screening, of large at-risk populations. In particular, the detection of microaneurysms, usually the first sign of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and the detection of drusen, the hallmark of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are of primary importance. In spite of substantial progress made, detection algorithms still produce 1) false positives - target lesions are mixed up with other normal or abnormal structures in the eye, and 2) false negatives - the large variability in the appearance of the lesions causes a subset of these target lesions to be missed. We propose a general framework for detecting and characterizing target lesions almost instantaneously. This framework relies on a feature space automatically derived from a set of reference image samples representing target lesions, including atypical target lesions, and those eye structures that are similar looking but are not target lesions. The reference image samples are obtained either from an expert- or a data-driven approach. Factor analysis is used to derive the filters generating this feature space from reference samples. Previously unseen image samples are then classified in this feature space. We tested this approach by training it to detect microaneurysms. On a set of images from 2739 patients including 67 with referable DR, DR detection area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was comparable (AUC=0.927) to our previously published red lesion detection algorithm (AUC=0.929). We also tested the approach on the detection of AMD, by training it to differentiate drusen from Stargardt's disease lesions, and achieved an AUC=0.850 on a set of 300 manually detected drusen and 300 manually detected flecks. The entire image processing sequence takes less than a second on a standard PC compared to minutes in our previous approach, allowing instantaneous detection. Free-response receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed the superiority of this approach over a framework where false positives and the atypical lesions are not explicitly modeled. A greater performance was achieved by the expert-driven approach for DR detection, where the designer had sound expert knowledge. However, for both problems, a comparable performance was obtained for both expert- and data-driven approaches. This indicates that annotation of a limited number of lesions suffices for building a detection system for any type of lesion in retinal images, if no expert-knowledge is available. We are studying whether the optimal filter framework also generalizes to the detection of any structure in other domains.","A general framework for detecting and characterizing target lesions almost instantaneously, which indicates that annotation of a limited number of lesions suffices for building a detection system for any type of lesion in retinal images, if no expert-knowledge is available."

In this paper, a novel red lesion detection method is presented based on a hybrid approach, combining prior works by Spencer et al. (1996) and Frame et al. (1998) with two important new contributions. The first contribution is a new red lesion candidate detection system based on pixel classification. Using this technique, vasculature and red lesions are separated from the background of the image. After removal of the connected vasculature the remaining objects are considered possible red lesions. Second, an extensive number of new features are added to those proposed by Spencer-Frame. The detected candidate objects are classified using all features and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. An extensive evaluation was performed on a test set composed of images representative of those normally found in a screening set. When determining whether an image contains red lesions the system achieves a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity of 87%. The method is compared with several different automatic systems and is shown to outperform them all. Performance is close to that of a human expert examining the images for the presence of red lesions.","A novel red lesion detection method is presented based on a hybrid approach, combining prior works by Spencer et al.

Results There was substantial agreement classifying ETDRS DR severity levels between MD and SF (kappa = 0.65, kappa(w) [linear weighted] = 0.87), MD and SD (kappa = 0.66, kappa(w) = 0.87), and SD and SF (kappa = 0.62, kappa(w) = 0.86) images.

The kappa agreement between MD and SF ranged from 0.80 to 0.94 for the presence or absence of eight ascending DR severity thresholds. Repeatability between the readers of the MD images was equal to or better than that of the readers of SD or SF images. Severity threshold grading repeatability between readers was similar with the MD and SF images. The kappa agreement between MD and SF for identifying diabetic retinopathy lesions ranged from moderate to almost perfect.

Design Analysis of the national database of blindness certificates of vision impairment (CVIs) received by the Certifications Office. Setting and participants Working age (16–64 years) population of England and Wales. Main outcome measures Number and cause of blindness certifications. Results The Certifications Office received 1756 CVIs for blindness from persons aged between 16 and 64 inclusive between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. The main causes of blindness certifications were hereditary retinal disorders (354 certifications comprising 20.2% of the total), diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (253 persons, 14.4%) and optic atrophy (248 persons, 14.1%). Together, these three leading causes accounted for almost 50% of all blindness certifications. Between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000, the leading causes of blindness certification were diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (17.7%), hereditary retinal disorders (15.8%) and optic atrophy (10.1%). Conclusions For the first time in at least five decades, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness among working age adults in England and Wales, having been overtaken by inherited retinal disorders. This change may be related to factors including the introduction of nationwide diabetic retinopathy screening programmes in England and Wales and improved glycaemic control.

Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cross-sectional study of DME grading based on monocular fundus photographs and OCT images obtained from patients with diabetic retinopathy at a single visit between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2014, at a university-based practice and analyzed between July 30, 2014, and May 29, 2015. Presence of DME, including clinically significant macular edema (CSME), on monocular fundus photographs used definitions from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Presence of DME on OCT used Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network eligibility criteria thresholds of CST for trials evaluating anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatments. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of DME based on monocular fundus photographs or OCT. Results A total of 246 eyes of 158 participants (mean [SD] age, 65.0 [11.9] years; 48.7% women; 60.8% white) were included. Among the 246 eyes, the prevalences of DME (61.4%) and CSME (48.5%) based on MESA definitions for monocular fundus photographs were greater than the DME prevalence based on OCT (21.1%) by 40.2% (95% CI, 32.8%-47.7%; P P Conclusions and Relevance These data suggest that many eyes diagnosed as having DME or CSME on monocular fundus photographs have no DME based on OCT CST, while many eyes diagnosed as not having DME or CSME on monocular fundus photographs have DME on OCT. While limited to 1 clinical practice, caution is suggested when extrapolating prevalence of eyes that may benefit from anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy based on epidemiologic surveys using photographs to diagnose DME.","These data suggest that many eyes diagnosed as having DME or CSME on monocular fundus photographs have no DME based on OCT CST, While limited to 1 clinical practice, caution is suggested when extrapolating prevalence of eyes that may benefit from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy based on epidemiologic surveys using photographs to diagnose DME."

Methods We used the previously reported consensus reference standard of referable DR (rDR), defined as International Clinical Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy moderate, severe nonproliferative (NPDR), proliferative DR, and/or macular edema (ME). Neither Messidor-2 images, nor the three retinal specialists setting the Messidor-2 reference standard were used for training IDx-DR version X2.1. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, area under the curve (AUC), and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Sensitivity was 96.8% (95% CI: 93.3%-98.8%), specificity was 87.0% (95% CI: 84.2%-89.4%), with 6/874 false negatives, resulting in a negative predictive value of 99.0% (95% CI: 97.8%-99.6%). No cases of severe NPDR, PDR, or ME were missed. The AUC was 0.980 (95% CI: 0.968-0.992). Sensitivity was not statistically different from published IDP sensitivity, which had a CI of 94.4% to 99.3%, but specificity was significantly better than the published IDP specificity CI of 55.7% to 63.0%. Conclusions A deep-learning enhanced algorithm for the automated detection of DR, achieves significantly better performance than a previously reported, otherwise essentially identical, algorithm that does not employ deep learning. Deep learning enhanced algorithms have the potential to improve the efficiency of DR screening, and thereby to prevent visual loss and blindness from this devastating disease.","A deep-learning enhanced algorithm for the automated detection of DR, achieves significantly better performance than a previously reported, otherwise essentially identical, algorithm that does not employ deep learning."

The majority of CNNs employed in retinal image diagnosis applications are image-based; wherein input is the retinal image and output is the classification/diagnosis, resulting in a blackbox like algorithm. In contrast, hybrid lesion-based algorithms employ multiple CNN-based detectors to categorically detect various lesions in the image, and final diagnosis is computed from combination of detector outputs. Such algorithms are more physiologically plausible and provides explainability of the final prediction through intermediate detector outputs. Both classes of algorithms have reported equal diagnostic performance and outperform clinical experts in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (rDR). However, CNNs are sensitive to adversarial images where a limited number of pixels are modified by a fraction of intensity while preserving global image context; leading to CNN misclassification. We compared diagnostic accuracy of the two classes of algorithms on adversarial images generated from rDR retinal images and results show that image-based CNNs are significantly more susceptible to adversarial images than hybrid lesion-based algorithms.","This work compared diagnostic accuracy of the two classes of algorithms on adversarial images generated from rDR retinal images and results show that image-based CNNs are significantly more susceptible to adversarialImages than hybrid lesion-based algorithms."

METHODS ETDRS protocol photographs and four variations of digital images (uncompressed stereoscopic, compressed stereoscopic, uncompressed monoscopic, and uncompressed monoscopic wide-angle mosaic) of 152 eyes were independently evaluated by using ETDRS classifications. Digital formats were compared to film and each other for agreement on severity level, DR presence at ascending threshold, presence of the DR index lesion, and repeatability of grading. Study parameters included image resolution sufficient to distinguish small lesions, color balancing of digital images to film, documenting essential ETDRS classification retinal regions, similar magnification, and supplementary green-channel viewing. RESULTS The κ statistic was substantial or near substantial between all digital formats and film for classifying severity levels (κ = 0.59-0.62; κ(w) [linear weighted] = 0.83-0.87). The distribution of DR levels in all digital formats was not significantly different from that of the film (Bhapkar test, P = 0.09-0.44). The κ among digital formats for severity level was also substantial or near substantial (κ = 0.58-0.76, κ(w) = 0.82-0.92). Differences between digital formats and film for grading severity level, severity threshold, or index lesions were not significant. The repeatability of grading between readers using film and all digital formats was also similar. CONCLUSIONS Digital format variations compared favorably with film for DR classification. Translating film characteristics (resolution, color/contrast) and protocol (magnification, retinal regions) to digital equivalents and augmentation of full color with green-channel viewing most likely contributed to the results.","Digital format variations compared favorably with film for DR classification, and Translating film characteristics and protocol to digital equivalents and augmentation of full color with green-channel viewing most likely contributed to the results."

Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation. Objective To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. Design and Setting A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency. Exposure Deep learning–trained algorithm. Main Outcomes and Measures The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity. Results The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%. Conclusions and Relevance In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.","An algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes."

Second, an extensive number of new features are added to those proposed by Spencer-Frame. The detected candidate objects are classified using all features and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. An extensive evaluation was performed on a test set composed of images representative of those normally found in a screening set. When determining whether an image contains red lesions the system achieves a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity of 87%.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— Four screening methods (an exam by an ophthalmologist through dilated pupils using direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, an exam by a physician9s assistant through dilated pupils using direct ophthalmoscopy, a single 45° retinal photograph without pharmacological dilation, and a set of three dilated 45° retinal photographs) were compared with a reference standard of stereoscopic 30° retinal photographs of seven standard fields read by a central reading center. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated after dichotomizing the retinopathy levels into none and mild nonproliferative versus moderate to severe nonproliferative and proliferative. Two sites were used. All patients with diabetes in a VA hospital outpatient clinic between June 1988 and May 1989 were asked to participate. Patients with diabetes identified from a laboratory list of elevated serum glucose values were recruited from a DOD medical center. RESULTS— The subjects (352) had complete exams excluding the exam by the physician9s assistant that was added later. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios are as follows: ophthalmologist 0.33, 0.99, 72, 0.67; photographs without pharmacological dilation 0.61, 0.85, 4.1, 0.46; dilated photographs 0.81, 0.97, 24, 0.19; and physician9s assistant 0.14, 0.99, 12, 0.87. CONCLUSIONS— Fundus photographs taken by the 45° camera through pharmacologically dilated pupils and read by trained readers perform as well as ophthalmologists for detecting diabetic retinopathy. Physician extenders can effectively perform the photography with minimal training but would require more training to perform adequate eye exams. In this older population, many patients did not obtain adequate nonpharmacological dilation for use of the 45° camera.","Fundus photographs taken by the 45° camera through pharmacologically dilated pupils and read by trained readers perform as well as ophthalmologists for detecting diabetic retinopathy."

If, however, all relevant lesions in an image can be detected by CAD algorithms, use of CAD for automatic reading or prescreening may become feasible. This work addresses the question how to fuse information from multiple CAD algorithms, operating on multiple images that comprise an exam, to determine a likelihood that the exam is normal and would not require further inspection by human operators. We focus on retinal image screening for diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. Current CAD systems are not designed to automatically evaluate complete exams consisting of multiple images for which several detection algorithm output sets are available. Information fusion will potentially play a crucial role in enabling the application of CAD technology to the automatic screening problem. Several different fusion methods are proposed and their effect on the performance of a complete comprehensive automatic diabetic retinopathy screening system is evaluated. Experiments show that the choice of fusion method can have a large impact on system performance. The complete system was evaluated on a set of 15 000 exams (60 000 images). The best performing fusion method obtained an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.881.

To examine how mydriasis and the medical qualifications of photographers who take retinal photographs influence the accuracy of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR).


METHODS
Our meta-analysis included studies that measured the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect any DR, sight-threatening DR, or macular edema. Using random-effects logistic regression, we examined the effect of variations in mydriatic status and in medical qualifications of photographers on sensitivity and specificity.


RESULTS
Only the category of ""any DR"" had sufficient consistency in definition, number of studies (n = 20), and number of assessments (n = 40) for meta-analysis. Variations in mydriatic status did not significantly influence sensitivity (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.41; P = .61) or specificity (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.57-1.54; P = .80). Variations in medical qualifications of photographers did not significantly influence sensitivity (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.31-5.12; P = .75). Specificity of detection of any DR was significantly higher for screening methods that use a photographer with specialist medical or eye qualifications (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.78-8.37; P = .001).


CONCLUSION
Outreach screening is an effective alternative to on-site specialist examination. It has potential to increase screening coverage of high-risk patients with DR in remote and resource-poor settings without the risk of missing DR and the opportunity to prevent vision loss. Our analysis was confined to the presence or absence of DR. Future studies should use consistent DR classification schemes to facilitate further analysis.",""

Digital retinal imaging is an established method of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). It has been established that currently about 1% of the world’s blind or visually impaired is due to DR. However, the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and DR is creating an increased workload on those with expertise in grading retinal images. Safe and reliable automated analysis of retinal images may support screening services worldwide. This study aimed to compare the Iowa Detection Program (IDP) ability to detect diabetic eye diseases (DED) to human grading carried out at Moorfields Reading Centre on the population of Nakuru Study from Kenya.


Participants 
Retinal images were taken from participants of the Nakuru Eye Disease Study in Kenya in 2007/08 (n = 4,381 participants [NW6 Topcon Digital Retinal Camera]).


Methods 
First, human grading was performed for the presence or absence of DR, and for those with DR this was sub-divided in to referable or non-referable DR. The automated IDP software was deployed to identify those with DR and also to categorize the severity of DR.


Main Outcome Measures 
The primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of IDP versus the human grader as reference standard.


Results 
Altogether 3,460 participants were included. 113 had DED, giving a prevalence of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.7–3.9%). Sensitivity of the IDP to detect DED as by the human grading was 91.0% (95% CI, 88.0–93.4%). The IDP ability to detect DED gave an AUC of 0.878 (95% CI 0.850–0.905). It showed a negative predictive value of 98%. The IDP missed no vision threatening retinopathy in any patients and none of the false negative cases met criteria for treatment.


Conclusions 
In this epidemiological sample, the IDP’s grading was comparable to that of human graders’. It therefore might be feasible to consider inclusion into usual epidemiological grading.","In this epidemiological sample, the Iowa Detection Program’s grading was comparable to that of human graders’, and it therefore might be feasible to consider inclusion into usual epidemiological grading."

The goal is to determine the required characteristics of the reference standard to assess and compare automated decision systems with a given degree of confidence, or, to determine what degree of confidence can be obtained given the characteristics of the reference standard. We modeled the expected value of the AUC that can be measured for a perfect decision system, given a reference standard provided either by a single human reader or by multiple human readers (consensus, majority vote). The proposed model was applied to diabetic retinopathy screening in a dataset of 874 eye fundus examinations graded by three readers. The expected value of the AUC for a perfect decision system was estimated at 0.956 against a single human reader, and 0.990 against a `majority wins' vote of three human readers. The Iowa detection program has reached the maximal performance measurable by a single human reader (0.929, CI: [0.897-0.962]) and is close to the maximal performance measurable by a `majority wins' vote (0.955, CI: [0.939-0.972]).","The expected value of the AUC that can be measured for a perfect decision system, given a reference standard provided either by a single human reader or by multiple human readers (consensus, majority vote) was modeled and applied to diabetic retinopathy screening."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —We reviewed the records of 244 patients with diabetes who had a dilated funduscopic examination (DFE) and NMDSRI done within 1 year of each other at four locations in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area. The images were transmitted through a local area network to a central reading location where they were graded by a single retinal specialist. RESULTS —Images of 482 eyes from 243 patients were included in the study. Four images did not transmit, and 35% of the images were not gradable. Of the remaining 311 eyes, there was 86% agreement in the grading between NMDSRI and DFE: 227 eyes with no diabetic retinopathy and 40 eyes with diabetic retinopathy. In 46 eyes (15%) there was a disagreement between gradings made by the two techniques. NMDSRI detected diabetic retinopathy in 35 eyes reported as normal by DFE, and in the remaining 11 eyes, the DFE grade was one grade higher than the NMDSRI grade. Adjudicated nonconcordant examinations were within one grade. In the 76 eyes with diabetic retinopathy, retinal thickness could not be assessed in 17 (21%) eyes. When the NMDSRI result was gradable, the overall sensitivity of NMDSRI was 98% and the specificity was 100% for retinopathy within one grade of the DFE. In the limited number of eyes that had diabetic retinopathy with macular edema (six), agreement with the clinical examination was 100%. CONCLUSIONS —NMDSRI is a sensitive and specific method for the screening and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, which may help improve compliance with the standards of eye care for patients with diabetes.","In this paper, the authors determined the sensitivity and specificity of nonmydriatic digital stereoscopic retinal imaging (NMDSRI) as a screening tool in detecting diabetic retinopathy."

Methods: Anonymous images from 5,386 patients screened in 2007 were obtained from a nonmydriatic diabetic retinopathy screening program in Portugal and graded by an experienced ophthalmologist. RetmarkerSR earmarked microaneurysms, generating two outputs: ‘disease’ or ‘no disease’. A second-step analysis, based on coregistration, combining two visits, was subsequently performed in 289 patients who underwent repeated examinations in 2008. The study was extended by analyzing all referrals considered urgent by the ophthalmologist from 2001 to 2007. Results were compared with those obtained by manual grading. Results: The RetmarkerSR classified in a first-step analysis 2,560 patients (47.5%) as having ‘no disease’ and 2,826 patients (52.5%) as having ‘disease’, thus requiring manual grading. RetmarkerSR detected all eyes considered urgent referrals. The two-step analysis further reduced the number of false-positive results by 26.3%, indicating an overall sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 63.2%. Conclusion: Automated grading of diabetic retinopathy may safely reduce the burden of grading patients in diabetic retinopathy screening programs.

Frequency distributions, measures of central tendency, and nonparametric statistics were employed to examine the traits of the sample and to make comparisons between type 1 and type 2 patients. Content analysis was used to describe and analyze the subjects' responses to the question, What is your greatest fear about having diabetes? Subjects' answers to this question were categorized and scored as representing fear of either a long-term or acute complication based on the clinical judgment of the authors. Results revealed that both type 1 and type 2 patients were likely to have given responses that were suggestive of fear of long-term complications. The major fears concerned amputation, cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and stroke. The findings of the present investigation suggest that diabetes educators may need to address patients' fears of long-term complications directly and effectively. Several areas of research that grew out of this exploratory study were recommended for future consideration.","The findings of the present investigation suggest that diabetes educators may need to address patients' fears of long-term complications directly and effectively."

A total of 1,676 patients in a primary care setting, with diabetes, without known diabetic retinopathy, and without previous screening by an ophthalmologist, were included between January 1 and December 31, 2003. Patients underwent a brief questionnaire and two field retinal photography. Photographs were independently read by two ophthalmologists. Outcome measures were gradability of the photographs, need for pharmacologic pupil dilation, assessment as suspect for presence of diabetic retinopathy, of neovascularization and of diabetic retinopathy, and agreement between graders. Of the population studied, 11.3% of patients required pupil dilation, average transmission time of images was 73 sec, 12.0% of patients had ungradable photographs, 10.4% of the patients with gradable photographs were assessed as ""suspect for diabetic retinopathy,"" and 2.0% were assessed to need urgent referral. Red lesions were present in 3.5% and bright lesions were present in 1.6% of all gradable patients. Neovascularization of the disk was found in one patient. Type 1 patients had much higher rates of ""suspect for diabetic retinopathy"" (34.5%) than type 2 patients (9.4%). Interrater agreement kappa was 0.93. Web-based screening, using open source technology and uncompressed images, is feasible in a primary care setting, with a high rate of inter-rater agreement. Dilate-as-needed may be a sensible approach for retinal photography. The high incidence of ""suspect for diabetic retinopathy"" in type 1 diabetes patients illustrates that web-based diabetic retinopathy screening programs for these patients may detect diabetic retinopathy that would otherwise have gone undetected.","Web-based screening, using open source technology and uncompressed images, is feasible in a primary care setting, with a high rate of inter-rater agreement, and Dilate-as-needed may be a sensible approach for retinal photography."

Methods Our meta-analysis included studies that measured the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect any DR, sight-threatening DR, or macular edema. Using random-effects logistic regression, we examined the effect of variations in mydriatic status and in medical qualifications of photographers on sensitivity and specificity. Results Only the category of ""any DR"" had sufficient consistency in definition, number of studies (n = 20), and number of assessments (n = 40) for meta-analysis. Variations in mydriatic status did not significantly influence sensitivity (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.41; P = .61) or specificity (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.57-1.54; P = .80). Variations in medical qualifications of photographers did not significantly influence sensitivity (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.31-5.12; P = .75). Specificity of detection of any DR was significantly higher for screening methods that use a photographer with specialist medical or eye qualifications (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.78-8.37; P = .001). Conclusion Outreach screening is an effective alternative to on-site specialist examination. It has potential to increase screening coverage of high-risk patients with DR in remote and resource-poor settings without the risk of missing DR and the opportunity to prevent vision loss. Our analysis was confined to the presence or absence of DR. Future studies should use consistent DR classification schemes to facilitate further analysis.","Outreach screening is an effective alternative to on-site specialist examination and has potential to increase screening coverage of high-risk patients with DR in remote and resource-poor settings without the risk of missing DR and the opportunity to prevent vision loss."

We conducted a review of the literature to select articles that performed a cost-benefit analysis for 17 widely practiced interventions for diabetes. A scale for categorizing interventions according to their economic impact was defined. The 17 interventions were classified as follows: 1) clearly cost-saving, 2) clearly cost-effective, 3) possibly cost-effective, 4) non-cost-effective, or 5) unclear. Clearly cost-saving interventions included eye care and pre-conception care. Clearly cost-effective interventions included nephropathy prevention in type 1 diabetes and improved glycemic control. Possibly cost-effective interventions included nephropathy prevention in type 2 diabetes and self-management training. Non-cost-effective interventions were not identified. Interventions with unclear economic impact included case management, medical nutrition therapy, self-monitoring of blood glucose, foot care, blood pressure control, blood lipid control, smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, HbA1c measurement, influenza vaccination, and pneumococcus vaccination. Widely practiced interventions for patients with diabetes can be clearly cost-saving and clearly cost-effective. These practices are attractive from both a medical and an economic perspective.","Widely practiced interventions for patients with diabetes can be clearly cost-saving and Clearly cost-effective, and these practices are attractive from both a medical and an economic perspective."
