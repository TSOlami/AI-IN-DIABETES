Diagnosing DR is inherently complex, as it necessitates the meticulous examination of intricate retinal images by experienced specialists. This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing. Remarkably, the DiaCNN model showcased unparalleled precision, achieving 100% accuracy in training and 98.3% in testing. These figures represent a significant leap in classification accuracy when juxtaposed with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Such advancements hold immense promise for the future, emphasizing the potential of our proposed technique to revolutionize the accuracy of DR and other eye disease diagnoses. By facilitating earlier detection and more timely interventions, this approach stands poised to significantly reduce the incidence of blindness associated with DR, thus heralding a new era of improved patient outcomes. Therefore, this work, through its novel approach and stellar results, not only pushes the boundaries of DR diagnostic accuracy but also promises a transformative impact in early detection and intervention, aiming to substantially diminish DR-induced blindness and champion enhanced patient care.

This disease is considered one of the principal causes of sightlessness and accounts for more than 158 million cases all over the world. Since early detection and classification could diminish the visual impairment, it is significant to develop an automated DR diagnosis method. Although deep learning models provide automatic feature extraction and classification, training such models from scratch requires a larger annotated dataset. The availability of annotated training datasets is considered a core issue for implementing deep learning in the classification of medical images. The models based on transfer learning are widely adopted by the researchers to overcome annotated data insufficiency problems and computational overhead. In the proposed study, features are extracted from fundus images using the pre-trained network VGGNet and combined with the concept of transfer learning to improve classification performance. To deal with data insufficiency and unbalancing problems, we employed various data augmentation operations differently on each grade of DR. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed framework (which is evaluated on the benchmark dataset) outperformed advanced methods in terms of accurateness. Our technique, in combination with handcrafted features, could be used to improve classification accuracy."

Many researchers have developed autonomous systems to recognize retinopathy via fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imagery. However, most of these frameworks employ conventional transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches, requiring a decent amount of well-annotated training data to produce accurate diagnostic performance. This paper presents a novel incremental cross-domain adaptation instrument that allows any deep classification model to progressively learn abnormal retinal pathologies in OCT and fundus imagery via few-shot training. Furthermore, unlike its competitors, the proposed instrument is driven via a Bayesian multi-objective function that not only enforces the candidate classification network to retain its prior learned knowledge during incremental training but also ensures that the network understands the structural and semantic relationships between previously learned pathologies and newly added disease categories to effectively recognize them at the inference stage. The proposed framework, evaluated on six public datasets acquired with three different scanners to screen thirteen retinal pathologies, outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors by achieving an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.9826 and 0.9846, respectively."

The early diagnosis of DR is crucial for its treatment. However, the diagnosis of DR is a very difficult process that requires an experienced ophthalmologist. A breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence called deep learning can help in giving the ophthalmologist a second opinion regarding the classification of the DR by using an autonomous classifier. To accurately train a deep learning model to classify DR, an enormous number of images is required, and this is an important limitation in the DR domain. Transfer learning is a technique that can help in overcoming the scarcity of images. The main idea that is exploited by transfer learning is that a deep learning architecture, previously trained on non-medical images, can be fine-tuned to suit the DR dataset. This paper reviews research papers that focus on DR classification by using transfer learning to present the best existing methods to address this problem. This review can help future researchers to find out existing transfer learning methods to address the DR classification task and to show their differences in terms of performance."

A large database of fundus photographs (n = 14,822) from a racially and ethnically diverse group of individuals (over 33% of African descent) was evaluated by expert reviewers and classified as GON or healthy. Several deep learning architectures and the impact of transfer learning were evaluated. The best performing model achieved an overall area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.91 in distinguishing GON eyes from healthy eyes. It also achieved an AUC of 0.97 for identifying GON eyes with moderate-to-severe functional loss and 0.89 for GON eyes with mild functional loss. A sensitivity of 88% at a set 95% specificity was achieved in detecting moderate-to-severe GON. In all cases, transfer improved performance and reduced training time. Model visualizations indicate that these deep learning models relied on, in part, anatomical features in the inferior and superior regions of the optic disc, areas commonly used by clinicians to diagnose GON. The results suggest that deep learning-based assessment of fundus images could be useful in clinical decision support systems and in the automation of large-scale glaucoma detection and screening programs."

Early detection and treatment of DR can salvage from visual impairment. The manual screening of DR is a very laborious and time-intensive effort and heavily dependent on professional ophthalmologists. In addition, the subtle distinction among various retinal biomarkers and different grades of DR makes this recognition very challenging. To address the aforementioned problem, deep neural networks have brought many revolutions in the last few years. In this study, we proposed a novel two-stage framework for automatic DR classification. In the first stage, we employed two distinct U-Net models for optic disc (OD) and blood vessel (BV) segmentation during the preprocessing. In the second stage, the enhanced retinal images after OD and BV extraction are used as an input of transfer learning-based model VGGNet, which performs DR detection by identifying retinal biomarkers such as microaneurysms (MA), haemorrhages (HM), and exudates (EX). The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 96.60%, 93.95%, 92.25% evaluated on EyePACS-1, Messidor-2, and DIARETDB0, respectively. Extensive experiments and comparison with baseline methods demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

The number of diabetic patients will increase to 552 million by 2034, as per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Aim With advances in computer science techniques, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), opportunities for the detection of DR at the early stages have increased. This increase means that the chances of recovery will increase and the possibility of vision loss in patients will be reduced in the future. Methods In this paper, deep transfer learning models for medical DR detection were investigated. The DL models were trained and tested over the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 dataset. According to literature surveys, this research is considered one the first studies to use of the APTOS 2019 dataset, as it was freshly published in the second quarter of 2019. The selected deep transfer models in this research were AlexNet, Res-Net18, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, and VGG19. These models were selected, as they consist of a small number of layers when compared to larger models, such as DenseNet and InceptionResNet. Data augmentation techniques were used to render the models more robust and to overcome the overfitting problem. Results The testing accuracy and performance metrics, such as the precision, recall, and F1 score, were calculated to prove the robustness of the selected models. The AlexNet model achieved the highest testing accuracy at 97.9%. In addition, the achieved performance metrics strengthened our achieved results. Moreover, AlexNet has a minimum number of layers, which decreases the training time and the computational complexity."

Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture VGG16 was employed for this study. A transfer learning process was implemented to re-train the CNN for robust OCTA classification. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of using this method for artificial intelligence (AI) screening of DR in clinical environments, the re-trained CNN was incorporated into a custom developed GUI platform which can be readily operated by ophthalmic personnel. Results: With last nine layers re-trained, CNN architecture achieved the best performance for automated OCTA classification. The overall accuracy of the re-trained classifier for differentiating healthy, NoDR, and NPDR was 87.27%, with 83.76% sensitivity and 90.82% specificity. The AUC metrics for binary classification of healthy, NoDR and DR were 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The GUI platform enabled easy validation of the method for AI screening of DR in a clinical environment. Conclusion: With a transfer leaning process to adopt the early layers for simple feature analysis and to re-train the upper layers for fine feature analysis, the CNN architecture VGG16 can be used for robust OCTA classification of healthy, NoDR, and NPDR eyes. Translational Relevance: OCTA can capture microvascular changes in early DR. A transfer learning process enables robust implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated OCTA classification of DR."

These features can be identified through computer vision techniques including deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) models. We aim to construct a DL model that can predict systemic features from fundus images and to determine the optimal method of model construction for this task. Data were collected from a cohort of patients undergoing diabetic retinopathy screening between March 2020 and March 2021. Two models were created for each of 12 systemic health features based on the DenseNet201 architecture: one utilizing transfer learning with images from ImageNet and another from 35,126 fundus images. Here, 1277 fundus images were used to train the AI models. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) scores were used to compare the model performance. Models utilizing the ImageNet transfer learning data were superior to those using retinal images for transfer learning (mean AUROC 0.78 vs. 0.65, p-value < 0.001). Models using ImageNet pretraining were able to predict systemic features including ethnicity (AUROC 0.93), age > 70 (AUROC 0.90), gender (AUROC 0.85), ACE inhibitor (AUROC 0.82), and ARB medication use (AUROC 0.78). We conclude that fundus images contain valuable information about the systemic characteristics of a patient. To optimize DL model performance, we recommend that even domain specific models consider using transfer learning from more generalized image sets to improve accuracy."

If an early prognostication of DR is not done, then it may lead to loss of vision. Some of the diagnosing tools for detection of DR are Indirect Ophthalmoscope, Slit Lamp Examination, Color Photograph, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The DR dataset contains 5 types of lesions ranging from mild to severe. These lesions are hard to distinguish from each other. The manual diagnosis of DR involves the proper classification of these lesions into their appropriate classes that is quite tedious and error-prone process marred with low level of accuracies. Researchers therefore rely on automatic detection and prognosis of DR based on Machine Learning (ML) methods. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) framework to classify these lesions with high level of accuracy. To accomplish the task, we train a DL model Visual Geometry Group (VGG19) on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) dataset to extract the features from the color fundus eye photography provided in the dataset. The extracted features are then fed into different classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) etc. to classify the lesions properly. We thus show, that using DL along with Transfer Learning (TL) can classify the affected areas such as Microaneurysms (MA), Soft Exudates (SE), Hard Exudates (EX), and Hemorrhage (HE) of a DR eye with high accuracy."

One of the main characteristics of PDR is the development of neovascularization, a condition in which abnormal blood vessels are formed on the retina. This condition can cause blindness if it is not detected and treated early. Numerous studies have proposed different image processing techniques for detecting neovascularization in fundus images. However, because of its random growth pattern and small size, neovascularization remains challenging to detect. Hence, deep learning techniques are becoming more prevalent in neovascularization identification because of their ability to perform automatic feature extraction on objects with complex features. In this paper, a method of neovascularization detection based on transfer learning is proposed. The performance of the transfer learning method is investigated using four pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which include AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet18, and ResNet50. In addition, an improved network based on the combination of ResNet18 and GoogLeNet is proposed. Evaluation on 1174 retinal image patches showed that the proposed network could achieve 91.57%, 85.69%, 97.44%, and 97.10% of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, respectively. We demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms each individual CNN for neovascularization detection. It also shows better performance compared to another method that utilized deep learning models for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification."

However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even when the domains or the tasks are entirely different. In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Catech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled data collected from distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\% classification accuracy, which is 13\% higher classification accuracy than ""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8\% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms."

These algorithms have shown high sensitivity and specificity for detecting DR in non-clinical setup. Transfer learning has been successfully tested in many medical imaging applications like skin cancer detection, pulmonary nodule detection, Alzheimer’s disease etc. This paper experiments with the different DL architectures such as VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, MobileNet and NASNet for automated DR classification (binary and multi class) on Messidor dataset. The dataset is publicly available, and comprises of 1200 retinal fundus images. The images belong to four different classes of DR namely, normal (class 0), mild (class 1), moderate (class 2) and severe (class 3), graded based on the severity level of DR. In our experiment, we have enhanced the quality of input images by applying algorithms like CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation) algorithm and Powerlaw transformation as pre-processing techniques, which work on the small image patches with high accuracy, contrast limiting and image sharpening. Hyper parameter tuning on pretrained InceptionV3 architecture, resulted in enhancing the accuracy of the model. Both binary and multi class results were analysed considering inter class (one class with another class) accuracies. We achieved an accuracy of 78% between class 0 and class 1, the accuracy between class 0 and class 2 further reduced to 69%, while class 1 and class 2 showed an accuracy of 61%. Moreover, the interclass class accuracy between class 1 and class 3 was 62%, class 2 and class 3 further reduced to 49%. The accuracy further diminished between class 0 and class 3 to 32%. These experiments suggest that the pretrained models provided better results in classifying normal and mild, but they were not that much efficient in classifying moderate-severe and normal-severe binary classifications."
