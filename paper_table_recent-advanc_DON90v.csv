"The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Health Outcomes: A Review","https://scispace.com/paper/the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-health-outcomes-a-2ujc8osfiyyq","2024","Journal Article","","Syed Shah","10.70389/pjs.100006","","Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, creating more tailored treatments, and streamlining healthcare administration. Focusing on peer-reviewed articles published in the past decade, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken using PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore. Some important results include the fact that AI can diagnose diseases and disorders as accurately as human specialists can, including skin cancer and diabetic retinopathy. For Instance, AI was able to detect diabetic retinopathy with a sensitivity rate of 97.5% and skin cancer with an accuracy rate of 72.1%. There was a 93% agreement between expert oncologists and AI-driven IBM Watson for Oncology recommendations for treatment optimization. Hospital readmissions for chronic diseases decreased by 22% when wearables powered by AI were used. The area under consideration (AUC-ROC) for AI models in healthcare management to forecast in-hospital mortality was 0.86. Despite these advantages, there are still problems that need to be resolved, including issues with data privacy and ethics, regulatory changes, and integration. That AI systems are open, equitable, and responsible is of the utmost importance. The key to a successful adoption is overcoming healthcare professionals’ resistance through proper training. These are the areas where future AI research should focus for the technology to fulfil its healthcare potential. ","This review synthesizes peer-reviewed literature on AI's impact on healthcare, highlighting its potential to enhance diagnostics, treatments, and administration, with notable successes in disease diagnosis and hospital readmission reduction, but emphasizing the need for addressing data privacy and ethics concerns."

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of AI-DSS in real world diabetes clinics.
 Methods: Data was collected and evaluated from routine AI-DSS usage for individuals with type 1 diabetes treated at 21 diabetes clinics (in the USA and 2 in Israel) . Two analyses were made: (1) Insulin dose recommendations were compared for rate of agreement/disagreement between those suggested by the AI-DSS and the approved recommendations by health care providers (HCP) . (2) Glycemic outcomes were compared between baseline and after 3 months of AI-DSS use. Included in this analysis were individuals who had mean baseline glucose level ≥ 182 mg/dL and at least one AI-DSS recommendation within the 3-months.
 Results: A total of 8 recommendations, provided to 370 individuals, were evaluated. Full agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments was observed in 87%, 87%, and 83% of the basal rate, carbs ratio (CR) , and correction factor (CF) pump settings parameters, respectively. Full disagreement on the direction of dose change was observed in only 0.9%, 0.5%, and 1.2% for the basal rate, CR and CF, respectively. Glycemic outcome analysis included 1 eligible individuals (mean of 1.6 recommendations within a 3-month interval) . Average sensor percentage of time in range [70-180 mg/dL] increased by 4% (p=0.003) : 43% increased time in range by more than 5% and 33% increased by 10% or more. Time in hyperglycemia [> 180 mg/dL] was reduced by 5% (p<0.01) while time in severe hypoglycemia [< 54 mg/dL] remained below 0.5%.
 Conclusion: A high rate of agreement with automated insulin adjustments was observed among HCPs at academic centers who used the AI-DSS in their workflow. Glycemic control was significantly improved for sub-optimally controlled individuals already after 3-months of follow up.

Basir","10.1089/15209150050501989","","Maintaining optimal blood glucose (BG) control is difficult for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients when typical daily regimens of food, insulin and exercise are altered. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems consisting of treatment algorithms calibrated through large datasets of patient specific information may offer a solution. Such a system can predict BG level changes resulting from regimen disturbances and recommend regimen changes for compensation. A software prototype based on neural network, fuzzy logic, and expert system concepts was developed and evaluated to determine feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific prediction model. BG data are the primary driver for adapting existing functions to patient specific prediction algorithms. Mean absolute percent error (MAPE) between actual and predicted BG values from inputs of daily insulin, food, and exercise information for an T1DM test subject was 10.5% using a calibrated model. The prototype is limited by the requirement for a rigid testing schedule, human error and situational circumstances such as alcohol consumption, illness, infection, stress, and significant hormonal imbalances. No significant conclusions regarding model validity can be drawn due to limited evaluation process and subject sample size, although the prototype has demonstrated viability as a learning tool for diabetes patients. Increased impetus for further development of this prototype and similar AI models may materialize when more effective diagnostic and data capture tools become available to reduce testing and improve accuracy of the model with more input data.","A software prototype based on neural network, fuzzy logic, and expert system concepts was developed and evaluated to determine feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific prediction model and has demonstrated viability as a learning tool for diabetes patients."

Pengfei Zhou","10.48550/arxiv.2411.12812","","People with diabetes need insulin delivery to effectively manage their blood glucose levels, especially after meals, because their bodies either do not produce enough insulin or cannot fully utilize it. Accurate insulin delivery starts with estimating the nutrients in meals and is followed by developing a detailed, personalized insulin injection strategy. These tasks are particularly challenging in daily life, especially without professional guidance. Existing solutions usually assume the prior knowledge of nutrients in meals and primarily rely on feedback from professional clinicians or simulators to develop Reinforcement Learning-based models for insulin management, leading to extensive consumption of medical resources and difficulties in adapting the models to new patients due to individual differences. In this paper, we propose DIETS, a novel diabetic insulin management framework built on the transformer architecture, to help people with diabetes effectively manage insulin delivery in everyday life. Specifically, DIETS tailors a Large Language Model (LLM) to estimate the nutrients in meals and employs a titration model to generate recommended insulin injection strategies, which are further validated by a glucose prediction model to prevent potential risks of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. DIETS has been extensively evaluated on three public datasets, and the results show it achieves superior performance in providing effective insulin delivery recommendation to control blood glucose levels.","This paper proposes DIETS, a novel diabetic insulin management framework using transformer architecture, to estimate meal nutrients and generate personalized insulin injection strategies, achieving superior performance in controlling blood glucose levels."

Genomic information is used to discover heritable risk factors or features applied in precision medicine to guide treatment decisions. This information is fixed in time for any individual. By contrast, periodically updated medical records and especially the use of real-time health-sensing devices provide accurate tracking of health and disease over time. The technological trend toward enabling consumer electronics with capabilities for sensing physiological signals, such as motion, heart rate, or blood sugar levels, is creating a vast data space. If properly processed, these real-time data can fundamentally change research paradigms and transform the clinical practice.However, more data are not always better. With the increased data volume and complexity, the challenge becomes how to extract information relevant to the condition of a particular patient at a particular time. The classic pathway of medical logic of data → information → decision becomes difficult to follow with the traditional methods of biostatistics. New approaches are needed and are fortunately available, ranging from modeling, simulation, and optimal control methods, to rapidly developing data science tools.Before continuing further, we should emphasize that, arguably, diabetes mellitus is the best quantified human condition. In the past 40 years, metabolic monitoring technologies have progressed from occasional assessment of average glycemia via glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), to blood glucose monitoring a few times a day, to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) producing data points every few minutes—time series tracking the dynamics of the metabolic system. The high temporal resolution of CGM data has enabled advanced treatments such as decision support assisting insulin injection or oral medication, or automated closed-loop control known as the ""artificial pancreas."" Sophisticated metabolic models and simulators are available as well.In this article, we review the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We structured the results of this review in three sections: (1) closed-loop control, or automated insulin delivery (AID), which appears to be the term preferred recently; (2) decision-support systems (DSS), particularly those that use contemporary methods such as artificial intelligence, and (3) data acquisition, engineering, analytics, and visualization, which are all data science tools increasingly applied to the retrieval of electronic medical records (EMR) and real-time disease-tracking information.Key Articles ReviewedConsensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M, Nimri R, Bergenstal RM, Barnard-Kelly K, Danne T, Hovorka R, Kovatchev BP, Messer LH, Parkin CG, Ambler-Osborn L, Amiel SA, Bally L, Beck RW, Biester S, Biester T, Blanchette JE, Bosi E, Boughton CK, Breton MD, Brown SA, Buckingham BA, Cai A, Carlson AL, Castle JR, Choudhary P, Close KL, Cobelli C, Criego AB, Davis E, de Beaufort C, de Bock MI, DeSalvo DJ, DeVries JH, Dovc K, Doyle FJ 3rd, Ekhlaspour L, Shvalb NF, Forlenza GP, Gallen G, Garg SK, Gershenoff DC, Gonder-Frederick LA, Haidar A, Hartnell S, Heinemann L, Heller S, Hirsch IB, Hood KK, Isaacs D, Klonoff DC, Kordonouri O, Kowalski A, Laffel L, Lawton J, Lal RA, Leelarathna L, Maahs DM, Murphy HR, Nørgaard K, O'Neal D, Oser S, Oser T, Renard E, Riddell MC, Rodbard D, Russell SJ, Schatz DA, Shah VN, Sherr JL, Simonson GD, Wadwa RP, Ward C, Weinzimer SA, Wilmot EG, Battelino TEndoc Rev2023;

8:e47592Closed-Loop Control of Diabetes, or AIDA PubMed search on artificial pancreas, or AID, or closed loop in diabetes identified 397 results for the period of July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. From these, we selected 40 articles of interest (e.g., ∼10%) for inclusion in the reference list of this article. Five of these articles are reviewed in more detail in the following pages (1–5). It is worth noting that four of them are published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (impact factor, 176.082) (2–5) and signify substantial clinical trials by different research groups. Publication of these studies in such high-ranking journals was rare until recently, and we believe the AID literature this past year has achieved a new record in terms of its impact on medical science.A number of other notable studies were published as well (6–15) that tested various AID systems in diverse conditions, such as the inpatient setting (7), with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (9,10), with long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D) with hypoglycemia unawareness (12), or in very young children (14). The large randomized trials (> 100 participants) used traditional designs to reconfirm the advantages of hybrid closed loop over conventional therapy (6,15). Meta-analyses (16–18) and comprehensive reviews (19–23) solidified AID as an advanced, effective, and cost-effective (24) treatment of T1D and T2D. International consortiums published clinical guidelines for the use of AID in the clinical practice (1,25–27). And several studies reported real-life data for various AID systems (28–35), with one study reporting data for nearly 20,000 AID users (28).The investigation of using ultra-rapid-acting insulin has continued with clinical trials comparing faster insulin aspart with standard insulin aspart (36–38) and yielding mixed results—in some studies no effect was shown (36), in others ultra-rapid insulin contributed to better control (38). A new study using a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor in addition to insulin in people with T1D confirmed previous results and found that ""empagliflozin at 2.5 and 5 mg increased time in range during hybrid closed-loop therapy by 11–13 percentage points compared with placebo in those who otherwise were unable to attain glycemic targets"" (39). And last, but not least, a study on AID performance during swimming was published, which also presents interesting data about the interdevice (sensor–pump) communication in water (40).Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M1,2*, Nimri R1,2*, Bergenstal RM3, Barnard-Kelly K4, Danne T5, Hovorka R6, Kovatchev BP7, Messer LH8, Parkin CG9, Ambler-Osborn L10, Amiel SA11, Bally L12, Beck RW13, Biester S5, Biester T5, Blanchette JE14,15, Bosi E16, Boughton CK17, Breton MD7, Brown SA7,18, Buckingham BA19, Cai A20, Carlson AL3, Castle JR21, Choudhary P22, Close KL20, Cobelli C23, Criego AB3, Davis E24, de Beaufort C25, de Bock MI26, DeSalvo DJ27, DeVries JH28, Dovc K29, Doyle FJ 3rd30, Ekhlaspour L31, Shvalb NF1, Forlenza GP8, Gallen G11, Garg SK8, Gershenoff DC3, Gonder-Frederick LA7, Haidar A32, Hartnell S33, Heinemann L34, Heller S35, Hirsch IB36, Hood KK37, Isaacs D38, Klonoff DC39, Kordonouri O5, Kowalski A40, Laffel L10, Lawton J41, Lal RA42, Leelarathna L43, Maahs DM19, Murphy HR44, Nørgaard K45, O'Neal D46, Oser S47, Oser T47, Renard E48, Riddell MC49, Rodbard D50, Russell SJ51, Schatz DA52, Shah VN8, Sherr JL53, Simonson GD3, Wadwa RP8, Ward C54, Weinzimer SA53, Wilmot EG55,56, Battelino T29*Contributed equally to the manuscript and are both corresponding authors 1The Jesse Z and Sara Lea Shafer Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center for Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel; 2Sacker Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; 3International Diabetes Center, HealthPartners Institute, Minneapolis, MN; 4Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK; 5AUF DER BULT, Diabetes-Center for Children and Adolescents, Endocrinology and General Paediatrics, Hannover, Germany; 6Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; 7Center for Diabetes Technology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 8Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver—Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 9CGParkin Communications, Inc., Henderson, NV; 10Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; 11Department of Diabetes, King's College London, London, UK; 12Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 13Jaeb Center for Health Research Foundation, Inc., Tampa, FL; 14College of Nursing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; 15Center for Diabetes and Obesity, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; 16Diabetes Research Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital and San Raffaele Vita Salute University, Milan, Italy; 17Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Cambridge, UK; 18Division of Endocrinology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 19Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 20The diaTribe Foundation/Close Concerns, San Diego, CA; 21Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; 22Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; 23Department of Woman and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; 24Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Australia; 25Diabetes & Endocrine Care Clinique Pédiatrique DECCP/Centre Hospitalier Luxembourg, and Faculty of Sciences, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzette, GD Luxembourg/Department of Paediatrics, UZ-VUB, Brussels, Belgium; 26Department of Paediatrics, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand; 27Division of Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX ; 28Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Internal Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 29Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, UMC - University Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; 30Harvard John A.

Numerous randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have shown that the use of AID systems is safe and effective in helping individuals with diabetes achieve long-term glycemic goals while reducing hypoglycemia risk. AID systems have thus become an integral part of diabetes management, but recommendations for using AID systems in clinical settings have been lacking.MethodsIn 2021, an international panel of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in AID was organized by the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress to develop clinical guidelines for initiating AID for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The nine working groups addressed evolution of AID, clinical evidence, determining the target population for AID use, initiation of AID, education and training, utilization of AID, AID data reporting, psychological issues/user perspective, and the future of AID. The full panel voted on the working group recommendations, which became the basis of the consensus recommendations.ResultsThe report provides needed guidance to clinicians who are interested in using AID and (2) serves as a comprehensive review of evidence for payers to consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage.ConclusionsGuided recommendations are critical for AID success and acceptance, and all clinicians who treat diabetes need to become familiar with the available systems to eliminate disparities in diabetes quality of care. A comprehensive listing of the evidence payers should consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage is also provided.CommentsThese consensus recommendations published in Endocrine Reviews present the collective opinion of a select group of experts in AID (aka closed-loop control of diabetes) regarding the use of AID systems in clinical practice. This article is a highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to be introduced to the current technological and clinical state of AID systems, with a peek into their future as well.Following a review of the closed-loop field and an account of the evidence-based advantages of AID systems over other T1D therapies, the guidelines continue with sections explaining the different types of AID algorithms and the difference between hybrid and fully automated AID systems (HCL and FCL), the latter being defined as an AID system that does not require user involvement to function.The following are major takeaways from these consensus recommendations. (1) Evidence suggests that AID systems should be considered as a treatment option for all people with T1D to improve glycemic control, regardless of age, hypoglycemia awareness, pregnancy, or certain comorbidities. (2) To date, all clinically available systems are ""hybrid,"" meaning they require specific diabetes managements skills such as carbohydrate counting, so training and support for users and health-care providers are essential. (3) Interoperability between system components (e.g., sensors, algorithms, and insulin pumps) is important for the proliferation of these new technologies, but to a large extent this depends on the industry. (4) Early initiation of diabetes technologies in newly diagnosed T1D has been shown to improve and sustain long-term glycemic control, so early AID system initiation is encouraged. (5) The transition to an AID system should be individualized, and the initial settings of an AID system should be selected according to personal glycemic targets, based on recently acquired continuous glucose monitor (CGM) metrics. (6) Unified reporting of AID data is suggested, using clinically important glucose (e.g., time-in-range) and insulin (e.g., total daily insulin) metrics, plus the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) usually aggregated over 14 days, which has become a standardized way to visualize CGM data. (7) Psychological issues related to the use of AID systems should be discussed and documented in the context of discontinuation or noncompliance with AID treatment.In conclusion, the consensus recommendations map future directions for AID development, including FCL, use of data science methods to analyze and comprehend the vast amounts of CGM and insulin-delivery data collected by AID systems, and learning adaptive AID algorithms that continually tailor the treatment to the changing behavior and physiology of their users. The consensus strongly recommends that all payers (government and private) should reimburse for AID systems as well as for AID education and training to support the management of people with T1D.Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery in Type 1 DiabetesBurnside MJ1,3, Lewis DM11, Crocket HR4, Meier RA1, Williman JA2, Sanders OJ1,3, Jefferies CA6,7, Faherty AM6, Paul RG5, Lever CS5, Price SKJ5, Frewen CM8, Jones SD8, Gunn TC10, Lampey C6, Wheeler BJ8,9, de Bock MI1,31Departments of Pediatrics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 2Department of Population Health, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 3Department of Pediatrics, Canterbury District Health Board Christchurch, New Zealand; 4Te Huataki Waiora School of Health, Sport and Human Performance, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; 5Waikato Regional Diabetes Service, Waikato District Health Board, Hamilton, New Zealand; 6Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Starship Children's Health, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 7Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 8Department of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 9Pediatric Department, Southern District Health Board, Dunedin, New Zealand; 10Nightscout New Zealand, Hamilton, New Zealand; 11OpenAPS, Seattle, WAN Engl J Med 2022;387:869–881This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) use open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, and more data are needed on the efficacy and safety of these system.MethodsIn this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, patients with T1D were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use an open-source AID system or a sensor-augmented insulin pump (control). The participants included both children (defined as 7–15 years of age) and adults (defined as 16–70 years of age). A modified version of AndroidAPS 2.8 (with a standard OpenAPS 0.7.0 algorithm) paired with a preproduction DANA-i insulin pump and Dexcom G6 CGM, which has an Android smartphone application as the user interface, was used as the AID system. The primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) between days 155 and 168, the final 2 weeks of the trial.ResultsA total of 97 patients (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization, 44 to open-source AID and 53 to the control group. At 24 weeks, the mean time in the target range increased from 61.2% ± 12.3% SD to 71.2% ± 12.1% SD in the AID group and decreased from 57.7% ± 14.3% SD to 54.5% ± 16.0% SD in the control group (adjusted difference, 14 percentage points [95% CI, 9.2–18.8], P < 0.001), with no treatment effect according to age (P = 0.56). Participants in the AID group spent 3 hours and 21 minutes more in the target range per day compared with in the control group. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in either group. Two patients in the AID group withdrew from the trial owing to connectivity issues.ConclusionsThe use of an open-source AID system in children and adults with T1D resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time in the target glucose range compared with the use of a sensor-augmented insulin pump.CommentsOpen-source AID (or Do-it-yourself Loop) algorithms have been available since before commercial AID systems appeared on the market. Typically, the handling of these open-source algorithms required above-average engineering and computer skills. The lack of clinical trials of open-source AID was also a reason these systems to remain unregulated (i.e., not formally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] or other regulatory agencies). This article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine aims to counter these shortcomings by presenting a randomized-controlled trial of one open-source algorithm running on a smartphone.The trial achieved results that are very similar to those in trials published to date for commercial AID systems: for instance, a 14-percentage-point increase in time in range up to 71%, a reduction of HbA1c of 0.5 percentage points, and a relatively low risk for hypoglycemia. The editorial that accompanied the article labeled the trial a ""path toward expanding treatment options for diabetes"" (41). As expected there were opposing opinions that emphasized the lack of regulatory approval of open-source AID: ""Unapproved products and algorithms raise the undesirable prospect of clinical harm and litigation"" (42). After the publication of this article, the latter argument became less critical owing to the FDA approval in January 2023 of Tidepool Loop—an FDA-regulated version of Loop, to be available in the iOS App Store, which is intended to work with commercially available insulin pumps and CGMs.This ATTD Yearbook article takes a neutral view on the open-source AID controversy: evidence has shown that these systems are not superior to commercial devices, and their more flexible customization features do not necessarily result in improved glycemic control. However, as noted in the previously mentioned editorial (41), open-source AID offers one more path toward expanding the treatment options for insulin-requiring diabetes, which can be appealing to a perhaps select group of people who are confident in their diabetes-management skills.Trial of Hybrid Closed-Loop Control in Young Children with Type 1 DiabetesWadwa RP1, Reed ZW2, Buckingham BA3, DeBoer MD5, Ekhlaspour L4, Forlenza GP1, Schoelwer M5, Lum J2, Kollman C2, Beck RW2, Breton MD5, for the PEDAP Trial Study Group1Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 2Jaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, FL; 3Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 4Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University of California, San Francisco, CA; 5University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology, Charlottesville, VAN Engl J Med 2023;388:991–1001This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.Closed-loop control systems of insulin delivery may improve glycemic outcomes in young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the efficacy and safety of initiating a closed-loop s ","This article reviews the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 2022 to June 2023, focusing on closed-loop control, artificial intelligence-based decision-support systems, and data science.

The method employs a closed-loop system consisting of a blood glucose (BG) metabolic model and a multi-agent soft actor-critic RL model acting as the basal-bolus advisor. Performance evaluation is conducted in three scenarios, comparing the RL agents to conventional therapy. Evaluation metrics include glucose levels (minimum, maximum, and mean), time spent in different BG ranges, and average daily bolus and basal insulin dosages. Results demonstrate that the RL-based basal-bolus advisor significantly improves glucose control, reducing glycemic variability and increasing time spent within the target range (70-180 mg/dL). Hypoglycemia events are effectively prevented, and severe hyperglycemia events are reduced. The RL approach also leads to a statistically significant reduction in average daily basal insulin dosage compared to conventional therapy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the multi-agent RL approach in achieving better glucose control and mitigating the risk of severe hyperglycemia in individuals with T1D.

However, AI has evolved with the introduction of transformer models, allowing analysis of the diverse, multimodal data sources existing in medicine today. Multimodal AI holds great promise in more accurate disease risk assessment and stratification as well as optimizing the key driving factors in cardiometabolic disease: blood pressure, sleep, stress, glucose control, weight, nutrition, and physical activity. In this article we outline the current state of medical AI in cardiometabolic disease, highlighting the potential of multimodal AI to augment personalized prevention and treatment strategies in cardiometabolic disease. ","This article explores the application of multimodal AI in cardiometabolic disease prevention and management, leveraging diverse data sources to improve disease risk assessment, stratification, and personalized treatment strategies."

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.","This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field."

Several factors influence the subject’s BG profile over the day, including meals, physical activity, and sleep. Wearable devices are available for monitoring the patient’s BG value around the clock, while activity trackers can be used to record his/her sleep and physical activity. However, few tools are available to jointly analyze the collected data, and only a minority of them provide functionalities for performing advanced and personalized analyses. In this paper, we present AID-GM, a web application that enables the patient to share with his/her diabetologist both the raw BG data collected by a flash glucose monitoring device, and the information collected by activity trackers, including physical activity, heart rate, and sleep. AID-GM provides several data views for summarizing the subject’s metabolic control over time, and for complementing the BG profile with the information given by the activity tracker. AID-GM also allows the identification of complex temporal patterns in the collected heterogeneous data. In this paper, we also present the results of a real-world pilot study aimed to assess the usability of the proposed system. The study involved 30 pediatric patients receiving care at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, Italy.","A web application that enables the patient to share with his/her diabetologist both the raw BG data collected by a flash glucose monitoring device, and the information collected by activity trackers, including physical activity, heart rate, and sleep, is presented."
