We introduce a novel approach to DR detection using transfer learning, leveraging a single fundus photograph to automatically identify the disease&amp;rsquo;s stage. DR progresses through four stages, posing challenges for early detection, with existing methods often inefficient and prone to disagreements among clinicians. The proposed approach demonstrated in the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Competition employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achieved a high quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.92546, highlighting its effectiveness in automatic DR detection and emphasizing the need for timely intervention. This paper first reviews related work, spanning classical computer vision methods to deep learning approaches, with a focus on CNNs. Transfer learning with CNN architectures is explored, showcasing promising results from various studies. Identifying two critical gaps in existing literature, the research emphasizes the need for comprehensive exploration into integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with segmented image inputs for generating test/treatment recommendations. In addition, understanding the dynamic interactions among integrated components, including lesion segmentations, disease classification, and LLMs within web applications, remains essential. The objectives of the study include developing a comprehensive DR detection methodology, exploring and implementing model integration, evaluating performance through competition ranking, contributing significantly to DR detection methodologies, and identifying research gaps. The study encompasses revolutionizing DR detection by integrating cutting-edge technologies, focusing on transfer learning and various model integrations within web applications. The methodology covers data pre-processing, augmentation, segmentation using U-Net neural network architecture, and a detailed training process. The U-Net model demonstrates efficient segmentation of retinal structures with high accuracy and an impressive frames-per-second rate. The results highlight the model&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness in segmenting blood vessels, hard exudates, soft exudates, hemorrhages, microaneurysms, and the optical disc, with high Jaccard, F1, recall, precision, and accuracy scores. These findings underscore the model&amp;rsquo;s potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities in retinal pathology assessment, promising improved patient outcomes through timely diagnosis and intervention in combating DR.

We tackle the problem caused by the quality of fundus photographs that are commonly found in clinical settings, which frequently display noise and abnormalities. Our methodology consists of pretraining the EfficientNetB0 model on a sizable dataset of excellent fundus photos, followed by fine-tuning it on a dataset of poor fundus photos.

Developing robust AI models for DR classification holds substantial potential, but a key challenge is ensuring their generalization in unfamiliar domains with varying data distributions. To address this, our paper investigates cross-domain generalization, also known as domain generalization (DG), within the context of DR classification. DG, a challenging problem in the medical domain, is complicated by the difficulty of gathering labeled data across different domains, such as patient demographics and disease stages. Some recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using CLIP to handle the DG problem in natural images. In this study, we investigate CLIP's transfer learning capabilities and its potential for cross-domain generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We carry out comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy and potential of CLIP in addressing DG for DR classification. Further, we introduce a multi-modal fine-tuning strategy named Context Optimization with Learnable Visual Tokens (CoOpLVT), which enhances context optimization by conditioning on visual features. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method increases the F1-score by 1.8% over the baseline, thus underlining its promise for effective DG in DR classification.

In this paper, a CAD-DR system is proposed based on preprocessing and a pre-train transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (PCNN) to recognize the five stages of DR through retinal fundus images. To develop this CAD-DR system, a preprocessing step is performed in a perceptual-oriented color space to enhance the DR-related lesions and then a standard pre-train PCNN model is improved to get high classification results. The architecture of the PCNN model is based on three main phases. Firstly, the training process of the proposed PCNN is accomplished by using the expected gradient length (EGL) to decrease the image labeling efforts during the training of the CNN model. Secondly, the most informative patches and images were automatically selected using a few pieces of training labeled samples. Thirdly, the PCNN method generated useful masks for prognostication and identified regions of interest. Fourthly, the DR-related lesions involved in the classification task such as micro-aneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates were detected and then used for recognition of DR.

Third, we discuss avenues that could facilitate the real implementation of AI into clinical practice. By stressing issues in the context of present AI applications for clinical ophthalmology, we wish to provide concepts to help promote significative investigations that will finally translate to real-world clinical use. The prevalence of diabetes has tripled in the past two decades worldwide. It can cause microvascular damage and retinal dysfunction as a result of chronic exposure to hyperglycemia, and 34.6% of people with diabetes develop DR, which is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults (20–74 years).18Burton M.J.

Their results indicated that the model developed based on UWF images may be more accurate than that based on traditional fundus images because only the UWF-image-based model could detect peripheral DR lesions without pharmacologic pupil dilation. In addition to screening for patients with referable DR (i.e., moderate and worse DR) and sight-threatening DR, detecting early-stage DR is also crucial. Evidence indicates that proper intervention to keep glucose, lipid profiles, and blood pressure under control at an early stage can significantly delay the DR progression and even reverse mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) to the DR-free stage.32Liu Y.

First, POAG, NTG, and CPACG are often painless, and visual field defects are inconspicuous at an early stage. Therefore, self-detection of these types of glaucoma by affected people usually occurs at a relatively late stage when central visual acuity is reduced.35Jonas J.B. Aung T. Bourne R.R. Bron A.M.

However, studies focusing on identifying the right disease among several candidates, which is a better approximation of clinical diagnosis in practice comparing with the case that aims to distinguish one particular eye disease from normal controls, are limited. The performance of existing algorithms for multi-class classification of fundus images is at most mediocre. Moreover, in many studies consisting of different eye diseases, labeled images are quite limited mainly due to privacy concern of patients. In this case, it is infeasible to train huge DCNNs, which usually have millions of parameters. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize a lightweight deep learning architecture called MobileNetV2 and transfer learning to distinguish four common eye diseases, including Glaucoma, Maculopathy, Pathological Myopia, and Retinitis Pigmentosa, from normal controls using a small training data. We also apply a visualization approach to highlight the loci that are most related to the disease labels to make the model more explainable.

This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques.

Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories.

This research paper is dedicated to the classification of diabetic retinopathy utilizing constrained resources while achieving elevated accuracy levels. We implemented weighted clustering technique within deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning architectures: VGG 19, DenseNet 121, and EfficientNet B6. To mitigate the challenge posed by considerable model sizes without sacrificing accuracy, the best fit results were observed with EfficientNet-B6, where applying weighted clustering reduced the model size by a factor of 12 while maintaining high accuracy results of 92% for the APTOS-2019 data. This underscores the efficacy of employing lightweight techniques to enhance the practicality of extensive models for the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. ","This study optimizes diabetic retinopathy classification using transfer learning and weighted clustering, reducing model size by 12x while maintaining 92% accuracy, making it a practical approach for early diagnosis with constrained resources."

The use of AI models solely trained on large multi-institutional datasets can help with this, yet the imperative to ensure data privacy remains, particularly as membership inference risks breaching patient confidentiality. As a proposed remedy, we advocate for the integration of differential privacy (DP). We specifically investigate the performance of models trained with DP as compared to models trained without DP on data from institutions that the model had not seen during its training (i.e., external validation) - the situation that is reflective of the clinical use of AI models. By leveraging more than 590,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we evaluated the efficacy of DP-enhanced domain transfer (DP-DT) in diagnosing cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, pneumonia, atelectasis, and in identifying healthy subjects. We juxtaposed DP-DT with non-DP-DT and examined diagnostic accuracy and demographic fairness using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the main metric, as well as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results show that DP-DT, even with exceptionally high privacy levels (epsilon around 1), performs comparably to non-DP-DT (P>0.119 across all domains). Furthermore, DP-DT led to marginal AUC differences - less than 1% - for nearly all subgroups, relative to non-DP-DT. Despite consistent evidence suggesting that DP models induce significant performance degradation for on-domain applications, we show that off-domain performance is almost not affected. Therefore, we ardently advocate for the adoption of DP in training diagnostic medical AI models, given its minimal impact on performance.

X-ray, MRI, and CT scans have all been used to validate CNN models, with classification accuracy generally reaching that of trained doctors. It is mandatory to evaluate the strength of CNN models used in medical tasks against adversarial attacks especially in healthcare, that is to say, the security of such models is becoming extremely relevant to the diagnosis as this latter will guide high-stakes decision-making. However, little study has been conducted to better comprehend this issue. This paper focuses on MobileNet CNN architecture in order to investigate its vulnerability against fast gradient sign methods (FGSM) adversarial attacks. For this end, a Neural Structure Learning (NSL) and a Multi-Head Attention (MHA) have been used to effectively reduce the vulnerability against attack by end-to-end CNN training with adversarial neighbors that produce adversarial perturbations on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. With suggested model NSL-MHA-CNN, there has been an ability to maintain model performance on adversarial attack without increasing cost of training. Through theoretical assistance and empirical validation, it was possible to examine the stability of MobileNet architecture and demonstrate its susceptibility, particularly to adversarial attack. The experiments in this paper show that indiscernible degrees of perturbation $\varepsilon < 0.01$ were sufficient to cause a task failure resulting to misclassification in majority of the time.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images provide detailed insights into the retinal vasculature, revealing intricate changes that occur as DR progresses. However, interpreting these complex images requires significant expertise and is often time-intensive. Deep learning techniques have the potential to automate DR analysis. However, they typically require large datasets for effective training. To address the challenge of limited data in this emerging imaging field, a combined approach using few-shot learning (FSL) and self-attention mechanisms within explainable AI (XAI) was explored. Objective: To investigate and evaluate the potential of an FSL-self-attention XAI approach to improve the accuracy of DR staging classification using OCTA images. Methods: A total of 206 OCTA images, comprising 104 non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and 102 proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) cases, were analyzed using the FSL method. Three pre-trained networks (ResNet-50, DenseNet-161, and MobileNet-v2) were employed, with the top-performing model subsequently integrated with the Match-Them-Up Network (MTUNet) to provide explainable interpretations using a self-attention mechanism. The performance of the models was evaluated by applying standard metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The performance of the MTUNet model is assessed by calculating pattern-matching scores for PDR and NPDR classes. Results: The ResNet-50 pre-trained model in FSL demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving an accuracy of 76.17%, a sensitivity of 81.83%, a specificity of 70.5%, and 0.82 AUC in classifying DR stages. MTUNet provided pattern-matching scores of 0.77 and 0.75 for PDR and NPDR classes, respectively. Conclusions: FSL and self-attention mechanisms in XAI offer promising approaches for accurate DR stage classification, especially in data-limited scenarios. This could potentially facilitate early DR detection and inform clinical decision-making.

Traditional methods for analyzing retinal fundus images are often manual, prolonged, and rely on the expertise of the clinician, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have introduced automated systems to assist in retinal disease detection; however, challenges such as computational inefficiency and robustness still remain. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes vision transformers (ViT) through transfer learning to address challenges in ophthalmic diagnostics. Using a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, we fine-tune it for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) classification tasks. To adapt the model for retinal fundus images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts the images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them, ensuring compatibility with the ViT architecture and improving model performance. We validated our model, OcuViT, on two datasets. We used the APTOS dataset to perform binary and five-level severity classification and the IChallenge-AMD dataset for grading age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the five-class DR and AMD grading tasks, OcuViT outperforms all existing CNN- and ViT-based methods across multiple metrics, achieving superior accuracy and robustness. For the binary DR task, it delivers highly competitive performance. These results demonstrate that OcuViT effectively leverages ViT-based transfer learning with an efficient preprocessing pipeline, significantly improving the precision and reliability of automated ophthalmic diagnosis.

Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that highly sophisticated methods for DR classification are inherently superior for domain generalization. This highlights the importance of considering simple methods and adapting them to the challenging task of generalizing medical images, rather than solely relying on advanced techniques. ","Generalizing diabetic retinopathy classification across domains using variational autoencoders achieves promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of simple methods in tackling domain shift challenges."

This paper reviews recent advances and challenges in applying AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to major eye diseases. In diabetic retinopathy, AI algorithms analyze retinal images to accurately identify lesions, which helps clinicians in ophthalmology practice. Systems like IDx- DR (IDx Technologies Inc, USA) are FDA-approved for autonomous detection of referable diabetic retinopathy. For glaucoma, deep learning models assess optic nerve head morphology in fundus photographs to detect damage. In age-related macular degeneration, AI can quantify drusen and diagnose disease severity from both color fundus and optical coherence tomography images. AI has also been used in screening for retinopathy of prematurity, keratoconus, and dry eye disease. Beyond screening, AI can aid treatment decisions by forecasting disease progression and anti- VEGF response. However, potential limitations such as the quality and diversity of training data, lack of rigorous clinical validation, and challenges in regulatory approval and clinician trust must be addressed for the widespread adoption of AI. Two other significant hurdles include the integration of AI into existing clinical workflows and ensuring transparency in AI decisionmaking processes. With continued research to address these limitations, AI promises to enable earlier diagnosis, optimized resource allocation, personalized treatment, and improved patient outcomes. Besides, synergistic human-AI systems could set a new standard for evidence-based, precise ophthalmic care.

In particular, self-supervised models show further benefits to supervised models. Self-supervised models with initialization from ImageNet pretraining not only report higher performance, they also reduce overfitting to large lesions along with improvements in taking into account minute lesions indicative of the progression of the disease.

Although adequate management of DM via regular eye examination can preserve vision in in 98% of the DR cases, DR screening and diagnoses based on clinical lesion features devised by expert clinicians; are costly, time-consuming and not sufficiently accurate. This raises the requirements for Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems which can accurately detect DR automatically and thus preventing DR before affecting vision. Hence, such systems can help clinician experts in certain cases and aid ophthalmologists in rapid diagnoses. To address such requirements, several approaches have been proposed in the literature that use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to develop such systems. However, these approaches ignore the highly valuable clinical lesion features that could contribute significantly to the accurate detection of DR. Therefore, in this study we introduce a framework called DR-detector that employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML model trained via the combination of the features extracted by the pretrained convolutional neural networks commonly known as transfer learning (TL) models and the clinical retinal lesion features for accurate detection of DR. The retinal lesion features are extracted via image segmentation technique using the UNET DL model and captures exudates (EXs), microaneurysms (MAs), and hemorrhages (HEMs) that are relevant lesions for DR detection. The feature combination approach implemented in DR-detector has been applied to two common TL models in the literature namely VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We trained the DR-detector model using a training dataset comprising of 1,840 color fundus images collected from e-ophtha, retinal lesions and APTOS 2019 Kaggle datasets of which 920 images are healthy. To validate the DR-detector model, we test the model on external dataset that consists of 81 healthy images collected from High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) dataset and MESSIDOR-2 datasets and 81 images with DR signs collected from Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) dataset annotated for DR by expert. The experimental results show that the DR-detector model achieves a testing accuracy of 100% in detecting DR after training it with the combination of ResNet-50 and lesion features and 99.38% accuracy after training it with the combination of VGG-16 and lesion features. More importantly, the results also show a higher contribution of specific lesion features toward the performance of the DR-detector model. For instance, using only the hemorrhages feature to train the model, our model achieves an accuracy of 99.38 in detecting DR, which is higher than the accuracy when training the model with the combination of all lesion features (89%) and equal to the accuracy when training the model with the combination of all lesions and VGG-16 features together. This highlights the possibility of using only the clinical features, such as lesions that are clinically interpretable, to build the next generation of robust artificial intelligence (AI) systems with great clinical interpretability for DR detection. The code of the DR-detector framework is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Janga-Lab/DR-detector and can be readily employed for detecting DR from retinal image datasets.","A framework called DR-detector is introduced that employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML model trained via the combination of the features extracted by the pretrained convolutional neural networks commonly known as transfer learning (TL) models and the clinical retinal lesion features for accurate detection of DR."

The objective of this study is to investigate diverse methodologies to address the class imbalance issue in the retinal fundus image dataset and apply transformer-based knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient DR detection. Various deep-learning models have been implemented to classify RGB fundus images into five distinct classes of DR.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, at least 1 billion people suffer from near or distance vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. These conditions cause difficulty in living a healthy lifestyle and impair individual quality of life. The article explores the application of federated learning in detecting two vision-threatening ocular diseases- diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. A federated learning framework enhances the technological capabilities of artificial intelligence that leverages decentralised data sources without creating data banks to maintain privacy. The methodology implements a federated learning environment with 2, 3, and 4 clients, using MobileNetV2 as the backbone deep learning model. The model is trained on a composite of 2 datasets procured from the Kaggle repository, comprising coloured fundus images labelled for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and normal cases. The federated learning process involves training at the client end to build client models called local models. The clients in a federated learning system only share updates regarding their local models. The original data is never shared with a central server. The server integrates these local models into the central global models using aggregation strategies such as FedAvg, FedProx, etc. Performance metrics, including prediction accuracy, class-wise accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are calculated across 30 communication rounds. The results demonstrate that the federated learning model achieves an average prediction accuracy of 96%, and a class-wise accuracy of 100% in detecting diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. The high performance of the federated learning system highlights the significance of federated learning as a viable solution for ocular disease detection while ensuring data privacy. ","This study proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning model for detecting diabetic retinopathy and macular edema, achieving 96% average prediction accuracy and 100% class-wise accuracy, leveraging decentralized data sources without compromising patient data privacy."

To address this pressing issue, we offer a novel deep-learning model that prioritizes both accurate diagnosis and privacy protection. The strength of the Efficient NetB2 model is leveraged in our proposed model, which incorporates numerous conv2d layers and activation functions to enable precise prediction and categorization of DR stages using retina images. The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-512) is used to produce unique hash values for each image, which serve as secure representations of the data. These hash values not only preserve patient privacy but also allow for the rapid identification of any unauthorized alterations to the stored images. This assures the accuracy of the diagnoses, allowing healthcare practitioners to make educated decisions while maintaining patient anonymity. Validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our suggested approach by rigorous experimentation on a large dataset.

Despite considering certain clinical requirements, like source data privacy, conventional transfer methods are predominantly model-centered and often struggle to prevent model-targeted attacks. In this paper, we address a challenging Online Model-aGnostic Domain Adaptation (OMG-DA) setting, driven by the demands of clinical environments. This setting is characterized by the absence of the model and the flow of target data. To tackle the new challenge, we propose a novel approach, Generative Unadversarial ExampleS (GUES), which enables adaptation from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first theoretically reformulate conventional perturbation optimization in a generative way--learning a perturbation generation function with a latent input variable. During model instantiation, we leverage a Variational AutoEncoder to express this function. The encoder with the reparameterization trick predicts the latent input, whilst the decoder is responsible for the generation. Furthermore, the saliency map is selected as pseudo-perturbation labels. Because it not only captures potential lesions but also theoretically provides an upper bound on the function input, enabling the identification of the latent variable. Extensive comparative experiments on DR benchmarks with both frozen pre-trained models and trainable models demonstrate the superiority of GUES, showing robustness even with small batch size.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles across the AI lifecycle.

However, due to the many privacy regulations regarding personal data, sharing data from multiple sources and storing it in a single (centralized) location for traditional ML model training is often infeasible. Federated Learning (FL), a collaborative learning paradigm, can sidestep this major pill by allowing the creation of a global ML model that is trained by aggregating model weights from individual models that are separately trained on their own data silos, therefore avoiding any data privacy concerns. This study addresses the centralized data issue by applying a novel DataWeightedFed approach for effective fundus disease diagnosis from ophthalmic images. It includes a novel method for aggregating model weights by comparing the size of each model’s data and taking a dynamically weighted average of all the model’s weights. Experimental results showed a slight average of 1.85% loss in accuracy when training using FL compared to centralized ML model systems.

Existing models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, affecting diagnostic precision and patient outcomes. The proposed model predicts three retinal statuses: normal, mild, and severe. Existing approaches in the literature may provide accurate results in ideal scenarios without adversarial threats. However, they fail to defend against adversarial attacks. In critical fields like medical diagnostics, it is crucial that predictive models can withstand such attacks to ensure high accuracy and performance.

Recently, a number of methods and large-scale datasets have been proposed to address group performance disparities.

TransFair aims to transfer a fairness-enhanced disease classification model to the task of progression prediction with fairness preserved. Specifically, we train a fair EfficientNet, termed FairEN, equipped with a fairness-aware attention mechanism using extensive data for ocular disease classification. Subsequently, this fair classification model is adapted to a fair progression prediction model through knowledge distillation, which aims to minimize the latent feature distances between the classification and progression prediction models. We evaluate FairEN and TransFair for fairness-enhanced ocular disease classification and progression prediction using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D retinal images.

Although modern scientific discoveries have shown the potential to treat eye diseases by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, explainable AI remains a crucial challenge confronting this area of research. Although some traditional methods put in significant effort, they cannot accurately predict the proper ocular diseases. However, incorporating AI into diagnosing eye diseases in healthcare complicates the situation as the decision-making process of AI demonstrates complexity, which is a significant concern, especially in major sectors like ocular disease prediction. The lack of transparency in the AI models may hinder the confidence and trust of the doctors and the patients, as well as their perception of the AI and its abilities. Accordingly, explainable AI is significant in ensuring trust in the technology, enhancing clinical decision-making ability, and deploying ocular disease detection. This research proposed an efficient transfer learning model for eye disease prediction to transform smart vision potential in the healthcare sector and meet conventional approaches' challenges while integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The integration of XAI in the proposed model ensures the transparency of the decision-making process through the comprehensive provision of rationale. This proposed model provides promising results with 95.74% accuracy and explains the transformative potential of XAI in advancing ocular healthcare. This significant milestone underscores the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately determining various types of ocular disease.

Transfer learning from an already trained deep convolutional network can be used to reduce the cost of training from scratch and to train with small training data for deep learning. This raises the question of whether we can use transfer learning to overcome the training data insufficiency problem in deep learning based medical data classifications. Deep convolutional networks have been achieving high performance results on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) image classification challenge. One example is the Inception-V3 model that was the first runner up on the ILSVRC 2015 challenge. Inception modules that help to extract different sized features of input images in one level of convolution are the unique features of the Inception-V3. In this work, we have used a pretrained Inception-V3 model to take advantage of its Inception modules for Diabetic Retinopathy detection. In order to tackle the labelled data insufficiency problem, we sub-sampled a smaller version of the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy classification challenge dataset for model training, and tested the model's accuracy on a previously unseen data subset.

Additionally, data sharing is key to fully realizing the potential of machine learning models by providing a rich and diverse collection of training data. However, the personally-identifying nature of retinal images, encompassing the unique vascular structure of each individual, often prevents this data from being shared openly. While prior works have explored image de-identification strategies based on synthetic averaging of images in other domains (e.g. facial images), existing techniques face difficulty in preserving both privacy and clinical utility in retinal images, as we demonstrate in our work. We therefore introduce k-SALSA, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework for synthesizing retinal fundus images that summarize a given private dataset while satisfying the privacy notion of k-anonymity. k-SALSA brings together state-of-the-art techniques for training and inverting GANs to achieve practical performance on retinal images. Furthermore, k-SALSA leverages a new technique, called local style alignment, to generate a synthetic average that maximizes the retention of fine-grain visual patterns in the source images, thus improving the clinical utility of the generated images. On two benchmark datasets of diabetic retinopathy (EyePACS and APTOS), we demonstrate our improvement upon existing methods with respect to image fidelity, classification performance, and mitigation of membership inference attacks. Our work represents a step toward broader sharing of retinal images for scientific collaboration.

In total, 124 peer-reviewed articles were examined following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure transparency, rigor, and reproducibility. The review highlights how federated learning has evolved from conceptual discussions to practical applications across multiple healthcare domains, including medical imaging, electronic health records, biosignals, and genomic analysis. Key findings indicate that federated architectures, particularly server–client models, have become the dominant deployment strategy, while peer-to-peer approaches are gaining attention for their resilience and decentralization. Privacy-preserving mechanisms—such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, and cryptographic computation—emerged as central to ensuring compliance with regulatory and ethical standards, with adaptive strategies allowing for an effective balance between confidentiality and model utility. Evidence from multi-institutional collaborations shows that federated learning not only improves predictive performance but also enhances inclusivity, enabling smaller or resource-limited institutions to contribute meaningfully without relinquishing data ownership. At the same time, empirical studies identified adversarial risks such as gradient inversion, membership inference, and poisoning attacks, underscoring the necessity for layered safeguards and strong governance structures. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that federated learning is more than a technical innovation; it represents a socio-technical paradigm that integrates privacy, equity, and collaboration into the development of global healthcare AI.

Using a balanced subset of 4217 images and ophthalmology-specific pretrained ViT backbones, this method demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy, offering potential for broader applications in medical imaging. Glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataracts are common eye diseases that can cause vision loss if not treated.

Unfortunately, concerns regarding data security and privacy hinder the sharing and reuse of data across sites. Existing approaches to multi-site clinical learning heavily depend on the security of the network firewall and system implementation. To address this issue, we propose Relay Learning, a secure deep-learning framework that physically isolates clinical data from external intruders while still leveraging the benefits of multi-site big data. We demonstrate the efficacy of Relay Learning in three medical tasks of different diseases and anatomical structures, including structure segmentation of retina fundus, mediastinum tumors diagnosis, and brain midline localization. We evaluate Relay Learning by comparing its performance to alternative solutions through multi-site validation and external validation. Incorporating a total of 41,038 medical images from 21 medical hosts, including 7 external hosts, with non-uniform distributions, we observe significant performance improvements with Relay Learning across all three tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance increase of 44.4%, 24.2%, and 36.7% for retinal fundus segmentation, mediastinum tumor diagnosis, and brain midline localization, respectively. Remarkably, Relay Learning even outperforms central learning on external test sets. In the meanwhile, Relay Learning keeps data sovereignty locally without cross-site network connections.

Severity of the diabetic retinopathy disease is based on presence of microaneurysms, exudates, neovascularisation and haemorrhages. Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied in many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself. In this paper, an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus is proposed. Additionally, the multistage approach to transfer learning, which makes use of similar datasets with different labelling, is experimented. The proposed architecture gives high accuracy in classification through spatial analysis. Amongst other supervised algorithms involved, proposed solution is to find a better and optimized way to classifying the fundus image with little pre-processing techniques.

By hand, eye disease diagnosis is labor-intensive, prone to mistakes, and challenging because of the variety of ocular diseases such as glaucoma (GA), diabetic retinopathy (DR), cataract (CT), and normal eye-related diseases (NL). An automated ocular disease detection system with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools is required to recognize eye-related diseases. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) algorithms enhance the classification results of retinograph images. To address these issues, we developed an intelligent detection system based on retinal fundus images. To create this system, we used ODIR and RFMiD datasets, which included various retinographics of distinct classes of the fundus, using cutting-edge image classification algorithms like ensemble-based transfer learning. In this paper, we suggest a three-step hybrid ensemble model that combines a classifier, a feature extractor, and a feature selector. The original image features are first extracted using a pre-trained AlexNet model with an enhanced structure. The improved AlexNet (iAlexNet) architecture with attention and dense layers offers enhanced feature extraction, task adaptability, interpretability, and potential accuracy benefits compared to other transfer learning architectures, making it particularly suited for tasks like retinograph classification. The extracted features are then selected using the ReliefF method, and then the most crucial elements are chosen to minimize the feature dimension. Finally, an XgBoost classifier offers classification outcomes based on the desired features. These classifications represent different ocular illnesses. We utilized data augmentation techniques to control class imbalance issues. The deep-ocular model, based mainly on the AlexNet-ReliefF-XgBoost model, achieves an accuracy of 95.13%. The results indicate the proposed ensemble model can assist dermatologists in making early decisions for the diagnosing and screening of eye-related diseases.","The results indicate the proposed ensemble model can assist dermatologists in making early decisions for the diagnosing and screening of eye-related diseases."

However, its accuracy depends on the availability of big datasets to train such a deep network. Due to the privacy concerns, the strict rules on medical data limit accessibility of images in publicly available datasets. In this paper, we propose a collaborative learning approach to train CNN models with multiple datasets while preserving the privacy of datasets in a distributed learning environment without sharing them. First, CNN networks are trained with private datasets, and tested with the same publicly available images. Based on their initial accuracies, the CNN model with the lowest performance among datasets is forwarded to second lowest performed dataset to retrain it using the transfer learning approach. Then, the retrained network is forwarded to next dataset. This procedure is repeated for each dataset from the lowest performed dataset to the highest. With this ascending chain order fashion, the network is retrained again and again using different datasets and its performance is improved over the time. Based on our experimental results on five different retina image datasets, DR detection accuracy is increased to 93.5% compared with the accuracies of merged datasets (84%) and individual datasets (73%, 78%, 83%, 85%).","A collaborative learning approach to train CNN models with multiple datasets while preserving the privacy of datasets in a distributed learning environment without sharing them is proposed."

D. Kirk Hamilton","10.20944/preprints202506.1137.v1","","The integration of machine learning (ML) in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize patient care, optimize clinical workflows, and facilitate personalized medicine. However, the utilization of electronic health records (EHRs) for training ML models raises significant privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of health data. This paper explores the emerging field of privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) as a critical approach to safeguarding patient confidentiality while enabling the effective analysis of EHRs. We systematically review various PPML techniques, including differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and federated learning, assessing their applicability in the context of healthcare data. Differential privacy is examined as a method for adding controlled noise to data outputs, ensuring that the contributions of individual patients cannot be easily inferred. We discuss its implementation challenges, particularly in maintaining the trade-off between data utility and privacy guarantees. Homomorphic encryption, which allows computations to be performed on ciphertexts, is analyzed for its capacity to secure sensitive health information during model training and inference. However, we highlight the computational complexity and resource demands associated with this technique, which may limit its practical application in real-world healthcare settings. Federated learning emerges as a promising paradigm that enables decentralized model training across multiple institutions, allowing EHRs to remain localized and secure. This section delves into the benefits of federated learning in facilitating collaborative research while addressing the challenges of communication overhead and model performance. We also consider hybrid approaches that combine multiple privacy-preserving techniques to enhance security without significantly compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate the ethical and regulatory implications of implementing PPML in healthcare, particularly in light of stringent data protection regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. The role of patient consent, data governance, and the need for transparent AI systems are discussed to ensure that privacy-preserving measures align with ethical standards and foster patient trust. In conclusion, while privacy-preserving machine learning presents a viable pathway for leveraging EHRs in healthcare analytics, ongoing research is essential to refine these techniques and address their limitations. This paper contributes to the discourse on balancing the benefits of advanced ML methodologies with the imperative of protecting patient privacy, ultimately advocating for a multidisciplinary approach that integrates insights from computer science, healthcare, and ethical governance. As the healthcare landscape evolves, the adoption of robust privacy-preserving frameworks will be pivotal in harnessing the power of machine learning while safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive health data.
