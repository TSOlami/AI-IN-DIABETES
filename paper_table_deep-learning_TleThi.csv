In particular, the detection of microaneurysms, usually the first sign of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and the detection of drusen, the hallmark of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are of primary importance. In spite of substantial progress made, detection algorithms still produce 1) false positives - target lesions are mixed up with other normal or abnormal structures in the eye, and 2) false negatives - the large variability in the appearance of the lesions causes a subset of these target lesions to be missed. We propose a general framework for detecting and characterizing target lesions almost instantaneously. This framework relies on a feature space automatically derived from a set of reference image samples representing target lesions, including atypical target lesions, and those eye structures that are similar looking but are not target lesions. The reference image samples are obtained either from an expert- or a data-driven approach. Factor analysis is used to derive the filters generating this feature space from reference samples. Previously unseen image samples are then classified in this feature space. We tested this approach by training it to detect microaneurysms. On a set of images from 2739 patients including 67 with referable DR, DR detection area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was comparable (AUC=0.927) to our previously published red lesion detection algorithm (AUC=0.929). We also tested the approach on the detection of AMD, by training it to differentiate drusen from Stargardt's disease lesions, and achieved an AUC=0.850 on a set of 300 manually detected drusen and 300 manually detected flecks. The entire image processing sequence takes less than a second on a standard PC compared to minutes in our previous approach, allowing instantaneous detection. Free-response receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed the superiority of this approach over a framework where false positives and the atypical lesions are not explicitly modeled. A greater performance was achieved by the expert-driven approach for DR detection, where the designer had sound expert knowledge. However, for both problems, a comparable performance was obtained for both expert- and data-driven approaches. This indicates that annotation of a limited number of lesions suffices for building a detection system for any type of lesion in retinal images, if no expert-knowledge is available. We are studying whether the optimal filter framework also generalizes to the detection of any structure in other domains.","A general framework for detecting and characterizing target lesions almost instantaneously, which indicates that annotation of a limited number of lesions suffices for building a detection system for any type of lesion in retinal images, if no expert-knowledge is available."

Michael D. Abràmoff","10.1109/TMI.2005.843738","","The robust detection of red lesions in digital color fundus photographs is a critical step in the development of automated screening systems for diabetic retinopathy. In this paper, a novel red lesion detection method is presented based on a hybrid approach, combining prior works by Spencer et al. (1996) and Frame et al. (1998) with two important new contributions. The first contribution is a new red lesion candidate detection system based on pixel classification. Using this technique, vasculature and red lesions are separated from the background of the image. After removal of the connected vasculature the remaining objects are considered possible red lesions. Second, an extensive number of new features are added to those proposed by Spencer-Frame. The detected candidate objects are classified using all features and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. An extensive evaluation was performed on a test set composed of images representative of those normally found in a screening set. When determining whether an image contains red lesions the system achieves a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity of 87%. The method is compared with several different automatic systems and is shown to outperform them all. Performance is close to that of a human expert examining the images for the presence of red lesions.","A novel red lesion detection method is presented based on a hybrid approach, combining prior works by Spencer et al.

Methods A prospective, masked, technology assessment was conducted for two DVRI systems at a tertiary care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Group A (n = 151 patients) was imaged with a 640x480 resolution system and group B (n = 103 patients) with an 800x600 resolution system. Four retinal evaluations were performed on each patient: DVRI with undilated pupils using one imaging field (U-DVRI), DVRI with dilated pupils using three imaging fields (D-DVRI), dilated clinical examination, and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study stereoscopic seven-field photography (ETDRS-P). Two analyses of accuracy were conducted, one using ETDRS-P as a ""gold standard"" (ETDRS-GS) and one using dilated clinical examination as a ""gold standard"" (C-GS). Results For group A, using the ETDRS-GS, sensitivities of U-DVRI and D-DVRI were 0.66 and 0.66; specificities of U-DVRI and D-DVRI were 0.66 and 0.86. Using the C-GS, sensitivities of U-DVRI and D-DVRI were 0.79 and 0.80; specificities of U-DVRI and D-DVRI were 0.68 and 0.85. For group B, using the ETDRS-GS, sensitivities of U-DVRI and D-DVRI were 0.76 and 0.85; specificities of U-DVRI and D-DVRI were 0.45 and 0.80.

Three hundred retinal images from one eye of 300 patients with diabetes were selected from a diabetic retinopathy telediagnosis database (nonmydriatic camera, two-field photography): 100 with previously diagnosed bright lesions and 200 without. A machine learning computer program was developed that can identify and differentiate among drusen, (hard) exudates, and cotton-wool spots.

Objective To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Iowa Detection Program (IDP) to detect referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR). Design and Setting In primary care DR clinics in France, from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2010, patients were photographed consecutively, and retinal color images were graded for retinopathy severity according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale and macular edema by 3 masked independent retinal specialists and regraded with adjudication until consensus. The IDP analyzed the same images at a predetermined and fixed set point. We defined RDR as more than mild nonproliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema. Participants A total of 874 people with diabetes at risk for DR. Main Outcome Measures Sensitivity and specificity of the IDP to detect RDR, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity and specificity of the retinal specialists' readings, and mean interobserver difference (κ). Results The RDR prevalence was 21.7% (95% CI, 19.0%-24.5%). The IDP sensitivity was 96.8% (95% CI, 94.4%-99.3%) and specificity was 59.4% (95% CI, 55.7%-63.0%), corresponding to 6 of 874 false-negative results (none met treatment criteria). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.937 (95% CI, 0.916-0.959). Before adjudication and consensus, the sensitivity/specificity of the retinal specialists were 0.80/0.98, 0.71/1.00, and 0.91/0.95, and the mean intergrader κ was 0.822. Conclusions The IDP has high sensitivity and specificity to detect RDR. Computer analysis of retinal photographs for DR and automated detection of RDR can be implemented safely into the DR screening pipeline, potentially improving access to screening and health care productivity and reducing visual loss through early treatment.","The IDP has high sensitivity and specificity to detect referable diabetic retinopathy and automated detection of RDR can be implemented safely into the DR screening pipeline, potentially improving access to screening and health care productivity and reducing visual loss through early treatment."

Results There was substantial agreement classifying ETDRS DR severity levels between MD and SF (kappa = 0.65, kappa(w) [linear weighted] = 0.87), MD and SD (kappa = 0.66, kappa(w) = 0.87), and SD and SF (kappa = 0.62, kappa(w) = 0.86) images. Marginal homogeneity analyses found no significant difference between MD and SF images (P = 0.53, Bhapkar test). The kappa agreement between MD and SF ranged from 0.80 to 0.94 for the presence or absence of eight ascending DR severity thresholds. Repeatability between the readers of the MD images was equal to or better than that of the readers of SD or SF images. Severity threshold grading repeatability between readers was similar with the MD and SF images. The kappa agreement between MD and SF for identifying diabetic retinopathy lesions ranged from moderate to almost perfect. The kappa comparisons showed that performance of grading new vessels on the disc in MD images was slightly lower than that with the SF images.

Design Analysis of the national database of blindness certificates of vision impairment (CVIs) received by the Certifications Office. Setting and participants Working age (16–64 years) population of England and Wales. Main outcome measures Number and cause of blindness certifications. Results The Certifications Office received 1756 CVIs for blindness from persons aged between 16 and 64 inclusive between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. The main causes of blindness certifications were hereditary retinal disorders (354 certifications comprising 20.2% of the total), diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (253 persons, 14.4%) and optic atrophy (248 persons, 14.1%). Together, these three leading causes accounted for almost 50% of all blindness certifications. Between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000, the leading causes of blindness certification were diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (17.7%), hereditary retinal disorders (15.8%) and optic atrophy (10.1%). Conclusions For the first time in at least five decades, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness among working age adults in England and Wales, having been overtaken by inherited retinal disorders. This change may be related to factors including the introduction of nationwide diabetic retinopathy screening programmes in England and Wales and improved glycaemic control. Inherited retinal disease, now representing the commonest cause of certification in the working age population, has clinical and research implications, including with respect to the provision of care/resources in the NHS and the allocation of research funding.","For the first time in at least five decades, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness among working age adults in England and Wales, having been overtaken by inherited retinal disorders."

Methods We used the previously reported consensus reference standard of referable DR (rDR), defined as International Clinical Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy moderate, severe nonproliferative (NPDR), proliferative DR, and/or macular edema (ME). Neither Messidor-2 images, nor the three retinal specialists setting the Messidor-2 reference standard were used for training IDx-DR version X2.1. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, area under the curve (AUC), and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Sensitivity was 96.8% (95% CI: 93.3%-98.8%), specificity was 87.0% (95% CI: 84.2%-89.4%), with 6/874 false negatives, resulting in a negative predictive value of 99.0% (95% CI: 97.8%-99.6%).

The majority of CNNs employed in retinal image diagnosis applications are image-based; wherein input is the retinal image and output is the classification/diagnosis, resulting in a blackbox like algorithm. In contrast, hybrid lesion-based algorithms employ multiple CNN-based detectors to categorically detect various lesions in the image, and final diagnosis is computed from combination of detector outputs. Such algorithms are more physiologically plausible and provides explainability of the final prediction through intermediate detector outputs. Both classes of algorithms have reported equal diagnostic performance and outperform clinical experts in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (rDR). However, CNNs are sensitive to adversarial images where a limited number of pixels are modified by a fraction of intensity while preserving global image context; leading to CNN misclassification. We compared diagnostic accuracy of the two classes of algorithms on adversarial images generated from rDR retinal images and results show that image-based CNNs are significantly more susceptible to adversarial images than hybrid lesion-based algorithms.","This work compared diagnostic accuracy of the two classes of algorithms on adversarial images generated from rDR retinal images and results show that image-based CNNs are significantly more susceptible to adversarialImages than hybrid lesion-based algorithms."

Krupinski","10.1167/IOVS.10-6303","","PURPOSE To evaluate digital photography parameters affecting comparability with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) film protocol for diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity grading. METHODS ETDRS protocol photographs and four variations of digital images (uncompressed stereoscopic, compressed stereoscopic, uncompressed monoscopic, and uncompressed monoscopic wide-angle mosaic) of 152 eyes were independently evaluated by using ETDRS classifications. Digital formats were compared to film and each other for agreement on severity level, DR presence at ascending threshold, presence of the DR index lesion, and repeatability of grading. Study parameters included image resolution sufficient to distinguish small lesions, color balancing of digital images to film, documenting essential ETDRS classification retinal regions, similar magnification, and supplementary green-channel viewing. RESULTS The κ statistic was substantial or near substantial between all digital formats and film for classifying severity levels (κ = 0.59-0.62; κ(w) [linear weighted] = 0.83-0.87). The distribution of DR levels in all digital formats was not significantly different from that of the film (Bhapkar test, P = 0.09-0.44). The κ among digital formats for severity level was also substantial or near substantial (κ = 0.58-0.76, κ(w) = 0.82-0.92). Differences between digital formats and film for grading severity level, severity threshold, or index lesions were not significant. The repeatability of grading between readers using film and all digital formats was also similar. CONCLUSIONS Digital format variations compared favorably with film for DR classification. Translating film characteristics (resolution, color/contrast) and protocol (magnification, retinal regions) to digital equivalents and augmentation of full color with green-channel viewing most likely contributed to the results.","Digital format variations compared favorably with film for DR classification, and Translating film characteristics and protocol to digital equivalents and augmentation of full color with green-channel viewing most likely contributed to the results."

Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation. Objective To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. Design and Setting A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency. Exposure Deep learning–trained algorithm. Main Outcomes and Measures The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity. Results The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3% (95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0% (95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%. Conclusions and Relevance In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.","An algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes."

An extensive evaluation was performed on a test set composed of images representative of those normally found in a screening set. When determining whether an image contains red lesions the system achieves a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity of 87%. The method is compared with several different automatic systems and is shown to outperform them all.

For analysis purposes, the photographic grading scales were condensed to correspond to the clinical scales, and agreement between clinicians and reading center classification were compared. Results Six thousand nine hundred and two eyes of ACCORD participants and 3,638 eyes of FIND participants were analyzed for agreement (percent, kappa) on diabetic retinopathy on a 5-level scale. Exact agreement between clinicians and reading center on diabetic retinopathy severity category was 69% in ACCORD and 74% in FIND (kappa 0.42 and 0.65). Sensitivities of the clinical grading to identify the presence of mild nonproliferative retinopathy or worse were 0.53 in ACCORD and 0.84 in FIND. Specificities were 0.97 and 0.96, respectively.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— Four screening methods (an exam by an ophthalmologist through dilated pupils using direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, an exam by a physician9s assistant through dilated pupils using direct ophthalmoscopy, a single 45° retinal photograph without pharmacological dilation, and a set of three dilated 45° retinal photographs) were compared with a reference standard of stereoscopic 30° retinal photographs of seven standard fields read by a central reading center. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated after dichotomizing the retinopathy levels into none and mild nonproliferative versus moderate to severe nonproliferative and proliferative. Two sites were used. All patients with diabetes in a VA hospital outpatient clinic between June 1988 and May 1989 were asked to participate. Patients with diabetes identified from a laboratory list of elevated serum glucose values were recruited from a DOD medical center. RESULTS— The subjects (352) had complete exams excluding the exam by the physician9s assistant that was added later. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios are as follows: ophthalmologist 0.33, 0.99, 72, 0.67; photographs without pharmacological dilation 0.61, 0.85, 4.1, 0.46; dilated photographs 0.81, 0.97, 24, 0.19; and physician9s assistant 0.14, 0.99, 12, 0.87. CONCLUSIONS— Fundus photographs taken by the 45° camera through pharmacologically dilated pupils and read by trained readers perform as well as ophthalmologists for detecting diabetic retinopathy. Physician extenders can effectively perform the photography with minimal training but would require more training to perform adequate eye exams. In this older population, many patients did not obtain adequate nonpharmacological dilation for use of the 45° camera.","Fundus photographs taken by the 45° camera through pharmacologically dilated pupils and read by trained readers perform as well as ophthalmologists for detecting diabetic retinopathy."

If, however, all relevant lesions in an image can be detected by CAD algorithms, use of CAD for automatic reading or prescreening may become feasible. This work addresses the question how to fuse information from multiple CAD algorithms, operating on multiple images that comprise an exam, to determine a likelihood that the exam is normal and would not require further inspection by human operators. We focus on retinal image screening for diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. Current CAD systems are not designed to automatically evaluate complete exams consisting of multiple images for which several detection algorithm output sets are available. Information fusion will potentially play a crucial role in enabling the application of CAD technology to the automatic screening problem. Several different fusion methods are proposed and their effect on the performance of a complete comprehensive automatic diabetic retinopathy screening system is evaluated. Experiments show that the choice of fusion method can have a large impact on system performance. The complete system was evaluated on a set of 15 000 exams (60 000 images). The best performing fusion method obtained an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.881.

To examine how mydriasis and the medical qualifications of photographers who take retinal photographs influence the accuracy of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR).


METHODS
Our meta-analysis included studies that measured the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect any DR, sight-threatening DR, or macular edema. Using random-effects logistic regression, we examined the effect of variations in mydriatic status and in medical qualifications of photographers on sensitivity and specificity.


RESULTS
Only the category of ""any DR"" had sufficient consistency in definition, number of studies (n = 20), and number of assessments (n = 40) for meta-analysis. Variations in mydriatic status did not significantly influence sensitivity (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.41; P = .61) or specificity (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.57-1.54; P = .80). Variations in medical qualifications of photographers did not significantly influence sensitivity (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.31-5.12; P = .75). Specificity of detection of any DR was significantly higher for screening methods that use a photographer with specialist medical or eye qualifications (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.78-8.37; P = .001).


CONCLUSION
Outreach screening is an effective alternative to on-site specialist examination. It has potential to increase screening coverage of high-risk patients with DR in remote and resource-poor settings without the risk of missing DR and the opportunity to prevent vision loss. Our analysis was confined to the presence or absence of DR. Future studies should use consistent DR classification schemes to facilitate further analysis.",""

Digital retinal imaging is an established method of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). It has been established that currently about 1% of the world’s blind or visually impaired is due to DR. However, the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and DR is creating an increased workload on those with expertise in grading retinal images. Safe and reliable automated analysis of retinal images may support screening services worldwide. This study aimed to compare the Iowa Detection Program (IDP) ability to detect diabetic eye diseases (DED) to human grading carried out at Moorfields Reading Centre on the population of Nakuru Study from Kenya.


Participants 
Retinal images were taken from participants of the Nakuru Eye Disease Study in Kenya in 2007/08 (n = 4,381 participants [NW6 Topcon Digital Retinal Camera]).


Methods 
First, human grading was performed for the presence or absence of DR, and for those with DR this was sub-divided in to referable or non-referable DR. The automated IDP software was deployed to identify those with DR and also to categorize the severity of DR.


Main Outcome Measures 
The primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of IDP versus the human grader as reference standard.


Results 
Altogether 3,460 participants were included. 113 had DED, giving a prevalence of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.7–3.9%). Sensitivity of the IDP to detect DED as by the human grading was 91.0% (95% CI, 88.0–93.4%). The IDP ability to detect DED gave an AUC of 0.878 (95% CI 0.850–0.905). It showed a negative predictive value of 98%. The IDP missed no vision threatening retinopathy in any patients and none of the false negative cases met criteria for treatment.


Conclusions 
In this epidemiological sample, the IDP’s grading was comparable to that of human graders’. It therefore might be feasible to consider inclusion into usual epidemiological grading.","In this epidemiological sample, the Iowa Detection Program’s grading was comparable to that of human graders’, and it therefore might be feasible to consider inclusion into usual epidemiological grading."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —We reviewed the records of 244 patients with diabetes who had a dilated funduscopic examination (DFE) and NMDSRI done within 1 year of each other at four locations in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area. The images were transmitted through a local area network to a central reading location where they were graded by a single retinal specialist. RESULTS —Images of 482 eyes from 243 patients were included in the study. Four images did not transmit, and 35% of the images were not gradable. Of the remaining 311 eyes, there was 86% agreement in the grading between NMDSRI and DFE: 227 eyes with no diabetic retinopathy and 40 eyes with diabetic retinopathy. In 46 eyes (15%) there was a disagreement between gradings made by the two techniques. NMDSRI detected diabetic retinopathy in 35 eyes reported as normal by DFE, and in the remaining 11 eyes, the DFE grade was one grade higher than the NMDSRI grade. Adjudicated nonconcordant examinations were within one grade. In the 76 eyes with diabetic retinopathy, retinal thickness could not be assessed in 17 (21%) eyes. When the NMDSRI result was gradable, the overall sensitivity of NMDSRI was 98% and the specificity was 100% for retinopathy within one grade of the DFE.

Suttorp-Schulten","10.1089/TMJ.2005.11.668","","The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ATA category 2 Web-based screening for diabetic retinopathy in a primary care population in the Netherlands. A total of 1,676 patients in a primary care setting, with diabetes, without known diabetic retinopathy, and without previous screening by an ophthalmologist, were included between January 1 and December 31, 2003. Patients underwent a brief questionnaire and two field retinal photography. Photographs were independently read by two ophthalmologists. Outcome measures were gradability of the photographs, need for pharmacologic pupil dilation, assessment as suspect for presence of diabetic retinopathy, of neovascularization and of diabetic retinopathy, and agreement between graders. Of the population studied, 11.3% of patients required pupil dilation, average transmission time of images was 73 sec, 12.0% of patients had ungradable photographs, 10.4% of the patients with gradable photographs were assessed as ""suspect for diabetic retinopathy,"" and 2.0% were assessed to need urgent referral. Red lesions were present in 3.5% and bright lesions were present in 1.6% of all gradable patients. Neovascularization of the disk was found in one patient. Type 1 patients had much higher rates of ""suspect for diabetic retinopathy"" (34.5%) than type 2 patients (9.4%). Interrater agreement kappa was 0.93. Web-based screening, using open source technology and uncompressed images, is feasible in a primary care setting, with a high rate of inter-rater agreement. Dilate-as-needed may be a sensible approach for retinal photography. The high incidence of ""suspect for diabetic retinopathy"" in type 1 diabetes patients illustrates that web-based diabetic retinopathy screening programs for these patients may detect diabetic retinopathy that would otherwise have gone undetected.","Web-based screening, using open source technology and uncompressed images, is feasible in a primary care setting, with a high rate of inter-rater agreement, and Dilate-as-needed may be a sensible approach for retinal photography."

Taylor","10.1001/ARCHOPHTHALMOL.2010.319","","Objectives To examine how mydriasis and the medical qualifications of photographers who take retinal photographs influence the accuracy of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods Our meta-analysis included studies that measured the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect any DR, sight-threatening DR, or macular edema. Using random-effects logistic regression, we examined the effect of variations in mydriatic status and in medical qualifications of photographers on sensitivity and specificity. Results Only the category of ""any DR"" had sufficient consistency in definition, number of studies (n = 20), and number of assessments (n = 40) for meta-analysis. Variations in mydriatic status did not significantly influence sensitivity (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.41; P = .61) or specificity (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.57-1.54; P = .80). Variations in medical qualifications of photographers did not significantly influence sensitivity (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.31-5.12; P = .75). Specificity of detection of any DR was significantly higher for screening methods that use a photographer with specialist medical or eye qualifications (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.78-8.37; P = .001). Conclusion Outreach screening is an effective alternative to on-site specialist examination. It has potential to increase screening coverage of high-risk patients with DR in remote and resource-poor settings without the risk of missing DR and the opportunity to prevent vision loss. Our analysis was confined to the presence or absence of DR. Future studies should use consistent DR classification schemes to facilitate further analysis.","Outreach screening is an effective alternative to on-site specialist examination and has potential to increase screening coverage of high-risk patients with DR in remote and resource-poor settings without the risk of missing DR and the opportunity to prevent vision loss."

D M Schwartz","10.2337/DIACARE.23.3.390","","The objective of this article is to stratify interventions for diabetes according to their economic impact. We conducted a review of the literature to select articles that performed a cost-benefit analysis for 17 widely practiced interventions for diabetes. A scale for categorizing interventions according to their economic impact was defined. The 17 interventions were classified as follows: 1) clearly cost-saving, 2) clearly cost-effective, 3) possibly cost-effective, 4) non-cost-effective, or 5) unclear. Clearly cost-saving interventions included eye care and pre-conception care. Clearly cost-effective interventions included nephropathy prevention in type 1 diabetes and improved glycemic control. Possibly cost-effective interventions included nephropathy prevention in type 2 diabetes and self-management training. Non-cost-effective interventions were not identified. Interventions with unclear economic impact included case management, medical nutrition therapy, self-monitoring of blood glucose, foot care, blood pressure control, blood lipid control, smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, HbA1c measurement, influenza vaccination, and pneumococcus vaccination. Widely practiced interventions for patients with diabetes can be clearly cost-saving and clearly cost-effective. These practices are attractive from both a medical and an economic perspective.","Widely practiced interventions for patients with diabetes can be clearly cost-saving and Clearly cost-effective, and these practices are attractive from both a medical and an economic perspective."
