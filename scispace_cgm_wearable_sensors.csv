Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have become important tools for providing estimates of glucose to patients with diabetes. Recently, neural networks (NNs) have become a common method for forecasting glucose values using data from CGMs. One method of forecasting glucose values is a time-delay feedforward (FF) NN, but a change in the CGM location on a participant can increase forecast error in a FF NN.


METHODS
In response, we examined a NN with gated recurrent units (GRUs) as a method of reducing forecast error due to changes in sensor location.


RESULTS
We observed that for 13 participants with type 2 diabetes wearing blinded CGMs on both arms for 12 weeks (FreeStyle Libre Pro-Abbott), GRU NNs did not produce significantly different errors in glucose prediction due to sensor location changes (P < .05).


CONCLUSION
We observe that GRU NNs can mitigate error in glucose prediction due to differences in CGM location.","It is observed that GRU NNs can mitigate error in glucose prediction due to differences in CGM location, and should be considered as a method of reducing forecast error due to changes in sensor location."

However, the soaring costs of insulin present significant challenges to ensuring affordable management. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of current literature on the application of machine learning (ML) in insulin management for diabetes patients, particularly focusing on enhancing affordability and accessibility within the United States. The review encompasses various facets of insulin management, including dosage calculation and response, prediction of blood glucose and insulin sensitivity, initial insulin estimation, resistance prediction, treatment adherence, complications, hypoglycemia prediction, and lifestyle modifications. Additionally, the study identifies key limitations in the utilization of ML within the insulin management literature and suggests future research directions aimed at furthering accessible and affordable insulin treatments. These proposed directions include exploring insurance coverage, optimizing insulin type selection, assessing the impact of biosimilar insulin and market competition, considering mental health factors, evaluating insulin delivery options, addressing cost-related issues affecting insulin usage and adherence, and selecting appropriate patient cost-sharing programs. By examining the potential of ML in addressing insulin management affordability and accessibility, this work aims to envision improved and cost-effective insulin management practices.

Effective management of diabetes, particularly monitoring and prediction of blood glucose levels, remains a significant challenge due to the severe health risks associated with inaccuracies, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. This study addresses this critical issue by employing a hybrid Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model designed to enhance the accuracy of future glucose level predictions based on data from Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems. This innovative approach aims to reduce the risk of diabetic complications and improve patient outcomes. We utilized a dataset which contain more than 32000 data points comprising CGM data from eight patients collected by Suzhou Municipal Hospital in Jiangsu Province, China. This dataset includes historical glucose readings and equipment calibration values, making it highly suitable for developing predictive models due to its richness and real-time applicability. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid Transformer-LSTM model significantly outperforms the standard LSTM model, achieving Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 1.18, 1.70, and 2.00 at forecasting intervals of 15, 30, and 45 minutes, respectively. This research underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in the proactive management of diabetes, a critical step toward mitigating its impact.

Trend arrows are the only way to look into the future, but they are often too imprecise for therapy adjustment. While AID systems provide algorithms to use glucose values for glucose control, this has not been possible with stand-alone CGM systems, which are most used by people with diabetes. By analyzing the measured values with algorithms, often supported by AI, this should be possible in the future. This provides the user with important information about the further course of the glucose level, such as during the night. Predictive approaches can be used by next-generation CGM systems. These systems can proactively prevent glucose events such as hypo- or hyperglycemia. With the Accu-Chek® SmartGuide Predict app, an integral part of a novel CGM system, and the Glucose Predict (GP) feature, people with diabetes have the first commercially available CGM system with predictive algorithms. It characterizes the CGM systems of the future, which not only analyze past values and current glucose values in the future, but also use these values to predict future glucose progression.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of AI-DSS in real world diabetes clinics.
 Methods: Data was collected and evaluated from routine AI-DSS usage for individuals with type 1 diabetes treated at 21 diabetes clinics (in the USA and 2 in Israel) . Two analyses were made: (1) Insulin dose recommendations were compared for rate of agreement/disagreement between those suggested by the AI-DSS and the approved recommendations by health care providers (HCP) . (2) Glycemic outcomes were compared between baseline and after 3 months of AI-DSS use. Included in this analysis were individuals who had mean baseline glucose level ≥ 182 mg/dL and at least one AI-DSS recommendation within the 3-months.
 Results: A total of 8 recommendations, provided to 370 individuals, were evaluated. Full agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments was observed in 87%, 87%, and 83% of the basal rate, carbs ratio (CR) , and correction factor (CF) pump settings parameters, respectively. Full disagreement on the direction of dose change was observed in only 0.9%, 0.5%, and 1.2% for the basal rate, CR and CF, respectively. Glycemic outcome analysis included 1 eligible individuals (mean of 1.6 recommendations within a 3-month interval) . Average sensor percentage of time in range [70-180 mg/dL] increased by 4% (p=0.003) : 43% increased time in range by more than 5% and 33% increased by 10% or more. Time in hyperglycemia [> 180 mg/dL] was reduced by 5% (p<0.01) while time in severe hypoglycemia [< 54 mg/dL] remained below 0.5%.
 Conclusion: A high rate of agreement with automated insulin adjustments was observed among HCPs at academic centers who used the AI-DSS in their workflow. Glycemic control was significantly improved for sub-optimally controlled individuals already after 3-months of follow up.

Effective management of blood glucose is essential for individuals with diabetes to mitigate these risks. This study introduces the Glu-Ensemble, a deep learning framework designed for precise blood glucose forecasting in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike other predictive models, Glu-Ensemble addresses challenges related to small sample sizes, data quality issues, reliance on strict statistical assumptions, and the complexity of models. It enhances prediction accuracy and model generalizability by utilizing larger datasets and reduces bias inherent in many predictive models. The framework's unified approach, as opposed to patient-specific models, eliminates the need for initial calibration time, facilitating immediate blood glucose predictions for new patients. The obtained results indicate that Glu-Ensemble surpasses traditional methods in accuracy, as measured by root mean square error, mean absolute error, and error grid analysis. The Glu-Ensemble framework emerges as a promising tool for blood glucose level prediction in type 2 diabetes patients, warranting further investigation in clinical settings for its practical application.

José-Víctor Rodríguez","10.1016/j.iot.2023.100945","","The chronic metabolic condition, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), is marked by consistent hyperglycemia due to the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin. This necessitates the patient's daily monitoring of blood glucose fluctuations to discern a trend and predict future glycemia, subsequently dictating the amount of external insulin needed to regulate glycemia effectively. However, this technique often grapples with a degree of inaccuracy, presenting potential hazards. Nonetheless, contemporary advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) coupled with novel biological signal sensors offer a refreshing perspective for DM1 management by enabling comprehensive, continual patient health evaluation. Herein, burgeoning technological disruptions such as Big Data, the internet of medical things (IoMT), cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms (ML) could serve pivotal roles in the effective control of DM1. This paper delves into the exploration of the latest IoMT-based methodologies for the unbroken surveillance of DM1 management, facilitating a profound characterization of diabetic patients. The fusion of wearable technologies with machine learning strategies has the potential to yield robust models for short-term blood glucose prediction. The ambition of this study is to develop precise, individual-centric prediction models harnessing an array of pertinent factors. The study applied modeling techniques to a comprehensive dataset comprising glycaemia-associated biological attributes, sourced from an expansive passive monitoring campaign involving 40 DM1 patients. Leveraging the Random Forest method, the resulting models can predict glucose levels over a 30-min time span with an average error as minimal as 18.60 mg/dL for six-hour data and 26.21 mg/dL for a 45-minute prediction horizon, offering also a good performance in the prediction delay.

For these individuals, insurance covers a limited amount of testing supplies, and blood glucose (BG) checks are infrequent. With limited BG data, people may not know how foods, activity, and other factors affect their BG levels. Other, non-SMBG-dependent, approaches are needed to illustrate how self-care choices affect BG. Objectives: 1.) Use a large dataset to train a machine learning model 2.) Use the model and minimal data inputs to predict BG values at variable times 3.) Test the accuracy of the prediction. Methods: The One Drop | Mobile app collected 1,923,416 BG measurements from 14,706 people with noninsulin treated T2D. Contextual information (CI), when available, included demographics, health metrics (e.g., weight, A1c), and self-care. Inputs to each BG prediction included a prior BG and available CI. The model did not distinguish whether BGs with similar CI were from the same or different users. Forecast horizons were set by the time since prior BG and varied from 10 minutes to several days. Machine learning algorithms to predict BG values were trained and vetted on BGs entered prior to Sept. 2017 (83% of all BGs). BGs (17%) entered from Sept.-Nov. 2017 were held out and predicted. Results: Users were 59% male, with 80% from North America, 9% from Europe, and 11% from elsewhere; 50% were diagnosed with T2D in the past 3 years. The median and mean absolute error of holdout predictions were 14.2 and 21.3 mg/dL respectively, with 91% of predictions within +/-50 mg/dL. Discussion: A machine learning model with minimal inputs accurately predicts future BG values in noninsulin treated people with T2D. Whether people modify their behavior (e.g., eating less carbohydrates) after knowing a planned behavior (e.g., a 60 carbohydrate gram meal) produces an undesirable BG (>140 mg/dL postprandial) is an empirical question worth investigating.

Employing recurrent neural network (RNN) modules, the proposed framework uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised training to learn temporal dynamics in latent spaces. Aiming to assess the quality of synthetic data, we apply clinical metrics, distance scores, and discriminative and predictive scores computed by post-hoc RNNs in evaluation. Across three clinical datasets with 47 T1D subjects (including one publicly available and two proprietary datasets), GluGAN achieved better performance for all the considered metrics when compared with four baseline GAN models. The performance of data augmentation is evaluated by three machine learning-based glucose predictors. Using the training sets augmented by GluGAN significantly reduced the root mean square error for the predictors over 30 and 60-minute horizons. The results suggest that GluGAN is an effective method in generating high-quality synthetic glucose time series and has the potential to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of automated insulin delivery algorithms and as a digital twin to substitute for pre-clinical trials.","GluGAN as mentioned in this paper is a framework specifically designed for generating personalized glucose time series based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), employing recurrent neural network (RNN) modules."

This focus is reflected in conference topics, strategy documents, technology appraisals and funding streams. What is often overlooked is the wider application of data and AI, as demonstrated through published literature and emerging marketplace products, that offers promising avenues for enhanced clinical care, health-service efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This review provides an overview of AI techniques and explores the use and potential of AI and data-driven systems in a broad context, covering all diabetes types, encompassing: (1) patient education and self-management; (2) clinical decision support systems and predictive analytics, including diagnostic support, treatment and screening advice, complications prediction; and (3) the use of multimodal data, such as imaging or genetic data. The review provides a perspective on how data- and AI-driven systems could transform diabetes care in the coming years and how they could be integrated into daily clinical practice. We discuss evidence for benefits and potential harms, and consider existing barriers to scalable adoption, including challenges related to data availability and exchange, health inequality, clinician hesitancy and regulation. Stakeholders, including clinicians, academics, commissioners, policymakers and those with lived experience, must proactively collaborate to realise the potential benefits that AI-supported diabetes care could bring, whilst mitigating risk and navigating the challenges along the way.

Traditional clinical testing relies on fingertip or venous blood collection, which has facilitated the emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology to address data limitations. Continuous glucose monitoring technology is recognized for tracking long-term blood glucose fluctuations, and its development, particularly in wearable devices, has given rise to compact and portable continuous glucose monitoring devices, which facilitates the measurement of blood glucose and adjustment of medication. This review introduces the development of wearable CGM-based technologies, including noninvasive methods using body fluids and invasive methods using implantable electrodes. The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed as well as the use of microneedle arrays in minimally invasive CGM. Microneedle arrays allow for painless transdermal puncture and are expected to facilitate the development of wearable CGM devices. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities and look forward to the biomedical applications and future directions of wearable CGM-based technologies in biological research.

Advanced time blood glucose level prediction enables diabetic patients to better manage their blood glucose levels and receive early warnings about the wrong treatments and adverse conditions such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. In this study, an artificial neural network is trained for 30- and 60-min prediction horizon by using physiological models for insulin injection, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity in addition to past CGM data for each of six real T1D patients. The mean of the prediction error for six patients is obtained as 18.81 mg/dL and 30.89 mg/dL for 30- and 60-min prediction horizons, respectively. These results are better than the other studies in the literature that use real patient data, and the model is computationally simpler compared to the deep learning-based methods.

However, developing a model generalized to a population and subsequently embedding it within a microchip of a wearable device presents significant technical challenges. Furthermore, the domain of BG prediction in T2D remains under-explored in the literature.

This device seamlessly communicates with CGM systems through Bluetooth and provides timely BG predictions using edge computing. When evaluated on two publicly available clinical datasets with a total of 124 participants with T1D or T2D, the embedded TFT model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest prediction errors when compared with a range of machine learning baseline methods. Executing the TFT model on our wearable device requires minimal memory and power consumption, enabling continuous decision support for more than 51 days on a single Li-Poly battery charge.

Type 1 DM (DM1) constitutes the insulin-dependent manifestation from disease onset. Effective DM1 management necessitates daily blood glucose monitoring, pattern recognition, and cognitive prediction of future glycemic levels to ascertain the requisite exogenous insulin dosage. Nevertheless, this methodology may prove imprecise and perilous. The advent of groundbreaking developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), encompassing Big Data, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning algorithms (ML), has facilitated continuous DM1 management monitoring. This investigation concentrates on IoMT-based methodologies for the unbroken observation of DM1 management, thereby enabling comprehensive characterization of diabetic individuals. Integrating machine learning techniques with wearable technology may yield dependable models for forecasting short-term blood glucose concentrations. The objective of this research is to devise precise person-specific short-term prediction models, utilizing an array of features. To accomplish this, inventive modeling strategies were employed on an extensive dataset comprising glycaemia-related biological attributes gathered from a large-scale passive monitoring initiative involving 40 DM1 patients. The models produced via the Random Forest approach can predict glucose levels within a 30-minute horizon with an average error of 18.60 mg/dL for six-hour data, and 26.21 mg/dL for a 45-minute prediction horizon.

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.","This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field."

Accurate blood glucose prediction can reduce this risk and enhance early interventions to improve diabetes management. However, due to the complex nature of glucose metabolism and the various lifestyle related factors which can disrupt this, diabetes management still remains challenging. In this work we propose a novel deep learning model to predict future BG levels based on the historical continuous glucose monitoring measurements, meal ingestion, and insulin delivery. We adopt a modified architecture of the generative adversarial network that comprises of a generator and a discriminator. The generator computes the BG predictions by a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units, and the auxiliary discriminator employs a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to distinguish between the predictive and real BG values. Two modules are trained in an adversarial process with a combination of loss. The experiments were conducted using the OhioT1DM dataset that contains the data of six T1D contributors over 40 days.

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements. These results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D. The well-trained models can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts.","Results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D and can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts."

Several algorithms based on model predictive control and reinforcement learning (RL) have been proposed so far, most of which use prior knowledge of physiological systems, the mathematical structure of blood glucose dynamics, and many episodes including failures for training the policy network in RL. To be smoothly adopted in clinical settings, we propose a fast online learning method underlining safety and interpretability. A random forest regressor and a dual attention network were exploited for glucose prediction and extension of state variables. The soft actor-critic network to determine insulin dosing was guided by proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control in the early phase, and an adaptive safe actor with suspension and additional insulin dosing was incorporated. The performance of the models was validated using an FDA-approved type 1 diabetes simulator. The results showed comparable outcomes with PID control. Using this system, glucose dynamics could be captured despite minimal prior knowledge. The extended state variables were correlated with basic states such as glucose, insulin, and meal intake, their derivatives, and their integrals, which can be fundamental elements of mathematical modeling of physiological responses. Attention scores and attribution scores in the prediction and control models represented the focused features and the internal operation of the models with interpretability. We expect this study to provide some insights on how RL can be practically adopted in clinical environments and how interpretability can provide hints of machines’ thoughts for clinical applications.","In this paper, a soft actor-critic network was used to determine insulin dosing in the early phase, and an adaptive safe actor with suspension and additional insulin dose was incorporated."

Multitask learning facilitates an approach for leveraging data from multiple subjects while still learning accurate personalised models. In this work we present results comparing the effectiveness of multitask learning over sequential transfer learning, and learning only on subject-specific data with neural network and support vector regression. The multitask learning approach shows consistent leading performance in predictive metrics at both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.

We also identify relevant prior information such as glycaemic variability that can be incorporated to improve predictive performance at long-term prediction horizons. Furthermore, we show consistent performance - ≤ 5% change in both RMSE and EGA (Zone A) - in rare cases of adverse glycaemic events with 1-6 weeks of training data.

However, recent Internet of Things (IoT) devices and novel biosensors have allowed the continuous collection of the value of the glucose level by means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) so that, with the proper Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, glucose evolution can be modeled, thus permitting a forecast of this variable. On the other hand, glycaemia dynamics require that such a model be user-centric and should be recalculated continuously in order to reflect the exact status of the patient, i.e., an 'on-the-fly' approach. In order to avoid, for example, the risk of being disconnected from the Internet, it would be ideal if this task could be performed locally in constrained devices like smartphones, but this would only be feasible if the execution times were fast enough. Therefore, in order to analyze if such a possibility is viable or not, an extensive, passive, CGM study has been carried out with 25 DM1 patients in order to build a solid dataset. Then, some well-known univariate algorithms have been executed in a desktop computer (as a reference) and two constrained devices: a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi, taking into account only past glycaemia data to forecast glucose levels. The results indicate that it is possible to forecast, in a smartphone, a 15-min horizon with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 11.65 mg/dL in just 16.15 s, employing a 10-min sampling of the past 6 h of data and the Random Forest algorithm. With the Raspberry Pi, the computational effort increases to 56.49 s assuming the previously mentioned parameters, but this can be improved to 34.89 s if Support Vector Machines are applied, achieving in this case an RMSE of 19.90 mg/dL. Thus, this paper concludes that local on-the-fly forecasting of glycaemia would be affordable with constrained devices.","An extensive, passive, CGM study with 25 DM1 patients concludes that local on-the-fly forecasting of glycaemia would be affordable with constrained devices."

Advances in IoT devices, such as continuous blood glucose monitors (CGMs) have made it convenient for measurements of blood glucose in real time. However, accurate and personalized blood glucose concentration prediction is still challenging. Previous inference models yield low-inference accuracy due to the ineffective feature extraction and the limited, imbalanced personal training data. The underlying causal correlations among the blood glucose series are scarcely captured by these models. In this article, we propose CausalBG, a causal recurrent neural network (CausalRNN) deployed on an IoT platform with smartphones and CGM for the accurate and efficient individual blood glucose concentration prediction. CausalBG automatically captures the underlying causal relationships embedded in the blood glucose features through CausalRNN, and efficiently shares the limited personal data among users for the sufficient training via the multitask framework. Evaluations and case studies on 112 users demonstrate that CausalBG significantly outperforms the conventional predictive models on the blood glucose dynamics inference.","CausalBG is proposed, a causal recurrent neural network deployed on an IoT platform with smartphones and CGM for the accurate and efficient individual blood glucose concentration prediction, and significantly outperforms the conventional predictive models on the blood glucose dynamics inference."

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements. These results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D. The well-trained models can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts.

The only input of this kind of algorithm is often continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor data, because other signals (such as injected insulin, ingested carbs, and physical activity) are frequently unavailable. Several predictive algorithms fed by CGM data only have been proposed in the literature, but they were assessed using datasets originated by different experimental protocols, making a comparison of their relative merits difficult. The aim of the present work was to perform a head-to-head comparison of thirty different linear and nonlinear predictive algorithms using the same dataset, given by 124 CGM traces collected over 10 days with the newest Dexcom G6 sensor available on the market and considering a 30-min prediction horizon. We considered the state-of-the art methods, investigating, in particular, linear black-box methods (autoregressive; autoregressive moving-average; and autoregressive integrated moving-average, ARIMA) and nonlinear machine-learning methods (support vector regression, SVR; regression random forest; feed-forward neural network, fNN; and long short-term memory neural network). For each method, the prediction accuracy and hypoglycemia detection capabilities were assessed using either population or individualized model parameters. As far as prediction accuracy is concerned, the results show that the best linear algorithm (individualized ARIMA) provides accuracy comparable to that of the best nonlinear algorithm (individualized fNN), with root mean square errors of 22.15 and 21.52 mg/dL, respectively. As far as hypoglycemia detection is concerned, the best linear algorithm (individualized ARIMA) provided precision = 64%, recall = 82%, and one false alarm/day, comparable to the best nonlinear technique (population SVR): precision = 63%, recall = 69%, and 0.5 false alarms/day. In general, the head-to-head comparison of the thirty algorithms fed by CGM data only made using a wide dataset shows that individualized linear models are more effective than population ones, while no significant advantages seem to emerge when employing nonlinear methodologies.","In this paper, a head-to-head comparison of thirty different linear and nonlinear predictive algorithms using the same dataset, given by 124 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) traces collected over 10 days with the newest Dexcom G6 sensor available on the market and considering a 30-min prediction horizon was performed."

The ability to predict future glucose values can further optimize such devices. In this study, we used machine learning to train models in predicting future glucose levels based on prior CGM and accelerometry data. Methods We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observational population‐based cohort that comprises individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We included individuals who underwent >48h of CGM (n = 851), most of whom (n = 540) simultaneously wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity. A random subset of individuals was used to train models in predicting glucose levels at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on either CGM data or both CGM and accelerometer data. In the remaining individuals, model performance was evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE), Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rho) and surveillance error grid. For a proof-of-concept translation, CGM-based prediction models were optimized and validated with the use of data from individuals with type 1 diabetes (OhioT1DM Dataset, n = 6). Results Models trained with CGM data were able to accurately predict glucose values at 15 (RMSE: 0.19mmol/L; rho: 0.96) and 60 minutes (RMSE: 0.59mmol/L, rho: 0.72). Model performance was comparable in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Incorporation of accelerometer data only slightly improved prediction. The error grid results indicated that model predictions were clinically safe (15 min: >99%, 60 min >98%). Our prediction models translated well to individuals with type 1 diabetes, which is reflected by high accuracy (RMSEs for 15 and 60 minutes of 0.43 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively) and clinical safety (15 min: >99%, 60 min: >91%). Conclusions Machine learning-based models are able to accurately and safely predict glucose values at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on CGM data only.

Developing a robust blood glucose (BG) prediction model has a profound influence especially important for the diabetes management. Subjects with diabetes need to adjust insulin doses according to the blood glucose levels to maintain blood glucose in a target range. An accurate glucose level prediction is able to provide subjects with diabetes with the future glucose levels, so that proper actions could be taken to avoid shortterm dangerous consequences or long-term complications. With the developing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, the accuracy of predicting the glucose levels can be improved using the machine learning techniques.

Self-management of diabetes including maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential for glycemic control and to prevent diabetes complications. Mobile-based health data can play an important role in the forecasting of blood glucose levels for lifestyle management and control of T2DM. Objective: The objective of this work was to dynamically forecast daily glucose levels in patients with T2DM based on their daily mobile health lifestyle data including diet, physical activity, weight, and glucose level from the day before. Methods: We used data from 10 T2DM patients who were overweight or obese in a behavioral lifestyle intervention using mobile tools for daily monitoring of diet, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose over 6 months. We developed a deep learning model based on long short-term memory–based recurrent neural networks to forecast the next-day glucose levels in individual patients. The neural network used several layers of computational nodes to model how mobile health data (food intake including consumed calories, fat, and carbohydrates; exercise; and weight) were progressing from one day to another from noisy data. Results: The model was validated based on a data set of 10 patients who had been monitored daily for over 6 months. The proposed deep learning model demonstrated considerable accuracy in predicting the next day glucose level based on Clark Error Grid and ±10% range of the actual values. Conclusions: Using machine learning methodologies may leverage mobile health lifestyle data to develop effective individualized prediction plans for T2DM management. However, predicting future glucose levels is challenging as glucose level is determined by multiple factors. Future study with more rigorous study design is warranted to better predict future glucose levels for T2DM management.","A deep learning model based on long short-term memory–based recurrent neural networks was developed to forecast the next-day glucose levels in patients with T2DM based on their daily mobile health lifestyle data including diet, physical activity, weight, and glucose level from the day before."

We developed a series of these models using different machine learning time series forecasting techniques suitable for execution within a wearable processor. We conducted an extensive passive patient monitoring study in real-world conditions to build an appropriate data set. The study involved a subset of type 1 diabetic subjects wearing a flash glucose monitoring system. We comparatively and quantitatively evaluated the performance of the developed data-driven prediction models and the corresponding machine learning techniques. Our results indicate that very accurate short-term prediction can be achieved by only monitoring interstitial glucose data over a very short time period and using a low sampling frequency. The models developed can predict glucose levels within a 15-min horizon with an average error as low as 15.43 mg/dL using only 24 historic values collected within a period of sex hours, and by increasing the sampling frequency to include 72 values, the average error is reduced to 10.15 mg/dL. Our prediction models are suitable for execution within a wearable device, requiring the minimum hardware requirements while at simultaneously achieving very high prediction accuracy.","The objective of this work was to investigate the minimum data variety, volume, and velocity required to create accurate person-centric short-term prediction models and develop a series of these models suitable for execution within a wearable processor."

In recent years, deep learning techniques have been utilized for a more accurate BG level prediction system. However, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) readings are susceptible to sensor errors. As a result, inaccurate CGM readings would affect BG prediction and make it unreliable, even if the most optimal machine learning model is used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to predicting blood glucose level with a stacked Long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model considering sensor fault. We use the Kalman smoothing technique for the correction of the inaccurate CGM readings due to sensor error. For the OhioT1DM (2018) dataset, containing eight weeks’ data from six different patients, we achieve an average RMSE of 6.45 and 17.24 mg/dl for 30 min and 60 min of prediction horizon (PH), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the leading average prediction accuracy for the ohioT1DM dataset. Different physiological information, e.g., Kalman smoothed CGM data, carbohydrates from the meal, bolus insulin, and cumulative step counts in a fixed time interval, are crafted to represent meaningful features used as input to the model. The goal of our approach is to lower the difference between the predicted CGM values and the fingerstick blood glucose readings—the ground truth. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is feasible for more reliable BG forecasting that might improve the performance of the artificial pancreas and insulin infusion system for T1D diabetes management.","In this paper, a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) was used to predict the blood glucose level with a stacked LSTM-based deep recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) model considering sensor error."

Methods: The ML algorithms include ML-based regression models and deep learning models such as a vanilla Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Network and a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN). Evaluations have been conducted with respect to different input features, regression model orders, as well as using the recursive method or direct method for multi-step prediction of BG levels. Prediction performance metrics include the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), temporal gain (TG) for early prediction, and the normalized energy of the second-order differences (ESOD) of the predicted time series to reflect risk of false alerts on hypo/hyper glycemia events. Results: The ARX model achieved the lowest average RMSE for both recursive and direct methods, the second highest average TG under the direct method, but with a higher average normalized ESOD than some other models. Conclusion: There was no significant advantage observed from the ML models compared to the classic ARX model in predicting BG levels for T1D, except that TCN's performance was more robust with respect to BG trajectories with spurious oscillations, for which ARX tended to over-predict peak BG values and under-predict valley BG values.

Study characteristics (author, country, type of publication, study design, population characteristics, mean age, types of noninvasive techniques used, and application, as well as characteristics of the BGM systems) were extracted independently and cross-checked by 2 investigators. Methodological quality appraisal was conducted using the Checklist for assessment of medical AI.


RESULTS
A total of 33 papers were included, representing studies from Asia, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa published between 2005 and 2023. Most studies used optical techniques (n=19, 58%) to estimate blood glucose levels (n=27, 82%). Others used electrochemical sensors (n=4), imaging (n=2), mixed techniques (n=2), and tissue impedance (n=1). Accuracy ranged from 35.56% to 94.23% and Clarke error grid (A+B) ranged from 86.91% to 100%. The most popular machine learning algorithm used was random forest (n=10) and the most popular deep learning model was the artificial neural network (n=6). The mean overall checklist for assessment of medical AI score on the included papers was 33.5 (SD 3.09), suggesting an average of medium quality. The studies reviewed demonstrate that some AI techniques can accurately predict glucose levels from noninvasive sources while enhancing comfort and ease of use for patients. However, the overall range of accuracy was wide due to the heterogeneity of models and input data.


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts are needed to standardize and regulate the use of AI technologies in BGM, as well as develop consensus guidelines and protocols to ensure the quality and safety of AI-assisted monitoring systems. The use of AI for NIBGM is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize diabetes management.","This scoping review maps AI applications in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, finding 33 studies with varying accuracy (35.56-94.23%) and quality, highlighting the need for standardization and regulation of AI technologies in BGM."

Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability.

This work concerns the problem of interpretable personalized blood glucose (BG) prediction that is crucial for diabetes management. Although encouraging results of machine-learning (ML) methods have been shown in short-term prediction, the lack of interpretability in models trained on limited data reduces the acceptance for practice use, especially for long-term postprandial BG prediction. To address this problem, a physiology-informed Gaussian process (GP) model with a neural mean function is proposed, in which the prior knowledge of glycometabolism is incorporated into the model optimization process to guarantee interpretable model learning and strengthen the ability of capturing key glucose dynamics. Besides, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is utilized to enhance the model adaptability for personalized prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through the comparative results obtained by using the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova T1DM simulator and the clinical datasets. Among all the considered approaches, the proposed approach achieved the lowest RMSE on the in silico dataset, as well as in 3 and 4 h prediction on the clinical dataset.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate explainable prediction models based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and baseline data to identify a week-to-week risk of CGM key metrics (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, glycemic variability). By having a weekly prediction of CGM key metrics, it is possible for the patient or health care personnel to take immediate preemptive action.


METHODS
We analyzed, trained, and internally tested three prediction models (Logistic regression, XGBoost, and TabNet) using CGM data from 187 type 1 diabetes patients with long-term CGM monitoring. A binary classification approach combined with feature engineering deployed on the CGM signals was used to predict hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability based on consensus targets (time above range ≥5%, time below range ≥4%, coefficient of variation ≥36%). The models were validated in two independent cohorts with a total of 223 additional patients of varying ages.


RESULTS
A total of 46 593 weeks of CGM data were included in the analysis. For the best model (XGBoost), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was 0.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89-0.91], 0.89 [95% CI = 0.88-0.9], and 0.8 [95% CI = 0.79-0.81] for predicting hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability in the interval validation, respectively. The validation test showed good generalizability of the models with ROC-AUC of 0.88 to 0.95, 0.84 to 0.89, and 0.80 to 0.82 for predicting the glycemic outcomes.


CONCLUSION
Prediction models based on real-world CGM data can be used to predict the risk of unstable glycemic control in the forthcoming week. The models showed good performance in both internal and external validation cohorts.","This study develops and validates explainable machine-learning models to predict weekly risk of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability in type 1 diabetes patients using continuous glucose monitoring data, achieving high accuracy in internal and external validation cohorts."

Samantha Kleinberg","10.1109/tbme.2024.3494732","","For people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), accurate blood glucose (BG) forecasting is crucial for the effective delivery of insulin by Artificial Pancreas (AP) systems. Deep learning frameworks like Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) have been widely used to predict BG using continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data. However, these methods usually require large amounts of training data for personalized forecasts. Moreover, individuals with diabetes exhibit diverse glucose variability (GV), resulting in varying forecast accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework: Incrementally Retrained Stacked LSTM (IS-LSTM). This approach gradually adapts to individuals' data and employs parameter-transfer for efficiency. We compare our method to three benchmarks using two CGM datasets from individuals with T1D: OpenAPS and Replace-BG. On both datasets, our approach significantly reduces root mean square error compared to the state of the art (Stacked LSTM): from 14.55 to 10.23mg/dL (OpenAPS) and 17.15 to 13.41mg/dL (Replace-BG) at 30-minute Prediction Horizon (PH). Clarke error grid analysis demonstrates clinical feasibility with at least 98.81% and 97.25% of predictions within the clinically safe zone at 30- and 60-minute PHs. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cold-start scenarios, which helps new CGM users obtain accurate predictions.

To address this, we propose BiT-MAML, a hybrid model combining a Bidirectional LSTM-Transformer with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. We evaluated our model using a rigorous Leave-One-Patient-Out Cross-Validation (LOPO-CV) on the OhioT1DM dataset, ensuring a fair comparison against re-implemented LSTM and Edge-LSTM baselines. The results show our model achieved a mean RMSE of 24.89 mg/dL for the 30 min prediction horizon, marking a substantial improvement of 19.3% over the standard LSTM and 14.2% over the Edge-LSTM. Notably, our model also achieved the lowest standard deviation (±4.60 mg/dL), indicating more consistent and generalizable performance across the patient cohort. A key finding of our study is the confirmation of significant performance variability across individuals, a known clinical challenge. This was evident as our model's 30 min RMSE ranged from an excellent 19.64 mg/dL to a more challenging 30.57 mg/dL, reflecting the inherent difficulty of personalizing predictions rather than model instability. From a clinical safety perspective, Clarke Error Grid Analysis confirmed the model's robustness, with over 92% of predictions falling within the clinically acceptable Zones A and B. This study concludes that the development of effective personalized BG prediction requires not only advanced model architectures but also robust evaluation methods that transparently report the full spectrum of performance, providing a realistic pathway toward reliable clinical tools.

Recently, studies have evaluated a broadening role of CGM beyond insulin dosing titration guidance: CGM has been considered as a diagnostic tool for staging of (pre)type 1 diabetes (T1D), for therapy modification guidance for non-insulin-treated individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), or as an outcome measure for clinical trials.In the present article, we highlight key publications that provide further evidence for routine CGM use; novel data from large, well-established registries; and data from a broader spectrum of diabetes care, including non-insulin-treated T2D, staging of (pre)T1D, and within clinical trials evaluating the effects of therapeutic interventions; and possibly uncover novel aspects of diabetes care where the use of CGM could further facilitate and advance the excellence of our routine clinical care.Key Articles ReviewedContinuous Glucose Monitoring versus Blood Glucose Monitoring for Risk of Severe Hypoglycaemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes: A Population-based StudyKarges B, Tittel SR, Bey A, Freiberg C, Klinkert C, Kordonouri O, Thiele-Schmitz S, Schröder C, Steigleder-Schweiger C, and Holl RWLancet Diabetes Endocrinol2023;

However, the effect of CGM use on the events of severe hypoglycemia (SH) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains unclear. This study determined whether the rates of SH and DKA are lower with use of CGM compared with blood glucose monitoring in young patients with T1D and investigated which CGM metrics are informative for these acute diabetes complications.MethodsA population-based cohort study including patients with T1D younger than 25 years with disease duration of > 1 year who were identified from diabetes centers (n = 511) between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2021, across Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland participated in the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up initiative. SH and DKA rates during the most recent treatment year were examined in people using CGM and in those using blood glucose monitoring. Adjustments of the statistical models included age, sex, diabetes duration, migration background, mode of insulin therapy (pump or injections), and treatment period. The rates of SH and DKA were evaluated by several CGM metrics, including percentage of time below target glucose range (< 3.9 mmol/L), glycemic variability (measured as the coefficient of variation), and mean sensor glucose.ResultsThe cohort included 32,117 patients (53.1% males) with T1D (median age 16.8 years [IQR, 13.3–18.1]). Of these participants, 10,883 used CGM (median 289 days/year), and 21,234 used blood glucose monitoring. Compared with those using blood glucose monitoring, patients using CGM had lower rates of SH (6.74 [95% CI, 5.90–7.69] per 100 patient-years vs 8.84 [95% CI, 8.09–9.66] per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.76 [95% CI, 0.64–0.91]; P = 0.0017) and DKA (3.72 [95% CI, 3.32–4.18] per 100 patient-years vs 7.29 [95% CI, 6.83–7.78] per 100 patient-years; IRR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.44–0.59]; P < 0.0001). The SH rates increased with percentage of time below target glucose range (IRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.18–2.43], P = 0.0024, for 4.0%–7.9% vs < 4.0%; and IRR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.51–3.76], P < 0.0001, for ≥ 8.0% vs < 4.0%) and glycemic variability (coefficient of variation ≥ 36% vs < 36%; IRR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.06–2.17], P = 0.022). The DKA rates increased with mean sensor glucose (IRR, 1.77 [95% CI, 0.89–3.51], P = 0.13, for 8.3–9.9 mmol/L vs < 8.3 mmol/L; IRR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.83–6.93], P < 0.0001, for 10.0–11.6 mmol/L vs < 8.3 mmol/L; and IRR, 8.66 [95% CI, 4.48–16.75], P < 0.0001, for ≥ 11.7 mmol/L vs < 8.3 mmol/L).ConclusionsYoung patients with T1D using CGM might have lower risks of SH and DKA than those using blood glucose monitoring. The CGM metrics associated with lower rates of SH and of DKA might serve as additional tools to advance personalized treatment in young patients with T1D.CommentsIn this population-based cohort study from the large international registry covering an estimated proportion of more than 90% of all individuals with diabetes in the represented region, Beate and colleagues reported evidence of lower rates of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic coma with seizures, and lower rates of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe ketoacidosis in individuals with T1D using CGM compared with those using only blood glucose monitoring (1). These results complement the observations from two previous smaller cohorts from the same registry of individuals with T1D demonstrating reduced rates of acute complications after CGM initiation (2,3).Importantly, the individuals using CGM, compared with the blood glucose monitoring users, had nearly half the incidence of the most severe acute complications of T1D—hypoglycemic coma and severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Possibly, CGM might reduce both the occurrence of acute complications and their progression to severe life-threatening forms. This observed benefit might be attributed to the real-time glucose monitoring and alerting capabilities of CGM, which enable timely intervention and the implementation of counteractive measures (4,5).A single episode of diabetic ketoacidosis can be associated with cognitive dysfunction, particularly in children with T1D, which further emphasizes the criticality of all possible preventive measures (6,7). Additionally, with the large number of available CGM profiles, a study has identified a number of CGM metrics (time below target glucose range [≥ 4%] and higher glucose variability [coefficient of variation ≥ 36%]) as risk factors for severe hypoglycemia, consistent with current recommended targets (8). These data also present an excellent opportunity for calculating the immediate cost savings related to the decrease of acute complications and the resultant decrease in emergency department visits and hospitalizations.CGM Metrics Identify Dysglycemic States in Participants from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention StudyWilson DM1, Pietropaolo SL2, Acevedo-Calado M2, Huang S3, Anyaiwe D4, Scheinker D1, Steck AK5, Vasudevan MM2, McKay SV2,6, Sherr JL7, Herold KC8, Dunne JL9, Greenbaum CJ10, Lord SM10, Haller MJ11, Schatz DA11, Atkinson MA11, Nelson PW4, Pietropaolo M2, and the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group1Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 2Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Diabetes Research Center, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 3Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 4Department of Mathematics & Computer Science, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 5Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 6Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 7Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 8Departments of Immunobiology and Internal Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 9JDRF, New York, NY; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 10Center for Interventional Immunology and Diabetes Program, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA; University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; 11Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida Diabetes Institute, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FLDiabetes Care 2023;46:526–534This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.Because continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) parameters may identify individuals at risk for progression to overt type 1 diabetes (T1D), this study examined whether CGM metrics could provide additional insight into the progression to clinical stage 3 T1D.MethodsFrom the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study, 105 relatives of individuals in T1D probands (median age 16.8 years; 89% non-Hispanic White; 43.8% female) underwent 7-day CGM assessments and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) at 6-month intervals. The three groups evaluated were individuals with (1) stage 2 T1D (n = 42) with two or more diabetes-related autoantibodies and abnormal OGTT; (2) stage 1 T1D (n = 53) with two or more diabetes-related autoantibodies and normal OGTT; and (3) negative test for all diabetes-related autoantibodies and normal OGTT (n = 10).ResultsAfter the baseline data assessment, multiple CGM metrics were found to be associated with progression to stage 3 T1D: spending ≥ 5% time with glucose levels ≥ 140 mg/dL (P = 0.01), ≥ 8% time with glucose levels ≥ 140 mg/dL (P = 0.02), ≥ 5% time with glucose levels ≥ 160 mg/dL (P = 0.0001), and ≥ 8% time with glucose levels ≥ 160 mg/dL (P = 0.02). The stage 2 participants and those who progressed to stage 3 also exhibited higher mean daytime glucose values; they spent more time with glucose values over 120, 140, and 160 mg/dL, and they had greater variability.ConclusionsCGM could aid in the identification of individuals, including those with a normal OGTT, who are likely to rapidly progress to stage 3 T1D.CommentsThis prospective investigation derived from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study, involved 105 first-degree or second-degree relatives of individuals with already diagnosed T1D. Almost one-third (30.5%, n = 29) of the multiple islet autoantibody-positive participants progressed to stage 3 T1D in a median of approximately 1.5 years. The analysis of CGM data worn at baseline revealed that individuals who progressed to clinical T1D spent a significantly greater proportion of their time above 140 mg/dL compared with those who did not progress (8% vs 4.7%). In addition, several other CGM metrics indicative of hyperglycemia (daytime mean glucose, time above 120 or 160 mg/dL) or glycemic variability were associated with progression to stage 3 T1D. Spending more than 5% time above 140 mg/dL emerged as a strong predictor of progression to stage 3 T1D (40% progressed to stage 3 T1D compared with 6.5% of participants with time above 140 mg/dL < 5%).These observations are consistent with findings from the ASK Study, involving autoantibody-positive children identified through general population screening (9) and reviewed in the 2022 ATTD Yearbook (10). It has been previously demonstrated that disruptions of glucose homeostasis precede by several months or even years the progression to clinical stage 3 T1D. This gap provides a crucial window of opportunity for early recognition and management of T1D, which might help avoid diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, this insight could impact decision-making for ongoing and future T1D prevention trials to preserve β-cell insulin secretion (11–15).Overall, these findings suggest that CGM metrics could be useful as indicators of progression to stage 3 T1D, spanning both pediatric and adult populations, and including also individuals with a normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Moreover, CGM-derived criteria should be broadly accepted classifiers of risk when available and could be superior to the OGTT approach of detecting dysglycemia, especially as its use might be more feasible and less burdensome.Intermittently Scanned Continuous Glucose Monitoring for Type 1 DiabetesLeelarathna L1,2, Evans ML6, Neupane S7, Rayman G8, Lumley S9, Cranston I10, Narendran P11, Barnard-Kelly K12, Sutton CJ3,5, Elliott RA4, Taxiarchi VP3, Gkountouras G4, Burns M5, Mubita W1, Kanumilli N1, Camm M1, Thabit H1,2, Wilmot EG13,14 for the FLASH-UK Trial Study Group1Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism Centre, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK; Nottingham, UK; 2Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Gastroenterology, Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, Manchester, UK; Nottingham, UK; 3Centre for Biostatistics, Division of Population Health, Health Service Research and Primary Care, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Nottingham, UK; 4Manchester Centre for Health Economics, Division of Population Health, Health Service Research and Primary Care, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Nottingham, UK; 5Manchester Clinical Trials Unit, Division of Population Health, Health Service Research and Primary Care, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; Nottingham, UK; 6Wellcome Trust–Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge University Hospitals and University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Nottingham, UK; 7Elsie Bertram Diabetes Centre, Norfolk, UK; Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Norwich, UK; Nottingham, UK; 8Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Ipswich Hospital, East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Ipswich, UK; Nottingham, UK; 9Adam Practice, Upton and Poole, Dorset, UK; Nottingham, UK; 10Academic Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Queen Alexandra Hospital, Cosham, Portsmouth, UK; Nottingham, UK; 11Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK; Nottingham, UK; 12Barnard Health, Barnard Health Research Limited, Portsmouth, UK, Nottingham, UK; 13University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Derby Hospital, Derby, UK; Nottingham, UK; 14University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UKN Engl J Med 2022;387:1477–1487This study examined the benefits of intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitors (isCGM) with optional alarms for high and low blood glucose levels in persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.MethodsThis parallel-group, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving participants with T1D and HbA1c levels between 7.5% and 11.0% investigated the efficacy of isCGM as compared with participant monitoring of blood glucose levels via fingerstick testing. The primary outcome was the HbA1c level at 24 weeks, analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Key secondary outcomes included sensor data, participant-reported outcome measures, and safety.ResultsA total of 156 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to using isCGM (intervention group, n = 78) or monitoring their own blood glucose levels with fingerstick testing (usual-care group, n = 78). At baseline, the mean age of the participants was 44 (± 15 SD) years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 21 (± 13 SD) years; 44% of the participants were women. The mean baseline HbA1c levels were 8.7% ± 0.9% in the intervention group and 8.5 ± 0.8% in the usual-care group; at 24 weeks these levels decreased to 7.9% ± 0.8% and 8.3% ± 0.9%, respectively (adjusted mean between-group difference, −0.5 percentage points [95% CI, −0.7 to −0.3], P < 0.001). The time per day that the glucose level was in the target range was 9.0 percentage points (95% CI, 4.7–13.3) higher or 130 minutes (95% CI, 68–192) longer in the intervention group compared with the usual-care group; and the time spent in a hypoglycemic state (blood glucose level, < 70 mg/dL [< 3.9 mmol/L]) was 3.0 percentage points (95% CI, 1.4–4.5) lower or 43 minutes (95% CI, 20–65) shorter in the intervention group. Two participants in the usual-care group had an episode of severe hypoglycemia, and one participant in the intervention group had a skin reaction to the sensor.ConclusionsThe use of isCGM with optional alarms for high and low blood glucose levels resulted in significantly lower HbA1c levels in individuals with T1D compared with monitoring by fingerstick testing.CommentsIn the FLASH-UK trial, Leelarathna and colleagues demonstrated that a second-generation intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitor (isCGM) improved glycemic outcomes in individuals with T1D, particularly among those initially presenting with higher baseline levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Although the absolute HbA1c and time in range levels were outside recommended clinical targets (8,16), the use of isCGM resulted in a clinically significant reduction in HbA1c levels of 0.5%. This improvement in HbA1c was paralleled by improvements in time in range (9%), along with notable reductions in both the time spent above range (6%) and below range (3%).It is pertinent to acknowledge that the first-generation isCGM devices focused mainly on hypoglycemia prevention and often did not lead to notable improvements in HbA1c (17–19); the evolution to the second generation brought forth a significant advancement. The addition of personalized optional alarms for both high and low glucose levels made important progress toward insulin therapy intensification, given the alarms can prompt action to treat glucose excursions. A direct comparison between the first- and second-generation isCGM is lacking, but it can be speculated that second-generation isCGM is closer in functionality to real-time CGM. This is supported by the 0.5% improvement in HbA1c observed in this study, which aligns reasonably well with the outcomes of clinical trials evaluating real-time CGM (20–22). To approach HbA1c and time-in-range clinical targets even closer and enable broader availability of glucose-responsive insulin delivery, a third generation of (is)CGM may also be necessary.Multicenter Randomized Trial of Intermittently Scanned Continuous Glucose Monitoring versus Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes and Recent-onset Acute Myocardial Infarction: Results of the LIBERATES TrialAjjan RA1, Heller SR2, Everett CC3, Vargas-Palacios A4, Higham R2, Sharples L5, Gorog DA6,7, Rogers A8, Reynolds C1, Fernandez C2, Rodrigues P4, Sathyapalan T9, Storey RF10, Stocken DD31Clinical Population and Sciences Department, Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 2Department of Oncology and Metabolism, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 3Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 4Academic Unit of Health Economics, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 5Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 6School of Life and Medical Science, University of Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 7National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 8Patient representative; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 9Academic Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Allam Diabetes Centre, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, UK; Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; 10Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UKDiabetes Care 2023;46:441–449This study analyzed glycemic and patient-related outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and recent myocardial infarction (MI) using modern glucose-monitoring strategies and assessed their cost effectiveness.MethodsLIBERATES was a phase 2, multicenter, two-arm, randomized trial to compare self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM), also known as flash CGM, in individuals with T2D and recent MI who had been treated with insulin and/or a sulphonylurea before hospital admission. The primary outcome measure was time in range (TIR) (glucose 3.9–10.0 mmol/L/day) on days 76–90 after randomization. The secondary and exploratory outcomes included time in hypoglycemia, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), clinical outcome, quality of life (QOL), and cost effectiveness.ResultsThe study randomly assigned 141 participants (median age 63 years [IQR, 53–70]; 73% men) to treatment with isCGm (n = 69) or SMBG (n = 72). The isCGM group had increased TIR by 17 min/day (95% credible interval, −105 to + 153 min/day), with 59% probability of benefit. Users of isCGM also showed lower hypoglycemic exposure (< 3.9 mmol/L) at days 76–90 (−80 min/day; 95% CI, −118 to −43) and days 16–30 (−28 min/day; 95% CI, −92 to 2). Compared with baseline, HbA1c levels showed similar reductions of 7 mmol/mol at 3 months in both study arms. Combined glycemic emergencies and mortality occurred in 4 isCGM and 7 SMBG study participants. QOL measures marginally favored isCGM, and the intervention proved to be cost effective.ConclusionsCompared with SMBG, isCGM in individuals with T2D and MI marginally increased TIR and significantly reduced hypoglycemic exposure while equally improving HbA1c levels, explaining its cost effectiveness.CommentsEight years ago, a retrospective cohort analysis using the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink of more than 100,000 individuals with newly diagnosed T2D concluded that a 1-year delay in treatment intensification for people with HbA1c above 7.5% was associated with an estimated 67% increased risk of myocardial infarction, a 51% increase in risk of stroke, and a 64% increased risk of heart f ","This review article discusses the role of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in diabetes management, highlighting key studies that demonstrate its benefits in reducing severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes, and improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes."

This is particularly crucial for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who require long-term self-management. However, with extensive glycemic variability, developing a prediction algorithm applicable across diverse populations remains a significant challenge. Leveraging meta-learning for domain generalization, we propose GPFormer, a Transformer-based zero-shot learning method designed for multi-horizon glucose prediction. We developed GPFormer on the REPLACE-BG dataset, comprising 226 participants with T1D, and proceeded to evaluate its performance using three external clinical datasets with CGM data. These included the OhioT1DM dataset, a publicly available dataset including 12 T1D participants, as well as two proprietary datasets. The first proprietary dataset included 22 participants, while the second contained 45 participants, encompassing a diverse group with T1D, type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes, including patients admitted to hospitals. These four datasets include both outpatient and inpatient settings, various intervention strategies, and demographic variability, which effectively reflect real-world scenarios of CGM usage. When compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods, GPFormer consistently demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest root mean square error for all the evaluated datasets up to a prediction horizon of two hours. These experimental results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed model across a variety of populations, demonstrating its substantial potential to enhance glucose management in a wide range of practical clinical settings.

Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population. ","This study proposes a multimodal deep learning architecture that integrates continuous glucose monitoring data with physiological context from health records to predict interstitial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients with high accuracy (up to 96.7%) and low error (MAPE 6-26 mg/dL)."

Anders Lyngvi Fougner","10.1089/dia.2025.0074","","Background: The root mean squared error (RMSE) is commonly used to evaluate blood glucose prediction algorithms. However, it primarily measures how well predictions align with the most likely future values, rather than supporting optimal and proactive treatment decisions. Since diabetes management data predominantly features blood glucose values within the target range, RMSE tends to favor models that consistently predict target-range values, often at the expense of detecting clinically critical events such as rapid fluctuations, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia. This study examines how and why RMSE biases evaluations toward trivial models, highlighting the need for alternative performance criteria that better reflect clinical priorities. Methods: We developed the composite glucose prediction metric (CGPM) to integrate three components: RMSE, temporal gain and geometric mean (glycemic event prediction). A custom loss function was designed to emphasize clinically critical predictions during model training. Pareto frontier analysis was used to assess trade-offs among models with comparable performance. Results: CGPM was computed for five blood glucose prediction techniques (zero-order hold, naïve linear regression, ridge regression, ridge regression trained with a custom loss function, and a physiology-based model) applied to the OhioT1DM dataset. The data-driven model with the lowest RMSE performed poorly on glycemic event prediction, highlighting RMSE's bias toward target-range predictions. In contrast, the ridge regressor trained with the custom loss function improved event prediction, showing that clinically weighted optimization mitigates biases. Conclusions: Blood glucose prediction algorithms require evaluation and optimization criteria beyond accuracy to better support optimal treatment decisions. This study introduced the CGPM as an alternative evaluation framework, along with a loss function designed for model optimization that emphasizes clinically critical but rare events. Further clinical validation is needed to refine these criteria and ensure they align more closely with the needs of diabetes management. ","Current blood glucose prediction algorithms are biased toward accuracy over clinically relevant performance, prioritizing target-range predictions over critical events like hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, necessitating alternative evaluation criteria and optimization methods."

By contrast, periodically updated medical records and especially the use of real-time health-sensing devices provide accurate tracking of health and disease over time. The technological trend toward enabling consumer electronics with capabilities for sensing physiological signals, such as motion, heart rate, or blood sugar levels, is creating a vast data space. If properly processed, these real-time data can fundamentally change research paradigms and transform the clinical practice.However, more data are not always better. With the increased data volume and complexity, the challenge becomes how to extract information relevant to the condition of a particular patient at a particular time. The classic pathway of medical logic of data → information → decision becomes difficult to follow with the traditional methods of biostatistics. New approaches are needed and are fortunately available, ranging from modeling, simulation, and optimal control methods, to rapidly developing data science tools.Before continuing further, we should emphasize that, arguably, diabetes mellitus is the best quantified human condition. In the past 40 years, metabolic monitoring technologies have progressed from occasional assessment of average glycemia via glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), to blood glucose monitoring a few times a day, to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) producing data points every few minutes—time series tracking the dynamics of the metabolic system. The high temporal resolution of CGM data has enabled advanced treatments such as decision support assisting insulin injection or oral medication, or automated closed-loop control known as the ""artificial pancreas."" Sophisticated metabolic models and simulators are available as well.In this article, we review the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We structured the results of this review in three sections: (1) closed-loop control, or automated insulin delivery (AID), which appears to be the term preferred recently; (2) decision-support systems (DSS), particularly those that use contemporary methods such as artificial intelligence, and (3) data acquisition, engineering, analytics, and visualization, which are all data science tools increasingly applied to the retrieval of electronic medical records (EMR) and real-time disease-tracking information.Key Articles ReviewedConsensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M, Nimri R, Bergenstal RM, Barnard-Kelly K, Danne T, Hovorka R, Kovatchev BP, Messer LH, Parkin CG, Ambler-Osborn L, Amiel SA, Bally L, Beck RW, Biester S, Biester T, Blanchette JE, Bosi E, Boughton CK, Breton MD, Brown SA, Buckingham BA, Cai A, Carlson AL, Castle JR, Choudhary P, Close KL, Cobelli C, Criego AB, Davis E, de Beaufort C, de Bock MI, DeSalvo DJ, DeVries JH, Dovc K, Doyle FJ 3rd, Ekhlaspour L, Shvalb NF, Forlenza GP, Gallen G, Garg SK, Gershenoff DC, Gonder-Frederick LA, Haidar A, Hartnell S, Heinemann L, Heller S, Hirsch IB, Hood KK, Isaacs D, Klonoff DC, Kordonouri O, Kowalski A, Laffel L, Lawton J, Lal RA, Leelarathna L, Maahs DM, Murphy HR, Nørgaard K, O'Neal D, Oser S, Oser T, Renard E, Riddell MC, Rodbard D, Russell SJ, Schatz DA, Shah VN, Sherr JL, Simonson GD, Wadwa RP, Ward C, Weinzimer SA, Wilmot EG, Battelino TEndoc Rev2023;

8:e47592Closed-Loop Control of Diabetes, or AIDA PubMed search on artificial pancreas, or AID, or closed loop in diabetes identified 397 results for the period of July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. From these, we selected 40 articles of interest (e.g., ∼10%) for inclusion in the reference list of this article. Five of these articles are reviewed in more detail in the following pages (1–5). It is worth noting that four of them are published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine (impact factor, 176.082) (2–5) and signify substantial clinical trials by different research groups. Publication of these studies in such high-ranking journals was rare until recently, and we believe the AID literature this past year has achieved a new record in terms of its impact on medical science.A number of other notable studies were published as well (6–15) that tested various AID systems in diverse conditions, such as the inpatient setting (7), with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (9,10), with long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D) with hypoglycemia unawareness (12), or in very young children (14). The large randomized trials (> 100 participants) used traditional designs to reconfirm the advantages of hybrid closed loop over conventional therapy (6,15). Meta-analyses (16–18) and comprehensive reviews (19–23) solidified AID as an advanced, effective, and cost-effective (24) treatment of T1D and T2D. International consortiums published clinical guidelines for the use of AID in the clinical practice (1,25–27). And several studies reported real-life data for various AID systems (28–35), with one study reporting data for nearly 20,000 AID users (28).The investigation of using ultra-rapid-acting insulin has continued with clinical trials comparing faster insulin aspart with standard insulin aspart (36–38) and yielding mixed results—in some studies no effect was shown (36), in others ultra-rapid insulin contributed to better control (38). A new study using a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor in addition to insulin in people with T1D confirmed previous results and found that ""empagliflozin at 2.5 and 5 mg increased time in range during hybrid closed-loop therapy by 11–13 percentage points compared with placebo in those who otherwise were unable to attain glycemic targets"" (39). And last, but not least, a study on AID performance during swimming was published, which also presents interesting data about the interdevice (sensor–pump) communication in water (40).Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Automated Insulin Delivery Technologies in Clinical PracticePhillip M1,2*, Nimri R1,2*, Bergenstal RM3, Barnard-Kelly K4, Danne T5, Hovorka R6, Kovatchev BP7, Messer LH8, Parkin CG9, Ambler-Osborn L10, Amiel SA11, Bally L12, Beck RW13, Biester S5, Biester T5, Blanchette JE14,15, Bosi E16, Boughton CK17, Breton MD7, Brown SA7,18, Buckingham BA19, Cai A20, Carlson AL3, Castle JR21, Choudhary P22, Close KL20, Cobelli C23, Criego AB3, Davis E24, de Beaufort C25, de Bock MI26, DeSalvo DJ27, DeVries JH28, Dovc K29, Doyle FJ 3rd30, Ekhlaspour L31, Shvalb NF1, Forlenza GP8, Gallen G11, Garg SK8, Gershenoff DC3, Gonder-Frederick LA7, Haidar A32, Hartnell S33, Heinemann L34, Heller S35, Hirsch IB36, Hood KK37, Isaacs D38, Klonoff DC39, Kordonouri O5, Kowalski A40, Laffel L10, Lawton J41, Lal RA42, Leelarathna L43, Maahs DM19, Murphy HR44, Nørgaard K45, O'Neal D46, Oser S47, Oser T47, Renard E48, Riddell MC49, Rodbard D50, Russell SJ51, Schatz DA52, Shah VN8, Sherr JL53, Simonson GD3, Wadwa RP8, Ward C54, Weinzimer SA53, Wilmot EG55,56, Battelino T29*Contributed equally to the manuscript and are both corresponding authors 1The Jesse Z and Sara Lea Shafer Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, National Center for Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel; 2Sacker Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel; 3International Diabetes Center, HealthPartners Institute, Minneapolis, MN; 4Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK; 5AUF DER BULT, Diabetes-Center for Children and Adolescents, Endocrinology and General Paediatrics, Hannover, Germany; 6Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; 7Center for Diabetes Technology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 8Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver—Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 9CGParkin Communications, Inc., Henderson, NV; 10Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; 11Department of Diabetes, King's College London, London, UK; 12Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 13Jaeb Center for Health Research Foundation, Inc., Tampa, FL; 14College of Nursing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; 15Center for Diabetes and Obesity, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; 16Diabetes Research Institute, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital and San Raffaele Vita Salute University, Milan, Italy; 17Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Cambridge, UK; 18Division of Endocrinology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; 19Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 20The diaTribe Foundation/Close Concerns, San Diego, CA; 21Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; 22Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK; 23Department of Woman and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; 24Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Australia; 25Diabetes & Endocrine Care Clinique Pédiatrique DECCP/Centre Hospitalier Luxembourg, and Faculty of Sciences, Technology and Medicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzette, GD Luxembourg/Department of Paediatrics, UZ-VUB, Brussels, Belgium; 26Department of Paediatrics, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand; 27Division of Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX ; 28Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Internal Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; 29Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, UMC - University Children's Hospital, Ljubljana, Slovenia, and Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; 30Harvard John A.

Numerous randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have shown that the use of AID systems is safe and effective in helping individuals with diabetes achieve long-term glycemic goals while reducing hypoglycemia risk. AID systems have thus become an integral part of diabetes management, but recommendations for using AID systems in clinical settings have been lacking.MethodsIn 2021, an international panel of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in AID was organized by the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress to develop clinical guidelines for initiating AID for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The nine working groups addressed evolution of AID, clinical evidence, determining the target population for AID use, initiation of AID, education and training, utilization of AID, AID data reporting, psychological issues/user perspective, and the future of AID. The full panel voted on the working group recommendations, which became the basis of the consensus recommendations.ResultsThe report provides needed guidance to clinicians who are interested in using AID and (2) serves as a comprehensive review of evidence for payers to consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage.ConclusionsGuided recommendations are critical for AID success and acceptance, and all clinicians who treat diabetes need to become familiar with the available systems to eliminate disparities in diabetes quality of care. A comprehensive listing of the evidence payers should consider when determining eligibility criteria for AID insurance coverage is also provided.CommentsThese consensus recommendations published in Endocrine Reviews present the collective opinion of a select group of experts in AID (aka closed-loop control of diabetes) regarding the use of AID systems in clinical practice. This article is a highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to be introduced to the current technological and clinical state of AID systems, with a peek into their future as well.Following a review of the closed-loop field and an account of the evidence-based advantages of AID systems over other T1D therapies, the guidelines continue with sections explaining the different types of AID algorithms and the difference between hybrid and fully automated AID systems (HCL and FCL), the latter being defined as an AID system that does not require user involvement to function.The following are major takeaways from these consensus recommendations. (1) Evidence suggests that AID systems should be considered as a treatment option for all people with T1D to improve glycemic control, regardless of age, hypoglycemia awareness, pregnancy, or certain comorbidities. (2) To date, all clinically available systems are ""hybrid,"" meaning they require specific diabetes managements skills such as carbohydrate counting, so training and support for users and health-care providers are essential. (3) Interoperability between system components (e.g., sensors, algorithms, and insulin pumps) is important for the proliferation of these new technologies, but to a large extent this depends on the industry. (4) Early initiation of diabetes technologies in newly diagnosed T1D has been shown to improve and sustain long-term glycemic control, so early AID system initiation is encouraged. (5) The transition to an AID system should be individualized, and the initial settings of an AID system should be selected according to personal glycemic targets, based on recently acquired continuous glucose monitor (CGM) metrics. (6) Unified reporting of AID data is suggested, using clinically important glucose (e.g., time-in-range) and insulin (e.g., total daily insulin) metrics, plus the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) usually aggregated over 14 days, which has become a standardized way to visualize CGM data. (7) Psychological issues related to the use of AID systems should be discussed and documented in the context of discontinuation or noncompliance with AID treatment.In conclusion, the consensus recommendations map future directions for AID development, including FCL, use of data science methods to analyze and comprehend the vast amounts of CGM and insulin-delivery data collected by AID systems, and learning adaptive AID algorithms that continually tailor the treatment to the changing behavior and physiology of their users. The consensus strongly recommends that all payers (government and private) should reimburse for AID systems as well as for AID education and training to support the management of people with T1D.Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery in Type 1 DiabetesBurnside MJ1,3, Lewis DM11, Crocket HR4, Meier RA1, Williman JA2, Sanders OJ1,3, Jefferies CA6,7, Faherty AM6, Paul RG5, Lever CS5, Price SKJ5, Frewen CM8, Jones SD8, Gunn TC10, Lampey C6, Wheeler BJ8,9, de Bock MI1,31Departments of Pediatrics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 2Department of Population Health, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 3Department of Pediatrics, Canterbury District Health Board Christchurch, New Zealand; 4Te Huataki Waiora School of Health, Sport and Human Performance, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; 5Waikato Regional Diabetes Service, Waikato District Health Board, Hamilton, New Zealand; 6Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Starship Children's Health, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; 7Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 8Department of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; 9Pediatric Department, Southern District Health Board, Dunedin, New Zealand; 10Nightscout New Zealand, Hamilton, New Zealand; 11OpenAPS, Seattle, WAN Engl J Med 2022;387:869–881This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) use open-source automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, and more data are needed on the efficacy and safety of these system.MethodsIn this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, patients with T1D were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use an open-source AID system or a sensor-augmented insulin pump (control). The participants included both children (defined as 7–15 years of age) and adults (defined as 16–70 years of age). A modified version of AndroidAPS 2.8 (with a standard OpenAPS 0.7.0 algorithm) paired with a preproduction DANA-i insulin pump and Dexcom G6 CGM, which has an Android smartphone application as the user interface, was used as the AID system. The primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target glucose range of 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) between days 155 and 168, the final 2 weeks of the trial.ResultsA total of 97 patients (48 children and 49 adults) underwent randomization, 44 to open-source AID and 53 to the control group. At 24 weeks, the mean time in the target range increased from 61.2% ± 12.3% SD to 71.2% ± 12.1% SD in the AID group and decreased from 57.7% ± 14.3% SD to 54.5% ± 16.0% SD in the control group (adjusted difference, 14 percentage points [95% CI, 9.2–18.8], P < 0.001), with no treatment effect according to age (P = 0.56). Participants in the AID group spent 3 hours and 21 minutes more in the target range per day compared with in the control group. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in either group. Two patients in the AID group withdrew from the trial owing to connectivity issues.ConclusionsThe use of an open-source AID system in children and adults with T1D resulted in a significantly higher percentage of time in the target glucose range compared with the use of a sensor-augmented insulin pump.CommentsOpen-source AID (or Do-it-yourself Loop) algorithms have been available since before commercial AID systems appeared on the market. Typically, the handling of these open-source algorithms required above-average engineering and computer skills. The lack of clinical trials of open-source AID was also a reason these systems to remain unregulated (i.e., not formally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] or other regulatory agencies). This article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine aims to counter these shortcomings by presenting a randomized-controlled trial of one open-source algorithm running on a smartphone.The trial achieved results that are very similar to those in trials published to date for commercial AID systems: for instance, a 14-percentage-point increase in time in range up to 71%, a reduction of HbA1c of 0.5 percentage points, and a relatively low risk for hypoglycemia. The editorial that accompanied the article labeled the trial a ""path toward expanding treatment options for diabetes"" (41). As expected there were opposing opinions that emphasized the lack of regulatory approval of open-source AID: ""Unapproved products and algorithms raise the undesirable prospect of clinical harm and litigation"" (42). After the publication of this article, the latter argument became less critical owing to the FDA approval in January 2023 of Tidepool Loop—an FDA-regulated version of Loop, to be available in the iOS App Store, which is intended to work with commercially available insulin pumps and CGMs.This ATTD Yearbook article takes a neutral view on the open-source AID controversy: evidence has shown that these systems are not superior to commercial devices, and their more flexible customization features do not necessarily result in improved glycemic control. However, as noted in the previously mentioned editorial (41), open-source AID offers one more path toward expanding the treatment options for insulin-requiring diabetes, which can be appealing to a perhaps select group of people who are confident in their diabetes-management skills.Trial of Hybrid Closed-Loop Control in Young Children with Type 1 DiabetesWadwa RP1, Reed ZW2, Buckingham BA3, DeBoer MD5, Ekhlaspour L4, Forlenza GP1, Schoelwer M5, Lum J2, Kollman C2, Beck RW2, Breton MD5, for the PEDAP Trial Study Group1Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; 2Jaeb Center for Health Research, Tampa, FL; 3Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 4Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, University of California, San Francisco, CA; 5University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology, Charlottesville, VAN Engl J Med 2023;388:991–1001This study is also discussed in DIA-2024-2508, page S-117.Closed-loop control systems of insulin delivery may improve glycemic outcomes in young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the efficacy and safety of initiating a closed-loop s ","This article reviews the progress of data technologies for diabetes from July 2022 to June 2023, focusing on closed-loop control, artificial intelligence-based decision-support systems, and data science.

Methods: Observational study using Dexcom CGM device data linked with patients' electronic health records from 2015-2020 to identify temporal and regional patterns of glycemic control. Results: Using a cohort of 785 T1D and 1,466 T2D patients and their 1,551,644 CGM readings over nearly 3-years, we found that glycemic control deteriorated significantly during weekends. Average glucose differed between Sundays (highest) and Wednesdays (lowest) by 2.7mg/dL (Figure). Additionally, time-in-range (between 70 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL) and time-above-range (time above 180 mg/dL) showed similar temporal patterns. We also observed seasonal variations in glycemic trends, with patients having worse glycemic control from October to February and better control from April to August. The average glucose difference between April (lowest) and December (highest) was 4mg/dL and varied regionally, with these patterns accentuated in the Northeast compared to the Southwest. These patterns were generally similar in both T1D and T2D patients. Conclusions: Identifying and understanding these real-world glucose fluctuations may help patients and providers better manage overall glucose control. Disclosure T. Okuno: None. L. Sort: None. S.

A key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the postprandial Area Under the Curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance based on a person’s lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could allow an individual to adjust their behavioral choices accordingly to maintain normal glucose levels. In this work, we develop an explainable machine learning solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and utilizes advanced data processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to estimate postprandial AUC and predict hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and recent glucose patterns. We use data obtained using wearables in a five-week clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data, and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose patterns. GlucoLens achieves a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology provides a 16% better predictive performance compared to the comparison models. Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 79% and an F1 score of 0.749 and recommends different treatment options to help avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations. With systematic experiments and discussion supported by established prior research, we show that our method is generalizable and consistent with clinical understanding.

Among the different types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, caused by a lack of insulin secretion, is particularly challenging to treat. In this regard, automatic glucose level estimation implements Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices, showing positive therapeutic outcomes. AI-based glucose prediction has commonly followed a deterministic approach, usually with a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these AI-based methods do not provide enough information in critical decision-making scenarios, like in the medical field. This work intends to provide accurate, interpretable, and personalized glucose prediction using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and also includes an uncertainty estimation. The TFT was trained using two databases, an in-house-collected dataset and the OhioT1DM dataset, commonly used for glucose forecasting benchmarking. For both datasets, the set of input features to train the model was varied to assess their impact on model interpretability and prediction performance. Models were evaluated using common prediction metrics, diabetes-specific metrics, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability of the model, including feature importance and attention. The obtained results showed that TFT outperforms existing methods in terms of RMSE by at least 13% for both datasets.

Tommerdahl","10.2337/dci25-0015","","In type 1 diabetes, a condition that necessitates lifelong exogenous insulin replacement, there is heavy reliance on technology-assisted insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. Yet, people living with type 1 diabetes still face dysglycemia, weight gain, vascular complications, ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia, and psychological distress. Cardiovascular and kidney disease remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, yet traditional risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hyperglycemia) incompletely explain this excess burden. Emerging evidence highlights the role of insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction exacerbated by current subcutaneous insulin therapies in type 1 diabetes, independent of overweight/obesity status. This has fueled interest in addressing metabolic challenges in type 1 diabetes through novel insulin analogs, adjunctive noninsulin therapies, and integrated technologies. Our review explores the potential synergy between technologies and adjunctive therapeutics to address unique physiologic drivers of metabolic dysfunction in type 1 diabetes. Innovations such as multihormonal systems, dynamic glucose and ketone monitoring, and automated insulin titration hold promise. However, leveraging emerging insights from nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies and other drug classes such as insulin-sensitizing agents and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors could pave the way for designing combination type 1 diabetes–specific therapies. Large, placebo-controlled trials are needed to progress the field toward use of combination therapies that reduce metabolic and vascular complications and ease patient burden in type 1 diabetes.
