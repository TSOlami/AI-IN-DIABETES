Dharmendra Singh Rajput","10.7717/peerj-cs.1947","","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual impairment globally. It occurs due to long-term diabetes with fluctuating blood glucose levels. It has become a significant concern for people in the working age group as it can lead to vision loss in the future. Manual examination of fundus images is time-consuming and requires much effort and expertise to determine the severity of the retinopathy. To diagnose and evaluate the disease, deep learning-based technologies have been used, which analyze blood vessels, microaneurysms, exudates, macula, optic discs, and hemorrhages also used for initial detection and grading of DR. This study examines the fundamentals of diabetes, its prevalence, complications, and treatment strategies that use artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and federated learning (FL). The research covers future studies, performance assessments, biomarkers, screening methods, and current datasets. Various neural network designs, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and applications of ML, DL, and FL in the processing of fundus images, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variations, are thoroughly examined. The potential research methods, such as developing DL models and incorporating heterogeneous data sources, are also outlined. Finally, the challenges and future directions of this research are discussed.

In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithms for blood glucose (BG) forecasting in people with type 1 diabetes.


METHODS
We propose stacks of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory units to predict BG level for 30-, 60-, and 90-minute prediction horizon (PH), given historical glucose measurements, meal information, and insulin intakes. The evaluation was performed on two data sets, Replace-BG and DIAdvisor, representative of free-living conditions and in-hospital setting, respectively.


RESULTS
For 90-minute PH, our model obtained mean absolute error of 17.30 ± 2.07 and 18.23 ± 2.97 mg/dL, root mean square error of 23.45 ± 3.18 and 25.12 ± 4.65 mg/dL, coefficient of determination of 84.13 ± 4.22% and 82.34 ± 4.54%, and in terms of the continuous glucose-error grid analysis 94.71 ± 3.89% and 91.71 ± 4.32% accurate predictions, 1.81 ± 1.06% and 2.51 ± 0.86% benign errors, and 3.47 ± 1.12% and 5.78 ± 1.72% erroneous predictions, for Replace-BG and DIAdvisor data sets, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Our investigation demonstrated that our method achieved superior glucose forecasting compared with existing approaches in the literature, and thanks to its generalizability showed potential for real-life applications.","The investigation demonstrated that the proposed stacks of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory units to predict BG level for 30, 60, and 90-minute prediction horizon (PH) achieved superior glucose forecasting compared with existing approaches in the literature, and showed potential for real-life applications."

Hassan Ghasemzadeh","10.1109/bhi58575.2023.10313443","","Effective prevention and management of diabetes relies on maintaining a normal blood glucose level, thus avoiding abnormal events such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Predicting anomalous events beforehand can potentially help patients and caregivers intervene to prevent such events through modifiable behaviors such as exercise, diet, and medication. Although Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) sensors have been used to monitor and forecast blood glucose level, current research lacks a computational approach that recommends a behavioral intervention to bring the glucose level to a normal range. To address this shortcoming, we present GlySim1, a CGM simulator that uses multimodal data to not only forecast future glucose readings but also enable a user to examine the impacts of behavior change on glucose response in advance. GlySim creates opportunities for change in food consumption, medication, and physical activity to avoid dysglycemia by pinpointing factors that cause anomalous events using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and allowing users to observe how adjusting a behavioral factor changes glucose trajectories. We validate GlySim on a dataset of 10 patients with type 1 diabetes and achieve an overall mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 16.5 mg/dl in simulating glycemic response. Furthermore, GlySim detects hyperglycemic events with 0.89 average precision.","GlySim1 is presented, a CGM simulator that uses multimodal data to not only forecast future glucose readings but also enable a user to examine the impacts of behavior change on glucose response in advance and validate GlySim on a dataset of 10 patients with type 1 diabetes."

Design Retrospective analysis of clinical OCT and OCTA scans of control and diabetic patients. Participants The data used for microvasculature segmentation consisted of OCTA en face images acquired from four OCT instruments with a total of 153 images, with fields-of-view ranging from 2×2mm to 6×6mm. The data used for RDR classification consisted of OCTA en face images and structural OCT projections acquired from two commercial OCT systems with a total of 700 images. Methods OCTA images used for microvasculature segmentation were manually delineated and verified by retina experts. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity was evaluated by retinal specialists and condensed into two classes: non-referable DR, and RDR. The federated learning configuration was demonstrated via simulation using four clients for microvasculature segmentation and compared with other collaborative methods. Subsequently, federated learning was applied over multiple institutions for RDR classification, and was compared with models trained and tested on data from the same institution (internal models) and different institutions (external models). Main Outcome Measures:For microvasculature segmentation, we measured the accuracy and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). For severity classification, we measured accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, area under the precision-recall curve, balanced accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of further stratified severities. Results For both applications, federated learning achieved similar performance to internal models. Additionally, for microvasculature segmentation, the federated learning model achieved similar performance (mean DSC across all test sets 0.793) to models trained on a fully-centralized dataset (mean DSC: 0.807). For RDR classification, federated learning achieved an AUROC of 0.944–0.970; the internal models attained an AUROC of 0.945-0.978. Similar results are reflected in the other calculated evaluation metrics. Conclusions Federated learning shows similar results to traditional deep learning in both applications of segmentation and classification, while maintaining data privacy. Evaluation metrics highlight the potential of collaborative learning for increasing domain diversity and the generalizability of models used for the classification of OCT data.","In this paper, the performance of a federated learning framework for deep neural network-based retinal microvasculature segmentation and referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) classification using OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) was evaluated."

We propose a layered meta-learning approach based on multi-expert systems to predict adverse events in T1D. The base learner is composed of three deep neural networks and exploits only continuous glucose monitoring data as an input feature. Each network specializes in predicting whether the patient is about to experience hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia. The output of the experts is passed to a meta-learner to provide the final model classification. In addition, we formally introduce a novel parameter, $\alpha $ , to evaluate the advance by which a prediction is performed. We evaluate the proposed approach on both a public and a private dataset and implement it on an edge device to test its feasibility in real life. On average, on the Ohio T1DM dataset, our system was able to predict hypoglycemia events with a time gain of 22.8 minutes, hyperglycemia ones with an advance of 24.0 minutes. Our model not only outperforms presented models in the literature in terms of events predicted with sufficient advance, but also with regard to the number of false positives, achieving on average 0.45 and 0.46 hypo- and hyperglycemic false alarms per day, respectively. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach effectively improves performance in a new cohort of patients by training only the meta-learner with a limited amount of data. We believe our approach would be an essential ally for the patients to control the glycemic fluctuations and adjust their insulin therapy and dietary intakes, enabling them to speed up decision-making and improve personal self-management, resulting in a reduced risk of acute and chronic complications. As our last contribution, we assessed the validity of the approach by exploiting only blood glucose variations as well as in combination with the information of the insulin boluses, the skin temperature, and the galvanic skin response. In general, we have observed that providing other information but CGM leads to slightly lower performances with respect to considering CGM alone.","In this article , a layered meta-learning approach based on multi-expert systems was proposed to predict adverse events in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) using continuous glucose monitoring data as an input feature."

Machine learning approaches using neural networking and “deep learning” can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons.

 Real-time prediction of blood glucose levels (BGLs) in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) presents considerable challenges. Accordingly, we present a personalized multitasking framework aimed to forecast blood glucose levels in patients. The patient data was initially categorized according to gender and age and subsequently utilized as input for a modified GRU network model, creating five prediction sub-models. The model hyperparameters were optimized and tuned after introducing the decay factor and incorporating the TCN network and attention mechanism into the GRU model. This step was undertaken to improve the capability of feature extraction. The Ohio T1DM clinical dataset was used to train and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Clark Error Grid Analysis (EGA), were used to evaluate the performance. The results showed that the average RMSE and the MAE of the proposed model were 16.896 and 9.978 mg/dL, respectively, over the prediction horizon (PH) of 30 minutes. The average RMSE and the MAE were 28.881 and 19.347 mg/dL, respectively, over the PH of 60 min. The proposed model demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy. In addition, the EGA analysis showed that the proposed model accurately predicted 30-minute and 60-minute PH within zones A and B, demonstrating that the framework is clinically feasible. The proposed personalized multitask prediction model in this study offers robust assistance for clinical decision-making, playing a pivotal role in improving the outcomes of individuals with diabetes.

Here, to bridge the gaps, we developed an integrated image–language system (DeepDR-LLM), combining a large language model (LLM module) and image-based deep learning (DeepDR-Transformer), to provide individualized diabetes management recommendations to PCPs. In a retrospective evaluation, the LLM module demonstrated comparable performance to PCPs and endocrinology residents when tested in English and outperformed PCPs and had comparable performance to endocrinology residents in Chinese. For identifying referable DR, the average PCP’s accuracy was 81.0% unassisted and 92.3% assisted by DeepDR-Transformer. Furthermore, we performed a single-center real-world prospective study, deploying DeepDR-LLM. We compared diabetes management adherence of patients under the unassisted PCP arm ( n = 397) with those under the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm ( n = 372). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm showed better self-management behaviors throughout follow-up ( P &lt; 0.05). For patients with referral DR, those in the PCP+DeepDR-LLM arm were more likely to adhere to DR referrals ( P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, DeepDR-LLM deployment improved the quality and empathy level of management recommendations. Given its multifaceted performance, DeepDR-LLM holds promise as a digital solution for enhancing primary diabetes care and DR screening.

To enhance the robustness of our model, we implement strategies such as data augmentation and the development of advanced group-level feature analysis. A cornerstone of our approach is the implementation of a deep attentive transformer that is sensitive to group characteristics. This framework excels in processing a wide array of data, including clinical and physical examination information, to accurately predict the progression of DM. Beyond its predictive capabilities, our model is engineered to perform advanced feature selection and reasoning. This is crucial for understanding the impact of both individual and group-level factors on deep models’ predictions, providing invaluable insights into the dynamics of DM progression. Our approach not only marks a significant advancement in the prediction of diabetes progression but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing this chronic disease, thereby aiding in more effective diabetes management and research.

A shortage of diabetes specialists, uneven distribution of medical resources, low adherence to medications, and improper self-management contribute to poor glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Recent advancements in digital health technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), provide a significant opportunity to achieve better efficiency in diabetes care, which may diminish the increase in diabetes-related health-care expenditures. Here, we review the recent progress in the application of AI in the management of diabetes and then discuss the opportunities and challenges of AI application in clinical practice. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of combining and expanding upon existing digital health technologies to develop an AI-assisted digital health-care ecosystem that includes the prevention and management of diabetes.

To comprehensively explore the real-world implications of machine learning in diabetes, it is imperative to initiate the publication of an efficient survey article from computer science perspective. A standardized database tailored for systematic reviews has been established, encompassing a substantial collection of 1150 articles.

The results of this research cannot be used for the purpose of meta-analysis. Instead, its suitable to have an insight on general performance of ML models which generally outperform other ML methods. The results indicate the most pupular and effective ML in diabetes research. The findings underscore accuracy as the most reliable and comprehensive yardstick for assessing machine learning techniques across various diabetes applications. Furthermore, artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forests (RF) exhibit exceptional suitability, particularly when juxtaposed against alternative machine learning approaches. The majority of investigations predominantly align with detection or estimation pursuits. Additionally, we advocate for the integration of hybrid machine learning techniques in ongoing diabetes research endeavors.","An enhanced PRISMA-based methodology for reviewing and evaluating the performance of machine learning in diabetes contexts is introduced and artificial neural networks and random forests are indicated as the most pupular and effective ML in diabetes research."
"Layered Meta-Learning Algorithm for Predicting Adverse Events in Type 1 Diabetes","https://scispace.com/paper/layered-meta-learning-algorithm-for-predicting-adverse-2s6qwjuk","2023","Journal Article","IEEE Access","","10.1109/access.2023.3237992","","Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic disease that, if not treated properly, can lead to serious complications. We propose a layered meta-learning approach based on multi-expert systems to predict adverse events in T1D. The base learner is composed of three deep neural networks and exploits only continuous glucose monitoring data as an input feature. Each network specializes in predicting whether the patient is about to experience hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia. The output of the experts is passed to a meta-learner to provide the final model classification. In addition, we formally introduce a novel parameter, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula> , to evaluate the advance by which a prediction is performed. We evaluate the proposed approach on both a public and a private dataset and implement it on an edge device to test its feasibility in real life. On average, on the Ohio T1DM dataset, our system was able to predict hypoglycemia events with a time gain of 22.8 minutes, hyperglycemia ones with an advance of 24.0 minutes. Our model not only outperforms presented models in the literature in terms of events predicted with sufficient advance, but also with regard to the number of false positives, achieving on average 0.45 and 0.46 hypo- and hyperglycemic false alarms per day, respectively. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach effectively improves performance in a new cohort of patients by training only the meta-learner with a limited amount of data. We believe our approach would be an essential ally for the patients to control the glycemic fluctuations and adjust their insulin therapy and dietary intakes, enabling them to speed up decision-making and improve personal self-management, resulting in a reduced risk of acute and chronic complications. As our last contribution, we assessed the validity of the approach by exploiting only blood glucose variations as well as in combination with the information of the insulin boluses, the skin temperature, and the galvanic skin response. In general, we have observed that providing other information but CGM leads to slightly lower performances with respect to considering CGM alone.

The models were trained and tested on continuous glucose monitoring data obtained from 380 subjects with T1D. Two DL algorithms—multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)—as well as two classic ML algorithms, random forest (RF) and gradient boosting trees (GBTs), were applied. The resulting models based on the DL and ML algorithms demonstrated high and similar accuracy in predicting target glucose (F1 metric: 96–98%) and above-target glucose (F1: 93–97%) within a 30 min prediction horizon. Model performance was poorer when predicting low glucose (F1: 80–86%). MLP provided the highest accuracy in low-glucose prediction.

Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. 1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. 2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. 3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.

Screening to detect early sight-threatening lesions of DR can reduce the burden of vision loss; nevertheless, the process requires intensive manual labor and extensive resources to accommodate the increasing number of patients with diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be an effective tool which can potentially lower the burden of screening DR and vision loss. In this article, we review the use of AI for DR screening on color retinal photographs in different phases of application, ranging from development to deployment. Early studies of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms using feature extraction to detect DR achieved a high sensitivity but relatively lower specificity. Robust sensitivity and specificity were achieved with the application of deep learning (DL), although ML is still used in some tasks. Public datasets were utilized in retrospective validations of the developmental phases in most algorithms, which require a large number of photographs. Large prospective clinical validation studies led to the approval of DL for autonomous screening of DR although the semi-autonomous approach may be preferable in some real-world settings. There have been few reports on real-world implementations of DL for DR screening. It is possible that AI may improve some real-world indicators for eye care in DR, such as increased screening uptake and referral adherence, but this has not been proven. The challenges in deployment may include workflow issues, such as mydriasis to lower ungradable cases; technical issues, such as integration into electronic health record systems and integration into existing camera systems; ethical issues, such as data privacy and security; acceptance of personnel and patients; and health-economic issues, such as the need to conduct health economic evaluations of using AI in the context of the country.

This study introduces the Glu-Ensemble, a deep learning framework designed for precise blood glucose forecasting in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike other predictive models, Glu-Ensemble addresses challenges related to small sample sizes, data quality issues, reliance on strict statistical assumptions, and the complexity of models. It enhances prediction accuracy and model generalizability by utilizing larger datasets and reduces bias inherent in many predictive models. The framework's unified approach, as opposed to patient-specific models, eliminates the need for initial calibration time, facilitating immediate blood glucose predictions for new patients. The obtained results indicate that Glu-Ensemble surpasses traditional methods in accuracy, as measured by root mean square error, mean absolute error, and error grid analysis. The Glu-Ensemble framework emerges as a promising tool for blood glucose level prediction in type 2 diabetes patients, warranting further investigation in clinical settings for its practical application.

We also identify relevant prior information such as glycaemic variability that can be incorporated to improve predictive performance at long-term prediction horizons. Furthermore, we show consistent performance - ≤ 5% change in both RMSE and EGA (Zone A) - in rare cases of adverse glycaemic events with 1-6 weeks of training data.

Current blood glucose monitoring (BGM) methods are often invasive and require repetitive pricking of a finger to obtain blood samples, predisposing individuals to pain, discomfort, and infection. Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring (NIBGM) is ideal for minimizing discomfort, reducing the risk of infection, and increasing convenience.


OBJECTIVE
This review aimed to map the use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) in NIBGM.


METHODS
A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the Arksey O'Malley five-step framework. Eight electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane-Central Library, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) were searched from inception until February 8, 2023. Study selection was conducted by 2 independent reviewers, descriptive analysis was conducted, and findings were presented narratively. Study characteristics (author, country, type of publication, study design, population characteristics, mean age, types of noninvasive techniques used, and application, as well as characteristics of the BGM systems) were extracted independently and cross-checked by 2 investigators. Methodological quality appraisal was conducted using the Checklist for assessment of medical AI.


RESULTS
A total of 33 papers were included, representing studies from Asia, the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa published between 2005 and 2023. Most studies used optical techniques (n=19, 58%) to estimate blood glucose levels (n=27, 82%). Others used electrochemical sensors (n=4), imaging (n=2), mixed techniques (n=2), and tissue impedance (n=1). Accuracy ranged from 35.56% to 94.23% and Clarke error grid (A+B) ranged from 86.91% to 100%. The most popular machine learning algorithm used was random forest (n=10) and the most popular deep learning model was the artificial neural network (n=6). The mean overall checklist for assessment of medical AI score on the included papers was 33.5 (SD 3.09), suggesting an average of medium quality. The studies reviewed demonstrate that some AI techniques can accurately predict glucose levels from noninvasive sources while enhancing comfort and ease of use for patients. However, the overall range of accuracy was wide due to the heterogeneity of models and input data.


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts are needed to standardize and regulate the use of AI technologies in BGM, as well as develop consensus guidelines and protocols to ensure the quality and safety of AI-assisted monitoring systems. The use of AI for NIBGM is a promising area of research that has the potential to revolutionize diabetes management.","This scoping review maps AI applications in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, finding 33 studies with varying accuracy (35.56-94.23%) and quality, highlighting the need for standardization and regulation of AI technologies in BGM."
