- **Reasoning:** Uses systematic review to assess AI‑enabled wearable devices for blood‑glucose forecasting, covering sensor and CGM data, but lacks multimodal fusion, retinal imaging, and detailed taxonomy or benchmark discussions.","Background In 2021 alone, diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder primarily characterized by abnormally high blood glucose (BG) levels, affected 537 million people globally, and over 6 million deaths were reported. The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.

This requires patients to be aware of their blood glucose level oscillations every day to deduce a pattern and anticipate future glycemia, and hence, decide the amount of insulin that must be exogenously injected to maintain glycemia within the target range. This approach often suffers from a relatively high imprecision, which can be dangerous. Nevertheless, current developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and innovative sensors for biological signals that might enable a continuous, complete assessment of the patient’s health provide a fresh viewpoint on treating DM1. With this, we observe that current biomonitoring devices and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) units can easily obtain data that allow us to know at all times the state of glycemia and other variables that influence its oscillations. A complete review has been made of the variables that influence glycemia in a T1DM patient and that can be measured by the above means. The communications systems necessary to transfer the information collected to a more powerful computational environment, which can adequately handle the amounts of data collected, have also been described. From this point, intelligent data analysis extracts knowledge from the data and allows predictions to be made in order to anticipate risk situations. With all of the above, it is necessary to build a holistic proposal that allows the complete and smart management of T1DM. This approach evaluates a potential shortage of such suggestions and the obstacles that future intelligent IoMT-DM1 management systems must surmount. Lastly, we provide an outline of a comprehensive IoMT-based proposal for DM1 management that aims to address the limits of prior studies while also using the disruptive technologies highlighted before.","","",""

However, a critical gap exists around understanding the reproducibility of state-of-the-art methods for blood glucose prediction. In this study, we curated 60 deep learning (DL)-based glucose prediction papers published between 2018–2025 and assessed them against seven established reproducibility criteria. We found that code availability, overreliance on a single public dataset, and limited use of multiple datasets for algorithm development and evaluation are amongst the top challenges to reproducibility. Next, we replicated six representative models from well-cited prior literature using 4602 days of data with over 1.25 million glucose samples from 128 persons with type 1 diabetes across three public datasets - OhioT1DM, DiaTrend, and T1DEXI. Our results show good reproducibility of DL methods when using the same code (where available) and same evaluation dataset. However, we found poor conceptual reproducibility across datasets with significantly different diabetes management. Further analyses revealed that the accuracy of blood glucose prediction methods was significantly associated with individual diabetes management and sex/gender. All models had significantly higher prediction errors for individuals with worse glycemic control and for female subgroups compared to males. To accelerate development of robust and equitable algorithms for diabetes management, we conclude with recommendations for future researchers centered considerations for data selection, model design and selection, model evaluation and reporting results, documentation and code release.

Conventional machine learning (ML) models often struggle to generalize across patients due to individual variability, nonlinear glycemic dynamics, and sparse multimodal input data. This study aims to develop an advanced, interpretable deep learning (DL) framework for patient‐specific, policy‐aware blood glucose forecasting. Materials and Methods We propose GlucoNet‐MM, a novel multimodal DL framework that combines attention‐based multi‐task learning (MTL) with a Decision Transformer (DT), a reinforcement learning paradigm that frames policy learning as sequence modeling. The model integrates heterogeneous physiological and behavioral data, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin dosage, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity, to capture complex temporal dependencies. The MTL backbone learns shared representations across multiple prediction horizons, while the DT module conditions future glucose predictions on desired glycemic outcomes. Temporal attention visualizations and integrated gradient‐based attribution methods are used to provide interpretability, and Monte Carlo dropout is employed for uncertainty quantification. Results GlucoNet‐MM was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, BrisT1D and OhioT1DM. The model achieved R 2 scores of 0.94 and 0.96 and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.031 and 0.027, respectively. These results outperform single‐modality and conventional non‐adaptive baseline models, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Conclusion GlucoNet‐MM represents a promising step toward intelligent, personalized clinical decision support for diabetes care. Its multimodal design, policy‐aware forecasting, and interpretability features enhance both prediction accuracy and clinical trust, enabling proactive glycemic management tailored to individual patient needs.

However, developing a model generalized to a population and subsequently embedding it within a microchip of a wearable device presents significant technical challenges. Furthermore, the domain of BG prediction in T2D remains under-explored in the literature. In light of this, we propose a population-specific BG prediction model, leveraging the capabilities of the temporal fusion Transformer (TFT) to adjust predictions based on personal demographic data. Then the trained model is embedded within a system-on-chip, integral to our low-power and low-cost customized wearable device. This device seamlessly communicates with CGM systems through Bluetooth and provides timely BG predictions using edge computing. When evaluated on two publicly available clinical datasets with a total of 124 participants with T1D or T2D, the embedded TFT model consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest prediction errors when compared with a range of machine learning baseline methods. Executing the TFT model on our wearable device requires minimal memory and power consumption, enabling continuous decision support for more than 51 days on a single Li-Poly battery charge. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of the proposed TFT model and wearable device in enhancing the quality of life for people with diabetes and effectively addressing real-world challenges.","","",""

DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI ‘black-box’ algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art DL systems described for ophthalmic applications, potential challenges in clinical deployment and the path forward.","","",""

Potential healthcare disparities can happen when machine learning models, used in diabetes technologies, are trained on data from primarily White patients. We aimed to evaluate algorithmic fairness in glucose predictions. This study utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from 101 White and 104 Black participants with type 1 diabetes collected by the JAEB Center for Health Research, US. Long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models were trained on 11 datasets of different proportions of White and Black participants and tailored to each individual using transfer learning to predict glucose 60 minutes ahead based on 60-minute windows. Root mean squared errors (RMSE) were calculated for each participant. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the association between racial composition and RMSE while accounting for age, sex, and training data size. A median of 9 weeks (IQR: 7, 10) of CGM data was available per participant. The divergence in performance (RMSE slope by proportion) was not statistically significant for either group. However, the slope difference (from 0% White and 100% Black to 100% White and 0% Black) between groups was statistically significant (p=0.02), meaning the RMSE increased 0.04 [0.01, 0.08] mmol/L more for Black participants compared to White participants when the proportion of White participants increased from 0 to 100% in the training data. This difference was attenuated in the transfer learned models (RMSE: 0.02 [-0.01, 0.05] mmol/L, p=0.20). The racial composition of training data created a small statistically significant difference in the performance of the models, which was not present after using transfer learning. This demonstrates the importance of diversity in datasets and the potential value of transfer learning for developing more fair prediction models. ","","",""

This is particularly crucial for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who require long-term self-management. However, with extensive glycemic variability, developing a prediction algorithm applicable across diverse populations remains a significant challenge. Leveraging meta-learning for domain generalization, we propose GPFormer, a Transformer-based zero-shot learning method designed for multi-horizon glucose prediction. We developed GPFormer on the REPLACE-BG dataset, comprising 226 participants with T1D, and proceeded to evaluate its performance using three external clinical datasets with CGM data. These included the OhioT1DM dataset, a publicly available dataset including 12 T1D participants, as well as two proprietary datasets. The first proprietary dataset included 22 participants, while the second contained 45 participants, encompassing a diverse group with T1D, type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes, including patients admitted to hospitals. These four datasets include both outpatient and inpatient settings, various intervention strategies, and demographic variability, which effectively reflect real-world scenarios of CGM usage. When compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods, GPFormer consistently demonstrated superior performance and achieved the lowest root mean square error for all the evaluated datasets up to a prediction horizon of two hours. These experimental results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed model across a variety of populations, demonstrating its substantial potential to enhance glucose management in a wide range of practical clinical settings.

Although deep learning (DL) has successfully analyzed single-modality medical data, DR diagnosis often requires interpreting diverse information such as retinal imaging and clinical data. Multimodal data fusion has the potential to accommodate robust and complementary information between these sources for more accurate diagnostic decisions. However, DR detection using deep learning-based multimodal fusion is still challenging and underdeveloped. This review investigates recent advances in applying DL techniques to multimodal DR detection , focusing on model architecture, modality combinations, fusion strategies, and performance metrics. Among these architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most popular, and the fusion of fundus images with OCT or 1 EHR data is the most common pairing. Early and joint fusion strategies dominate, while model performance is typically assessed using accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score. Despite promising progress, the field still faces challenges including modality heterogeneity, lack of standardized multimodal datasets, and limited model interpretability. Emerging trends point toward hybrid architecture, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning as potential solutions. This review highlights current developments and outlines future directions to support the design of scalable, generalizable, and clinically applicable multimodal DL systems for DR detection.

Provides experimental results on the AI‑READI dataset but lacks review, bias analysis, retinal imaging, and deployment discussions.","Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistently high blood glucose levels (BGLs), leading to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Predicting BGLs enables patients to maintain glucose levels within a safe range and allows caregivers to take proactive measures through lifestyle modifications. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time tracking, offering a valuable tool for monitoring BGLs. However, accurately forecasting BGLs remains challenging due to fluctuations due to physical activity, diet, and other factors. Recent deep learning models show promise in improving BGL prediction. Nonetheless, forecasting BGLs accurately from multimodal, irregularly sampled data over long prediction horizons remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose AttenGluco, a multimodal Transformer-based framework for long-term blood glucose prediction. AttenGluco employs cross-attention to effectively integrate CGM and activity data, addressing challenges in fusing data with different sampling rates. Moreover, it employs multi-scale attention to capture long-term dependencies in temporal data, enhancing forecasting accuracy. To evaluate the performance of AttenGluco, we conduct forecasting experiments on the recently released AIREADI dataset, analyzing its predictive accuracy across different subject cohorts including healthy individuals, people with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we investigate its performance improvements and forgetting behavior as new cohorts are introduced. Our evaluations show that AttenGluco improves all error metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation, compared to the multimodal LSTM model. AttenGluco outperforms this baseline model by about 10% and 15% in terms of RMSE and MAE, respectively.","","",""

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model on biomedical temporal data based on a transformer architecture, and trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 non-diabetic individuals. We tokenized the CGM training data and trained GluFormer using next token prediction in a generative, autoregressive manner. We demonstrate that GluFormer generalizes effectively to 15 different external datasets, including 4936 individuals across 5 different geographical regions, 6 different CGM devices, and several metabolic disorders, including normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic populations, as well as those with gestational diabetes and obesity. GluFormer produces embeddings which outperform traditional CGM analysis tools, and achieves high Pearson correlations in predicting clinical parameters such as HbA1c, liver-related parameters, blood lipids, and sleep-related indices. Notably, GluFormer can also predict onset of future health outcomes even 4 years in advance. We also show that CGM embeddings from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the enhanced model can accurately generate CGM data based only on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods.

This review explores various approaches used in related studies to enhance understanding and management strategies of diabetes through data analysis. Various data analysis methods, including machine learning such as neural networks, Gaussian Process Classification (GPC), and deep learning, have been used to enhance illness management and forecast accuracy. One of the included studies created customised care plans and used data to forecast the likelihood of complications in diabetes.. Another focused on comparative approaches for diabetes diagnosis using artificial intelligence, while others explored disease classification techniques using GPC algorithms. On the other hand, some studies utilized deep learning to identify diverse trajectories of type 2 diabetes from routine medical records, while others developed wide and deep learning models to predict diabetes onset. This review notes that data analysis approaches have significantly advanced accuracy in diagnosis, predictive modeling, and disease management of diabetes. Integrating these technologies allows for more personalized treatment approaches, where patient data can tailor individualized care strategies. Study findings indicate that machine learning and deep learning applications not only enhance prediction accuracy but also unlock new potentials in identifying risk factors, managing complications, and preventing diseases.

The findings underscore the potential of AI in enhancing diabetes care, particularly in early disease detection and personalized lifestyle recommendations, addressing the significant health risks associated with diabetes, including increased morbidity and mortality. This study highlights the promising role of AI in revolutionizing diabetes management, advocating for its expanded use in healthcare settings to improve patient outcomes and optimize treatment efficacy.","","",""

Timely identification is critical to curb vision impairment. Algorithms for DR staging from digital fundus images (DFIs) have been recently proposed. However, models often fail to generalize due to distribution shifts between the source domain on which the model was trained and the target domain where it is deployed. A common and particularly challenging shift is often encountered when the source- and target-domain supports do not fully overlap. In this research, we introduce DRStageNet, a deep learning model designed to mitigate this challenge. We used seven publicly available datasets, comprising a total of 93,534 DFIs that cover a variety of patient demographics, ethnicities, geographic origins and comorbidities. We fine-tune DINOv2, a pretrained model of self-supervised vision transformer, and implement a multi-source domain fine-tuning strategy to enhance generalization performance. We benchmark and demonstrate the superiority of our method to two state-of-the-art benchmarks, including a recently published foundation model. We adapted the grad-rollout method to our regression task in order to provide high-resolution explainability heatmaps. The error analysis showed that 59\% of the main errors had incorrect reference labels. DRStageNet is accessible at URL [upon acceptance of the manuscript].","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Presents a novel multimodal CNN‑BiLSTM model for CGM prediction, fusing sensor streams with health records; offers limited discussion on generalization, deployment, but lacks review scope, wearable/retinal coverage, bias analysis, and dataset taxonomy.","Abstract The accurate prediction of blood glucose is critical for the effective management of diabetes. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology enables real-time acquisition of interstitial glucose concentrations, which can be calibrated against blood glucose measurements. However, a key challenge in the effective management of type 2 diabetes lies in forecasting critical events driven by glucose variability. While recent advances in deep learning enable modeling of temporal patterns in glucose fluctuations, most of the existing methods rely on unimodal inputs and fail to account for individual physiological differences that influence interstitial glucose dynamics. These limitations highlight the need for multimodal approaches that integrate additional personalized physiological information. One of the primary reasons for multimodal approaches not being widely studied in this field is the bottleneck associated with the availability of subjects’ health records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach trained on sequences of CGM values and enriched with physiological context derived from health records of 40 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The CGM time series were processed using a stacked Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network followed by an attention mechanism. The BiLSTM learned long-term temporal dependencies, while the CNN captured local sequential features. Physiological heterogeneity was incorporated through a separate pipeline of neural networks that processed baseline health records and was later fused with the CGM modeling stream. To validate our model, we utilized CGM values of 30 min sampled with a moving window of 5 min to predict the CGM values with a prediction horizon of (a) 15 min, (b) 30 min, and (c) 60 min. We achieved the multimodal architecture prediction results with Mean Absolute Point Error (MAPE) between 14 and 24 mg/dL, 19–22 mg/dL, 25–26 mg/dL in case of Menarini sensor and 6–11 mg/dL, 9–14 mg/dL, 12–18 mg/dL in case of Abbot sensor for 15, 30 and 60 min prediction horizon respectively. The results suggested that the proposed multimodal model achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to unimodal approaches; with upto 96.7% prediction accuracy; supporting its potential as a generalizable solution for interstitial glucose prediction and personalized management in the type 2 diabetes population.

One of the frequent complications of diabetes is diabetic retinopathy (DR): it is the leading cause of blindness in the working population of developed countries. As a result, ophthalmology is on the verge of a revolution in screening, diagnosing, and managing of pathologies. This upheaval is led by the arrival of technologies based on artificial intelligence. The ""Evaluation intelligente de la r\'etinopathie diab\'etique"" (EviRed) project uses artificial intelligence to answer a medical need: replacing the current classification of diabetic retinopathy which is mainly based on outdated fundus photography and providing an insufficient prediction precision. EviRed exploits modern fundus imaging devices and artificial intelligence to properly integrate the vast amount of data they provide with other available medical data of the patient. The goal is to improve diagnosis and prediction and help ophthalmologists to make better decisions during diabetic retinopathy follow-up. In this study, we investigate the fusion of different modalities acquired simultaneously with a PLEXElite 9000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc. Dublin, California, USA), namely 3-D structural optical coherence tomography (OCT), 3-D OCT angiography (OCTA) and 2-D Line Scanning Ophthalmoscope (LSO), for the automatic detection of proliferative DR.

GluMind devises two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention, which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance. Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate, addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset, which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people, individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.","","",""

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements. These results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D. The well-trained models can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts.","","",""

While current leading-edge transfer learning from pre-trained models can help with cases lacking data, it limits design choices, and generally results in the use of unnecessarily large models. We propose a novel, self-supervised training scheme for obtaining high-quality, pre-trained networks from unlabeled, cross-modal medical imaging data, which will allow for creating accurate and efficient models. We demonstrate this by accurately predicting optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based retinal thickness measurements from simple infrared (IR) fundus images. Subsequently, learned representations outperformed advanced classifiers on a separate diabetic retinopathy classification task in a scenario of scarce training data. Our cross-modal, three-staged scheme effectively replaced 26,343 diabetic retinopathy annotations with 1,009 semantic segmentations on OCT and reached the same classification accuracy using only 25% of fundus images, without any drawbacks, since OCT is not required for predictions. We expect this concept will also apply to other multimodal clinical data-imaging, health records, and genomics data, and be applicable to corresponding sample-starved learning problems.","","",""

Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation.

Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The “P4 of health”, a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem. Lastly, based on the developed framework, we aim to conduct regular surveys to capture up-to-date technological trends, sustainable health-related business models, and interdependencies.

By processing patients` longitudinal health records and bone-related tabular data, our model captures complex, long-range dependencies in disease progression that conventional methods often overlook. We validated our TabTrans model on a retrospective Qatar BioBank (QBB) cohort of 1,382 subjects, comprising 725 men (146 diabetic, 579 healthy) and 657 women (133 diabetic, 524 healthy). The study integrated electronic health records (EHR) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data. To address class imbalance, we employed SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN resampling techniques. The proposed model`s performance is evaluated against conventional machine learning (ML) and generative AI models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic`s constitutional AI), GPT-4 (OpenAI`s generative pre-trained transformer), and Gemini Pro (Google`s multimodal language model). Our TabTrans model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving ROC AUC $\geq$ 79.7 % for T2DM prediction compared to both generative AI models and conventional ML approaches. Feature interpretation analysis identified key risk indicators, with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume, ward bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), T and Z-scores, and L1-L4 scores emerging as the most important predictors associated with diabetes development in Qatari adults. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of TabTrans for analyzing complex tabular healthcare data, providing a powerful tool for proactive T2DM management and personalized clinical interventions in the Qatari population.

- **Reasoning:** Presents a novel transformer‑based glucose forecasting model with feature decomposition and knowledge distillation; touches on wearables, CGM, fusion, and edge deployment, but lacks review scope, retinal imaging, bias analysis, and broader democratization discussions.","The availability of continuous glucose monitors as over-the-counter commodities have created a unique opportunity to monitor a person's blood glucose levels, forecast blood glucose trajectories and provide automated interventions to prevent devastating chronic complications that arise from poor glucose control. However, forecasting blood glucose levels is challenging because blood glucose changes consistently in response to food intake, medication intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress. It is particularly difficult to accurately predict BGL from multimodal and irregularly sampled data and over long prediction horizons. Furthermore, these forecasting models must operate in real-time on edge devices to provide in-the-moment interventions. To address these challenges, we propose GlucoNet, an AI-powered sensor system for continuously monitoring behavioral and physiological health and robust forecasting of blood glucose patterns. GlucoNet devises a feature decomposition-based transformer model that incorporates patients' behavioral and physiological data and transforms sparse and irregular patient data (e.g., diet and medication intake data) into continuous features using a mathematical model, facilitating better integration with the BGL data. Given the non-linear and non-stationary nature of BG signals, we propose a decomposition method to extract both low and high-frequency components from the BGL signals, thus providing accurate forecasting. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose to employ knowledge distillation to compress the transformer model. GlucoNet achieves a 60% improvement in RMSE and a 21% reduction in the number of parameters, improving RMSE and MAE by 51% and 57%, using data obtained involving 12 participants with T1-Diabetes. These results underscore GlucoNet's potential as a compact and reliable tool for real-world diabetes prevention and management.","","",""

However, there are challenges in translating diagnostic performance and its application when deployed in real-world conditions. This study aimed to assess the technical feasibility of integration and diagnostic performance of validated DR screening (DRS) AI algorithms in real-world outpatient public health settings. Prior to integrating an AI algorithm for DR screening, the study involved several steps: (1) Five AI companies, including four from India and one international company, were invited to evaluate their diagnostic performance using low-cost nonmydriatic fundus cameras in public health settings; (2) The AI algorithms were prospectively validated on fundus images from 250 people with diabetes mellitus, captured by a trained optometrist in public health settings in Chandigarh Tricity in North India. The performance evaluation used diagnostic metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, compared to human grader assessments; (3) The AI algorithm with better diagnostic performance was integrated into a low-cost screening camera deployed at a community health center (CHC) in the Moga district of Punjab, India. For AI algorithm analysis, a trained health system optometrist captured nonmydriatic images of 343 patients. Three web-based AI screening companies agreed to participate, while one declined and one chose to withdraw due to low specificity identified during the interim analysis. The three AI algorithms demonstrated variable diagnostic performance, with sensitivity (60%-80%) and specificity (14%-96%). Upon integration, the better-performing algorithm AI-3 (sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 96, and accuracy: 88·43%) demonstrated high sensitivity of image gradability (99.5%), DR detection (99.6%), and referral DR (79%) at the CHC. This study highlights the importance of systematic AI validation for responsible clinical integration, demonstrating the potential of DRS to improve health care access in resource-limited public health settings.

This narrative review describes current uses of AI across major screening pathways. Prospective trials in mammography demonstrate non‑inferior cancer detection with large reductions in radiologist workload. In diabetic retinopathy, the first FDA‑authorized autonomous system extends specialist‑level screening into primary care and improves uptake. During colonoscopy, real‑time computer vision improves adenoma detection without increasing removal of non‑neoplastic tissue. Emerging multimodal approaches, including transformer‑based and large language model-enabled systems, integrate images, clinical variables, and molecular signals and underpin multi‑cancer early detection tests. Despite these gains, three constraints currently limit impact: the base‑rate problem in low‑prevalence cohorts, which magnifies the burden of false positives; limited generalizability and potential bias across institutions and populations; and practical barriers in workflow, regulation, and trust. Opportunities ahead include foundation models pre‑trained on diverse data, uncertainty‑aware ""decision referral,"" federated learning, larger representative datasets, and prospective trials that track interval cancers, stage shift, and cost‑effectiveness. The overarching conclusion is cautious optimism: when validated and invisibly integrated, AI augments physicians, expands access, and improves efficiency; realizing durable public‑health benefits will depend on equity‑focused design, rigorous evaluation, and sustained human oversight.","","",""

This research describes a two-part architecture that combines an energy-efficient wireless communication technology with an interpretable deep learning model for diabetes categorization. In Phase 1, a unique wireless communication model is created to assure the accurate transfer of real-time patient data from wearable devices to medical centers. Using Lagrange optimization, the model identifies the best transmission distance and power needs, lowering energy usage while preserving communication dependability. This contribution is especially essential since effective data transport is a necessary condition for continuous monitoring in large-scale healthcare systems. In Phase 2, the transmitted multimodal clinical, genetic, and lifestyle data are evaluated using a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.

This metabolic condition is defined by increased blood glucose concentrations. Among the different types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, caused by a lack of insulin secretion, is particularly challenging to treat. In this regard, automatic glucose level estimation implements Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices, showing positive therapeutic outcomes. AI-based glucose prediction has commonly followed a deterministic approach, usually with a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these AI-based methods do not provide enough information in critical decision-making scenarios, like in the medical field. This work intends to provide accurate, interpretable, and personalized glucose prediction using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), and also includes an uncertainty estimation. The TFT was trained using two databases, an in-house-collected dataset and the OhioT1DM dataset, commonly used for glucose forecasting benchmarking. For both datasets, the set of input features to train the model was varied to assess their impact on model interpretability and prediction performance. Models were evaluated using common prediction metrics, diabetes-specific metrics, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability of the model, including feature importance and attention. The obtained results showed that TFT outperforms existing methods in terms of RMSE by at least 13% for both datasets. ","","",""

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64±2.60 mg/dL and 31.07±3.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements. These results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D. The well-trained models can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts. ","","",""

Early and precise foretelling of DM remains a decisive factor for timely intervention, thereby mitigating severe downstream sequelae such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Conventional prognostic frameworks typically depend on exclusively either structured tabular measurements or visual medical imagery, which constrains comprehensive diagnostic capacity. This contribution confronts such limitation by advancing a hybrid machine learning (ML) methodology that synergistically combines deep learning—specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dedicated to retinal photograph scrutiny—with gradient-boosting machines (GBMs) that ingest structured demographic and clinical variables. Two publicly accessible repositories supplied training material: the Pima Indians Diabetes Database for tabular covariates and the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS 2019) Blindness Detection corpus for fundus imagery. Retinal studies underwent standardised pre-processing re-scaling, pixel normalisation, Gaussian denoising, and multiplicative augmentation while tabular patient records underwent rigorous feature ranking. Outcome representations from both data strata were concatenated into a consolidated tensor, thereby rendering simultaneous latent-space learning achievable. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms single-modality models, achieving an accuracy of 96%, a macro average F1 score of 0.96, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.994. The proposed approach offers a comprehensive diagnostic framework by combining systemic and localized disease indicators, thereby enhancing robustness, reducing variance, and supporting more informed clinical decision-making.

Most existing transfer learning research has been focused on model estimation, while there is a paucity of literature on transfer inference for model accuracy despite its importance. We propose a novel D oubly R obust A ugmented M odel A ccuracy T ransfer I nferen C e (DRA-MATIC) method for point and interval estimation of commonly used classiﬁcation performance measures in an unlabeled target population using labeled source data. Speciﬁcally, DRAMATIC derives and evaluates the risk model for a binary response Y against some low dimensional predictors A on the target population, leveraging Y from source data only and high-dimensional adjustment features X from both the source and target data. The method builds on top of an imputation model for the mean of Y | X and a density ratio model characterizing the distributional shift of X between the source and target populations. We ﬁrst develop a doubly robust estimating equation on the two models for the risk model of Y | A on the target population. Then a doubly robust estimation is constructed for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve used for the model accuracy evaluation. During the process, we mitigate the regularization biases incurred by the high-dimensional nuisance estimators of the imputation and density ratio models by constructing ap-propriate calibrated moment equations. The proposed estimators are doubly robust in the sense that they are n 12 consistent when at least one model is correctly speciﬁed, and certain model sparsity assumptions hold. that the point estimation has negligible bias and the conﬁdence intervals derived by DRAMATIC attain satisfactory empirical coverage levels. We further illustrate the utility of our method to transfer the genetic risk prediction model, and its accuracy evaluation for type II diabetes across two patient cohorts in Mass General Brigham (MGB) collected using diﬀerent sampling mechanisms and at diﬀerent time points.","","",""

Beyond traditional diagnostic and early detection systems, machine learning is already implemented to diagnose the disease. Nev ertheless, there are several gaps that are not addressed so far. In this research, a trustworthy machine learning framework is proposed for early warning of diabetes that integrates causal inference, interpretability, modern ensemble methods, and tabular deep learning to address the critical demands of reliability, fairness, and interpretability in clinical AI systems. The study utilizes a diverse model suite including LightGBM, XGBoost-DART, HistGBM, and TabNet, along with a novel Causal-guided Stacking Classifier (CGSC) using LightGBM as the meta learner. Causal Forests are employed for feature selection to prioritize stable and causally-relevant predictors in this particular model. For interpretability, SHAP is leveraged to provide global, local, and mean feature attribution for the best performing ensemble, while TabNet’s built-in attention mechanism is used to highlight local explanations and feature salience. As a basic fairness-aware design choice, gender was excluded as a feature to examine bias mitigation without compromising performance. Uncertainty quantification of the ensemble models is also provided. Counterfactuals are added for personalized disease prevention attempts.

In this study, we look at this problem from the perspective of the forecasting of future glucose values for diabetic people. In this study, we propose the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function. It penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on dangerous regions. In order to use the loss function in practice, we propose an algorithm that progressively improves the clinical acceptability of the model, so that we can achieve the best tradeoff possible between accuracy and given clinical criteria. We evaluate the approaches using two diabetes datasets, one having type-1 patients and the other type-2 patients. The results show that using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the models. In particular, the improvements are significant in the hypoglycemia region. We also show that this increased clinical acceptability comes at the cost of a decrease in the average accuracy of the model. Finally, we show that this tradeoff between accuracy and clinical acceptability can be successfully addressed with the proposed algorithm. For given clinical criteria, the algorithm can find the optimal solution that maximizes the accuracy while at the same meeting the criteria.","","",""

With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Introduces a causality‑driven domain‑generalization model for fundus DR grading, directly tackling image‑quality variation and dataset shift, and releases a 4DR benchmark; otherwise focuses narrowly on retinal imaging and does not address multimodal diabetes data, wearables, CGM, fairness, or deployment.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common diabetic complication, which usually leads to retinal damage, vision loss, and even blindness. A computer-aided DR grading system has a significant impact on helping ophthalmologists with rapid screening and diagnosis. Recent advances in fundus photography have precipitated the development of novel retinal imaging cameras and their subsequent implementation in clinical practice. However, most deep learning-based algorithms for DR grading demonstrate limited generalization across domains. This inferior performance stems from variance in imaging protocols and devices inducing domain shifts. We posit that declining model performance between domains arises from learning spurious correlations in the data. Incorporating do-operations from causality analysis into model architectures may mitigate this issue and improve generalizability. Specifically, a novel universal structural causal model (SCM) was proposed to analyze spurious correlations in fundus imaging. Building on this, a causality-inspired diabetic retinopathy grading framework named CauDR was developed to eliminate spurious correlations and achieve more generalizable DR diagnostics. Furthermore, existing datasets were reorganized into 4DR benchmark for DG scenario. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of CauDR.","","",""

  Research Design and Methods: Our training cohort was composed of patient (with type 2 diabetes) visits from Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1998 to 2014. We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen before the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the recommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational data, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more aggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove some datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On each subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment changes. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for every group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in that group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive treatment before considering less aggressive options. We tested this pipeline on unseen data from BMC, and an external dataset from Hartford healthcare (type 2 diabetes patient visits from January 2020 to May 2024).
  Results: The median HbA1c reduction achieved by our pipelines is 0.26% more than what the doctors achieved on the unseen BMC patients. For the Hartford cohort, our pipelines were better by 0.13%.
  Conclusions: This precise, interpretable, and efficient AI-backed approach to treatment progression in type 2 diabetes is predicted to outperform the current practice and can be deployed to improve patient outcomes.","","",""

Access to these continuous patterns about individuals' statuses offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying complex diseases and health conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a widely common chronic disease that its roots and progression patterns are not fully understood. Predicting the progression of T2D can inform timely and more effective interventions to prevent or manage the disease. In this study, we have used a dataset related to 63 patients with T2D that includes the data from two different types of wearable devices worn by the patients: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and activity trackers (ActiGraphs). Using this dataset, we created a model for predicting the levels of four major biomarkers related to T2D after a one-year period. We developed a wide and deep neural network and used the data from the demographic information, lab tests, and wearable sensors to create the model. The deep part of our method was developed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to process the time-series dataset collected by the wearables.

In this work, we adopt a causal framing to motivate conditional independence tests as a key tool for characterizing distribution shifts.

It can occur when the body does not produce enough insulin or when cells become resistant to insulin’s effects. There are two main types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2, which have different causes and risk factors. Early detection of diabetes allows for early intervention and management of the condition. This can help prevent or delay the development of serious complications associated with diabetes. Early diagnosis also allows for individuals to make lifestyle changes to prevent the progression of the disease. Healthcare systems play a vital role in the management and treatment of diabetes. They provide access to diabetes education, regular check-ups, and necessary medications for individuals with diabetes. They also provide monitoring and management of diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy. Through early detection, prevention and management programs, healthcare systems can help improve the quality of life and outcomes for people with diabetes. Current initiatives in healthcare systems for diabetes may fail due to lack of access to education and resources for individuals with diabetes. There may also be inadequate follow-up and monitoring for those who have been diagnosed, leading to poor management of the disease and lack of prevention of complications. Additionally, current initiatives may not be tailored to specific cultural or demographic groups, resulting in a lack of effectiveness for certain populations. In this study, we developed a diabetes prediction system using a healthcare framework.

Main text This review discusses the latest AI-driven methodologies in the context of DR and DME in terms of disease identification, patient-specific disease profiling, and short-term and long-term management. This includes current screening and diagnostic systems and their real-world implementation, lesion detection and analysis, disease progression prediction, and treatment response models. It also highlights the technical advancements that have been made in these areas.

We also explore the disparity between the potential of AI models and their actual effectiveness in real-world applications. Conclusion AI has the potential to revolutionize the management of DR and DME, offering more efficient and precise tools for healthcare professionals. However, overcoming challenges in deployment, regulatory compliance, and patient privacy is essential for these technologies to realize their full potential.

Traditional dietary assessment methods, such as self-reported food logs or diet recalls are time-intensive and prone to inaccuracies and biases. Several existing AI-driven frameworks are data intensive. In this study, we propose MealMeter, a machine learning driven method that leverages multimodal sensor data of wearable and mobile devices. Data are collected from 12 participants to estimate macronutrient intake. Our approach integrates physiological signals (e.g., continuous glucose, heart rate variability), inertial motion data, and environmental cues to model the relationship between meal intake and metabolic responses. Using lightweight machine learning models trained on a diverse dataset of labeled meal events, MealMeter predicts the composition of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats with high accuracy. Our results demonstrate that multimodal sensing combined with machine learning significantly improves meal macronutrient estimation compared to the baselines including foundation model and achieves average mean absolute errors (MAE) and average root mean squared relative errors (RMSRE) as low as 13.2 grams and 0.37, respectively, for carbohydrates.

Integrating AI with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) holds promise for near-future glucose prediction. However, existing models have limitations in capturing patterns of blood glucose fluctuations and demonstrate poor generalizability. A robust approach is needed to leverage massive CGM data for near-future glucose prediction. We propose large sensor models (LSMs) to capture knowledge in CGM data by modeling patients as sequences of glucose. CGM-LSM is pretrained on 15.96 million glucose records from 592 diabetes patients for near-future glucose prediction. We evaluated CGM-LSM against state-of-the-art methods using the OhioT1DM dataset across various metrics, prediction horizons, and unseen patients. Additionally, we assessed its generalizability across factors like diabetes type, age, gender, and hour of day. CGM-LSM achieved exceptional performance, with an rMSE of 29.81 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients and 23.49 mg/dL for type 2 diabetes patients in a two-hour prediction horizon. For the OhioT1DM dataset, CGM-LSM achieved a one-hour rMSE of 15.64 mg/dL, halving the previous best of 31.97 mg/dL. Robustness analyses revealed consistent performance not only for unseen patients and future periods, but also across diabetes type, age, and gender. The model demonstrated adaptability to different hours of day, maintaining accuracy across periods of various activity intensity levels. CGM-LSM represents a transformative step in diabetes management by leveraging pretraining to uncover latent glucose generation patterns in sensor data. Our findings also underscore the broader potential of LSMs to drive innovation across domains involving complex sensor data. ","","",""

Diabetes care in these regions often faces significant challenges, including inadequate healthcare infrastructure, limited financial resources, a shortage of trained healthcare personnel, and a dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers tailored and scalable solutions for addressing these systemic barriers by enabling early diagnosis and risk prediction, integrating diabetes care delivery across all levels of healthcare. However, the successful implementation of AI interventions requires an understanding of the unique infrastructural, technological, socio-political, and cultural factors influencing diabetes care in these regions. Objective This protocol outlines a systematic review to synthesize evidence on the barriers and facilitators to implementing AI-enabled diabetes interventions in lower-middle-income countries, and to examine the specific AI applications being deployed in these settings. Methods A comprehensive literature search will be performed across five databases: Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, encompassing peer-reviewed publications from 2015 to 2025. The review will include studies which assess AI-enabled interventions implemented in healthcare settings for diabetes prevention, diagnosis, and management in lower-middle-income countries. Studies that assess the efficacy of artificial intelligence tools without direct evaluation of these tools in clinical decision-making or patient care processes will be excluded. Two independent reviewers will assess studies for inclusion using a predefined search strategy. The reporting of results will adhere to the PRISMA 2020 checklist (1). The risk of bias in individual studies will be evaluated using Hawker’s tool for disparate study designs.

One of the essential challenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success. Unfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is notoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images. Simplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of people. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in many adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself. However, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency between different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection of diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus. Additionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which makes use of similar datasets with different labeling.

The number of diabetic patients will increase to 552 million by 2034, as per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Aim With advances in computer science techniques, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), opportunities for the detection of DR at the early stages have increased. This increase means that the chances of recovery will increase and the possibility of vision loss in patients will be reduced in the future. Methods In this paper, deep transfer learning models for medical DR detection were investigated. The DL models were trained and tested over the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) 2019 dataset. According to literature surveys, this research is considered one the first studies to use of the APTOS 2019 dataset, as it was freshly published in the second quarter of 2019. The selected deep transfer models in this research were AlexNet, Res-Net18, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, and VGG19. These models were selected, as they consist of a small number of layers when compared to larger models, such as DenseNet and InceptionResNet. Data augmentation techniques were used to render the models more robust and to overcome the overfitting problem. Results The testing accuracy and performance metrics, such as the precision, recall, and F1 score, were calculated to prove the robustness of the selected models. The AlexNet model achieved the highest testing accuracy at 97.9%. In addition, the achieved performance metrics strengthened our achieved results. Moreover, AlexNet has a minimum number of layers, which decreases the training time and the computational complexity.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep ensembles with uncertainty to achieve high‑accuracy DR screening on EyePACS images; focuses on retinal imaging, offers robustness insights, mentions a public dataset, but lacks multimodal review, wearable/CGM coverage, and broader deployment or fairness discussions.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.","","",""

However, how it will impact medicine and how to effectively mitigate it still remains unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive review of algorithmic fairness in the context of computational medicine, which aims at improving medicine with computational approaches. Specifically, we overview the different types of algorithmic bias, fairness quantification metrics, and bias mitigation methods, and summarize popular software libraries and tools for bias evaluation and mitigation, with the goal of providing reference and insights to researchers and practitioners in computational medicine.

We evaluated the impact of data shifts on an early warning system (EWS) for in-hospital mortality that uses electronic health record (EHR) data from patients admitted to a general internal medicine service. We found model performance to differ across subgroups of clinical diagnoses, sex and age. To explore the robustness of the model, we evaluated potentially harmful data shifts across demographics, hospital types, seasons, times of hospital admission, and whether the patient was admitted from an acute care institution or nursing home, without relying on model performance. Interestingly, we found that models trained on community hospitals experience harmful data shifts when evaluated on academic hospitals, whereas the models trained on academic hospitals transfer well to the community hospitals. To improve model performance across hospital sites we employed transfer learning, a strategy that stores knowledge gained from learning one domain and applies it to a different but related domain. We found hospital type-specific models that leverage transfer learning, perform better than models that use all available hospitals. Furthermore, we monitored data shifts over time and identified model deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Typically machine learning models remain locked after deployment, however, this can lead to model deterioration due to data shifts that occur over time. We used continual learning, the process of learning from a continual stream of data in a sequential manner, to mitigate data shifts over time and improve model performance. Overall, our study is a crucial step towards the deployment of clinical AI models, by providing strategies and workflows to ensure the safety and efficacy of these models in real-world settings.","","",""

However, issues of bias and fairness in these models must be addressed to ensure equitable treatment for all patients regardless of their gender. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of undersampling to balance the dataset both in terms of positive-negative samples and male-female gender groups and create a more robust and accurate machine learning model in predicting diabetes and prediabetes. In this study, we applied multiple machine learning classifiers to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2015) dataset, which is inherently imbalanced. We tested four algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multilayer Perceptron - using both the original and the balanced datasets. Our results indicate that balancing the dataset through undersampling improves the performance of all four algorithms in predicting diabetes. Specifically, Logistic Regression showed an increase in Precision from 0.53 to 0.74, while Random Forest showed an increase in F1-score from 0.25 to 0.75. K-Nearest Neighbors showed an increase in Recall from 0.19 to 0.73, and Multilayer Perceptron showed a significant increase in F1-score from 0.38 to 0.78. Moreover, our findings reveal that undersampling can improve fairness by mitigating gender bias from machine learning models, as measured by the Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR). The experiments depict a change in DIR for most algorithms when trained on the balanced dataset, for logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbour DIR decreases from 1.16 to 1.12, 1.14 to 1.08, and 1.05 to 1.02 respectively, indicating that the models are becoming fairer towards both gender groups. Our study demonstrates that undersampling can be a promising step towards creating more balanced, fair, and accurate machine learning models for gender subgroups.","","",""

Discusses image‑quality issues and model performance across populations, but does not review multimodal data, wearables, CGM, or broader AI challenges.","Summary Background Radical measures are required to identify and reduce blindness due to diabetes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. Methods We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. Findings A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8·1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0·973 (95% CI 0·969–0·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92·25% (90·10–94·12) and specificity of 89·04% (87·85–90·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99·42% (99·15–99·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97·19% (96·61–97·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

This pivotal trial of an AI system to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in people with diabetes enrolled 900 subjects, with no history of DR at primary care clinics, by comparing to Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center (FPRC) widefield stereoscopic photography and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), by FPRC certified photographers, and FPRC grading of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale (ETDRS) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). More than mild DR (mtmDR) was defined as ETDRS level 35 or higher, and/or DME, in at least one eye. AI system operators underwent a standardized training protocol before study start. Median age was 59 years (range, 22-84 years); among participants, 47.5% of participants were male; 16.1% were Hispanic, 83.3% not Hispanic; 28.6% African American and 63.4% were not; 198 (23.8%) had mtmDR.

To improve the quality of the transfer between multiple sources of data, we propose a multi-source adversarial transfer learning framework that enables the learning of a feature representation that is similar across the sources, and thus more general and more easily transferable We apply this idea to glucose forecasting for diabetic people using a fully convolutional neural network The evaluation is done by exploring various transfer scenarios with three datasets characterized by their high inter and intra variability 
While transferring knowledge is beneficial in general, we show that the statistical and clinical accuracies can be further improved by using of the adversarial training methodology, surpassing the current state-of-the-art results In particular, it shines when using data from different datasets, or when there is too little data in an intra-dataset situation To understand the behavior of the models, we analyze the learnt feature representations and propose a new metric in this regard Contrary to a standard transfer, the adversarial transfer does not discriminate the patients and datasets, helping the learning of a more general feature representation 
The adversarial training framework improves the learning of a general feature representation in a multi-source environment, enhancing the knowledge transfer to an unseen target 
The proposed method can help improve the efficiency of data shared by different health actors in the training of deep models","","",""

Currently, machine learning (ML) models are being constructed on local healthcare systems and are validated internally with no expectation that they would validate externally and thus, are rarely transferrable to a different healthcare system. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: .73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare system (concordance: .62-.90).

While these innovations significantly enhance glycemic control, patient autonomy, and clinical decision-making, equitable access remains a critical challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The objective of the study was to synthesize key clinical and technological insights from ATTD 2025, with a focus on their applicability in LMICs. This review evaluates the efficacy and adoption potential of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, AI-driven decision tools, next-generation CGM/CKM devices, and beta-cell replacement strategies, while also examining regulatory, infrastructural, and ethical considerations – using India as a case study for scalable implementation. Early adoption of AID systems in pediatric populations demonstrates substantial improvements in time-in-range (TIR) and psychosocial outcomes. CKM technologies offer earlier detection of diabetic ketoacidosis, and AI-powered platforms are driving personalized, real-time diabetes management. Despite these benefits, widespread adoption in LMICs is constrained by fragmented regulatory frameworks, affordability issues, limited reimbursement, and health system disparities. India’s emerging regulatory reforms, AI sandbox programs, and expanding digital health infrastructure suggest a replicable model for contextualizing global innovations. Bridging the diabetes technology divide in LMICs requires a systems-level approach that aligns innovation with affordability, digital readiness, and policy support. Multisectoral collaboration – including regulatory adaptation, public–private partnerships, and patient-centered design – is essential to achieving inclusive, sustainable access to next-generation diabetes care.

- **Reasoning:** Uses XAI to explain DR diagnoses, offering interpretability and brief deployment notes; focuses on a single imaging method, not a multimodal review.","Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision complications and partially sighted which pose considerable diagnostic difficulties because of its diverse and varying symptoms. Some of them include the fact that the disease displays a non-uniform pattern, where patients present different symptoms; the requirement of highly qualified specialists to interpret the images of the fundus; the risk of errors in the interpretation of images or their inconsistency; and the absence of clear morphological signs often makes early diagnosis unlikely. Traditional diagnosis mostly rely on the expert interpretation of retinal images, which can lead to bias and inaccuracy; highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods. Although traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods enhance the diagnostic capabilities remarkably, their black box nature and information opacity restrict healthcare providers to comprehend the reasoning framework of the AI to build trust and optimize its usage in practice. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging approach that addresses the black-box problem by improving the interpretability of models, which allows users to understand the logic behind certain decisions. This research proposed a diagnosis model for detecting diabetic retinopathy using XAI approaches that increases the interpretability of the models to help clinicians understand the reasons behind the decisions. The proposed model is used to enhance diagnostic accuracy, offer comprehensible, and concise insights regarding the diagnostics. The convergence history plots of the proposed model validate the learning process to achieve 94% better diagnostic accuracy than traditional methods while improving interpretability and applicability in healthcare settings, indicating improvement in accuracy and loss reduction.","","",""

It is therefore crucial to implement effective social risk management strategies at the point of care. Objective: To develop an EHR-based machine learning (ML) analytical pipeline to identify the unmet social needs associated with hospitalization risk in patients with T2D. Methods: We identified 10,192 T2D patients from the EHR data (from 2012 to 2022) from the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository, including contextual SDoH (e.g., neighborhood deprivation) and individual-level SDoH (e.g., housing stability). We developed an electronic health records (EHR)-based machine learning (ML) analytic pipeline, namely individualized polysocial risk score (iPsRS), to identify high social risk associated with hospitalizations in T2D patients, along with explainable AI (XAI) techniques and fairness assessment and optimization. Results: Our iPsRS achieved a C statistic of 0.72 in predicting 1-year hospitalization after fairness optimization across racial-ethnic groups. The iPsRS showed excellent utility for capturing individuals at high hospitalization risk; the actual 1-year hospitalization rate in the top 5% of iPsRS was ~13 times as high as the bottom decile. Conclusion: Our ML pipeline iPsRS can fairly and accurately screen for patients who have increased social risk leading to hospitalization in T2D patients.","","",""

Although there are multiple biosensing platforms for monitoring glucose available on the market, there is still a strong need to enhance their precision, repeatability, wearability, and accessibility to end-users. Biosensing technologies are being increasingly explored that use different bodily fluids such as sweat and tear fluid, etc., that can be calibrated to and therefore used to measure blood glucose concentrations accurately. To improve the wearability of these devices, exploring different fluids as testing mediums is essential and opens the door to various implants and wearables that in turn have the potential to be less inhibiting to the wearer. Recent developments have surfaced in the form of contact lenses or mouthguards for instance. Challenges still present themselves in the form of sensitivity, especially at very high or low glucose concentrations, which is critical for a diabetic person to monitor. This review summarises advances in wearable glucose biosensors over the past 5 years, comparing the different types as well as the fluid they use to detect glucose, including the CGMs currently available on the market. Perspectives on the development of wearables for glucose biosensing are discussed.","","",""

But most approaches to addressing the fairness of AI-enabled systems are limited in scope in two significant ways: their substantive content focuses on statistical measures of fairness, and they do not emphasize the need to identify and address fairness considerations across the whole AI lifecycle. Our contribution is to present an assurance framework and tool that can enable a practical and transparent method for widening the scope of fairness considerations across the AI lifecycle and move the discussion beyond mere statistical notions of fairness to consider a richer analysis in a practical and context-dependent manner. To illustrate this approach, we first describe and then apply the framework of Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to an AI-enabled clinical diagnostic support system (CDSS) whose purpose is to help clinicians predict the risk of developing hypertension in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a context in which several fairness considerations arise (e.g., discrimination against patient subgroups). This is supplemented by an open-source tool and a fairness considerations map to help facilitate reasoning about the fairness of AI-enabled systems in a participatory way. In short, by using a shared framework for identifying, documenting and justifying fairness considerations, and then using this deliberative exercise to structure an assurance case, research on AI fairness becomes reusable and generalizable for others in the ethical AI community and for sharing best practices for achieving fairness and equity in digital health and healthcare in particular.","","",""

This metabolic condition is defined by increased blood glucose concentration. Among the different types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes, caused by a lack of insulin secretion, has a particularly challenging treatment. In this regard, automatic glucose level estimation implements Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices, showing positive therapeutic outcomes. AI-based glucose prediction has commonly followed a deterministic approach, usually with lack of interpretability. Therefore, these AI-based methods do not provide enough information in critical decision-making scenarios, like in the medical field. This work intends to provide accurate, interpretable, and personalized glucose prediction using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), also including uncertainty estimation. The TFT was trained using two databases, an in-house collected dataset and the OhioT1DM dataset, commonly used for glucose forecasting benchmarking. For both datasets, the set of input features to train the model was varied to assess its impact on model interpretability and prediction performance. Models were evaluated using common prediction metrics, diabetes-specific metrics, uncertainty estimation and interpretability of the model, including feature importance and attention. Obtained results showed that TFT outperforms in terms of RMSE by at least 13% existing methods for both datasets. ","","",""

Using blood glucose data from type 2 diabetes patients, we propose a deep learning model-based framework to forecast blood glucose levels. We used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected from inpatients with type 2 diabetes for a week. We adopted the Transformer model, commonly used in sequence data, to forecast the blood glucose level over time and detect hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in advance. We expected the attention mechanism in Transformer to reveal a hint of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and performed a comparative study to determine whether Transformer was effective in the classification and regression of glucose. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia rarely occur and this results in an imbalance in the classification. We built a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network. Our contributions are as follows. First, we developed a deep learning framework utilizing the encoder part of Transformer to perform the regression and classification under a unified framework. Second, we adopted a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network suitable for time-series data to solve the data imbalance problem and to improve performance. Third, we collected data for type 2 diabetic inpatients for mid-time. Finally, we incorporated transfer learning to improve the performance of regression and classification.","","",""

Access to these continuous patterns about individuals' statuses offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying complex diseases and health conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a widely common chronic disease that its roots and progression patterns are not fully understood. Predicting the progression of T2D can inform timely and more effective interventions to prevent or manage the disease. In this study, we have used a dataset related to 63 patients with T2D that includes the data from two different types of wearable devices worn by the patients: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and activity trackers (ActiGraphs). Using this dataset, we created a model for predicting the levels of four major biomarkers related to T2D after a one-year period. We developed a wide and deep neural network and used the data from the demographic information, lab tests, and wearable sensors to create the model. The deep part of our method was developed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to process the time-series dataset collected by the wearables. In predicting the patterns of the four biomarkers, we have obtained a root mean square error of ±1.67% for HBA1c, ±6.22 mg/dl for HDL cholesterol, ±10.46 mg/dl for LDL cholesterol, and ±18.38 mg/dl for Triglyceride.

However, glucose predictions in the lower (hypoglycemia) and higher (hyperglycemia) extremes, referred as glycemic excursions, remain challenging due to their rarity. Moreover, limited access to sensitive patient data hampers the development of robust machine learning models even with advanced deep learning algorithms available. <italic>Methods:</italic> We propose to simultaneously provide accurate glucose predictions in the excursion regions while addressing data privacy concerns. To tackle excursion prediction, we propose a novel Hypo-Hyper (HH) loss function that penalizes errors based on the underlying glycemic range with a higher penalty at the extremes over the normal glucose range. On the other hand, to address privacy concerns, we propose FedGlu, a machine learning model trained in a federated learning (FL) framework. FL allows collaborative learning without sharing sensitive data by training models locally and sharing only model parameters across other patients. The HH loss combined within FedGlu addresses both the challenges at the same time. <italic>Results:</italic> The HH loss function demonstrates a 46% improvement over mean-squared error (MSE) loss across 125 patients. Compared to local models, FedGlu improved glycemic excursion detection by 35% compared to local models. This improvement translates to enhanced performance in predicting both, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, for 105 out of 125 patients. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed HH loss function in augmenting the predictive capabilities of glucose predictions. Moreover, implementing models within a federated learning framework not only ensures better predictive capabilities but also safeguards sensitive data concurrently. ","","",""

With regard to diabetes care, inequalities in access to essential medications, particularly insulin and novel therapies, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure are discussed. Proposed initiatives include international support programmes, improved healthcare provider training and the inclusion of newer diabetes medications in essential drug lists. The importance of global screening programmes, a universal diabetes education curriculum and standardised healthcare checklists is also emphasised. Regarding healthcare organisation, the development of national diabetes registers, benchmarking performance across regions and strengthening international collaborations are highly advised. The role of diabetes specialists as care coordinators and the need for structured assessments to improve early intervention and long-term outcomes are also discussed. Ultimately, the EASD Global Council urges action for a unified, global approach to diabetes research and care to bridge the gap between scientific innovation and clinical practice, ensuring equitable healthcare worldwide.

Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as ""black boxes,"" lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.","","",""

Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture VGG16 was employed for this study. A transfer learning process was implemented to re-train the CNN for robust OCTA classification. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of using this method for artificial intelligence (AI) screening of DR in clinical environments, the re-trained CNN was incorporated into a custom developed GUI platform which can be readily operated by ophthalmic personnel. Results: With last nine layers re-trained, CNN architecture achieved the best performance for automated OCTA classification. The overall accuracy of the re-trained classifier for differentiating healthy, NoDR, and NPDR was 87.27%, with 83.76% sensitivity and 90.82% specificity. The AUC metrics for binary classification of healthy, NoDR and DR were 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The GUI platform enabled easy validation of the method for AI screening of DR in a clinical environment. Conclusion: With a transfer leaning process to adopt the early layers for simple feature analysis and to re-train the upper layers for fine feature analysis, the CNN architecture VGG16 can be used for robust OCTA classification of healthy, NoDR, and NPDR eyes. Translational Relevance: OCTA can capture microvascular changes in early DR. A transfer learning process enables robust implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated OCTA classification of DR.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Uses retinal imaging to detect diabetic retinopathy and introduces a fairness‑focused adaptive scaling module, directly addressing bias and equity. Provides limited discussion of imaging challenges; otherwise focuses on a single new method rather than a broad multimodal review.","Background: As deep learning becomes increasingly accessible for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), questions persist regarding its performance equity among diverse identity groups. We aimed to explore the fairness of current deep learning models and further create a more equitable model designed to minimize disparities in performance across groups. Methods: This study used one proprietary and two publicly available datasets, containing two-dimensional (2D) wide-angle color fundus, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) fundus, and three-dimensional (3D) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) B-Scans, to assess deep learning models for DR detection. We developed a fair adaptive scaling (FAS) module that dynamically adjusts the significance of samples during model training for DR detection, aiming to lessen performance disparities across varied identity groups. FAS was incorporated into both 2D and 3D deep learning models to facilitate the binary classification of DR and non-DR cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was adopted to measure the model performance. Additionally, we devised an equity-scaled AUC metric that evaluates model fairness by balancing overall AUC against disparities among groups. Findings: Using in-house color fundus on the racial attribute, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating with FAS improved from 0.88 and 0.83 to 0.90 and 0.84 (p < 0.05), where the AUCs for Asians and Whites improved by 0.04 and 0.03, respectively (p < 0.01). On gender, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating with FAS both improved by 0.01 (p < 0.05). While using in-house SLO fundus on race, the overall AUC and ES-AUC of EfficientNet after integrating FAS improved from 0.80 to 0.83 (p < 0.01), where the AUCs for Asians, Blacks, and Whites improved by 0.02, 0.01 and 0.04, respectively (p < 0.05). On gender, FAS improved EfficientNet's overall AUC and ES-AUC both by 0.02, where the same improvement of 0.02 (p < 0.01) was gained for Females and Males. Using 3D deep learning model DenseNet121 on in-house OCT-B-Scans on race, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC from 0.875 and 0.81 to 0.884 and 0.82 respectively, where the AUCs for Asians and Blacks improved by 0.03 and 0.02 (p < 0.01). On gender, FAS improved the overall AUC and ES-AUC of DenseNet121 by 0.04 and 0.03, whereas the AUCs for Females and Males improved by 0.05 and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively. Interpretation: Existing deep learning models indeed exhibit variable performance across diverse identity groups in DR detection. The FAS proves beneficial in enhancing model equity and boosting DR detection accuracy, particularly for underrepresented groups.","","",""

However, most existing models are task-specific and lack generalization across patient populations. Inspired by the autoregressive paradigm of large language models, we introduce CGM-LSM, a Transformer decoder-based Large Sensor Model (LSM) pretrained on 1.6 million CGM records from patients with different diabetes types, ages, and genders. We model patients as sequences of glucose time steps to learn latent knowledge embedded in CGM data and apply it to the prediction of glucose readings for a 2-h horizon. Compared with prior methods, CGM-LSM significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness: a 48.51% reduction in root mean square error in 1-h horizon forecasting and consistent zero-shot prediction performance across held-out patient groups. We analyze model performance variations across patient subgroups and prediction scenarios and outline key opportunities and challenges for advancing CGM foundation models. ","","",""

Detection of DR requires substantial human resources and high medical costs. Therefore, the use of diagnostic software has been recently explored. The study aimed to assess the results of DR diagnoses by Cybersight, an artificial intelligence software. A total of 1,012 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (1,943 eyes) with a mean age of 74.61 ± 6.73 years were included. Comprehensive demographic and clinical data were gathered, and all patients underwent color fundus photography following Cybersight's standardized protocols. The study compared Cybersight's accuracy with that of ophthalmologists in identifying key DR lesions, including retinal microvascular changes, exudates, hemorrhages, the diagnosis and staging of DR, using sensitivity, specificity, and weighted Kappa metrics. The prevalence of DR was 16.2%. A high level of agreement was found between Cybersight and ophthalmologists in DR diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 85.0%, specificity of 95.8%, and a weighted Kappa of 0.78.

Developing robust AI models for DR classification holds substantial potential, but a key challenge is ensuring their generalization in unfamiliar domains with varying data distributions. To address this, our paper investigates cross-domain generalization, also known as domain generalization (DG), within the context of DR classification. DG, a challenging problem in the medical domain, is complicated by the difficulty of gathering labeled data across different domains, such as patient demographics and disease stages. Some recent studies have shown the effectiveness of using CLIP to handle the DG problem in natural images. In this study, we investigate CLIP's transfer learning capabilities and its potential for cross-domain generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification. We carry out comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy and potential of CLIP in addressing DG for DR classification. Further, we introduce a multi-modal fine-tuning strategy named Context Optimization with Learnable Visual Tokens (CoOpLVT), which enhances context optimization by conditioning on visual features. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method increases the F1-score by 1.8% over the baseline, thus underlining its promise for effective DG in DR classification.

Results Of the 193 patients (93 [48%] female; mean [SD] age, 55 [17] years [range, 18-87 years]), the AI system judged 17 as having diabetic retinopathy of sufficient severity to require referral. The system correctly identified 2 patients with true disease and misclassified 15 as having disease (false-positives). The resulting specificity was 92% (95% CI, 87%-96%), and the positive predictive value was 12% (95% CI, 8%-18%). Many false-positives were driven by inadequate image quality (eg, dirty lens) and sheen reflections. Conclusions and Relevance The results demonstrate both the potential and the challenges of using AI systems to identify diabetic retinopathy in clinical practice.

A total of 33 consenting participants (14%) were excluded from the primary analysis due to ungradable or missing images from small pupils (n = 21, 63.6%), cataract (n = 7, 21.2%), poor fixation (n = 2, 6.1%), technical issues (n = 2, 6.1%), and corneal scarring (n = 1, 3%). The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI system for referable DR were 0.92, 96.9% and 87.7%, respectively. There were 51 disagreements between the reference standard and index test diagnoses, including 29 which were manually graded as ungradable, 21 false positives, and one false negative. A total of 28 participants (11.9%) were referred for follow-up based on new ocular findings, among whom, 15 (53.6%) were able to be contacted and 9 (60%) adhered to referral. Of 207 participants who completed a satisfaction questionnaire, 93.7% specified they were either satisfied or extremely satisfied, and 93.2% specified they would be likely or extremely likely to use this service again.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on racial bias assessment and mitigation in clinical ML, offering bias metrics and mitigation methods; briefly mentions deployment challenges but lacks diabetes‑specific content.","Background Racial bias is a key concern regarding the development, validation, and implementation of machine learning (ML) models in clinical settings. Despite the potential of bias to propagate health disparities, racial bias in clinical ML has yet to be thoroughly examined and best practices for bias mitigation remain unclear. Objective Our objective was to perform a scoping review to characterize the methods by which the racial bias of ML has been assessed and describe strategies that may be used to enhance algorithmic fairness in clinical ML. Methods A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases, as well as Google Scholar, identified 635 records, of which 12 studies were included. Results Applications of ML were varied and involved diagnosis, outcome prediction, and clinical score prediction performed on data sets including images, diagnostic studies, clinical text, and clinical variables. Of the 12 studies, 1 (8%) described a model in routine clinical use, 2 (17%) examined prospectively validated clinical models, and the remaining 9 (75%) described internally validated models. In addition, 8 (67%) studies concluded that racial bias was present, 2 (17%) concluded that it was not, and 2 (17%) assessed the implementation of bias mitigation strategies without comparison to a baseline model. Fairness metrics used to assess algorithmic racial bias were inconsistent. The most commonly observed metrics were equal opportunity difference (5/12, 42%), accuracy (4/12, 25%), and disparate impact (2/12, 17%). All 8 (67%) studies that implemented methods for mitigation of racial bias successfully increased fairness, as measured by the authors’ chosen metrics. Preprocessing methods of bias mitigation were most commonly used across all studies that implemented them. Conclusions The broad scope of medical ML applications and potential patient harms demand an increased emphasis on evaluation and mitigation of racial bias in clinical ML. However, the adoption of algorithmic fairness principles in medicine remains inconsistent and is limited by poor data availability and ML model reporting. We recommend that researchers and journal editors emphasize standardized reporting and data availability in medical ML studies to improve transparency and facilitate evaluation for racial bias.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Uses deep‑learning DR screening to model cost savings, offering strong deployment insight for health systems; limited to retinal imaging, no multimodal review or broader AI challenges.","Summary Background Deep learning is a novel machine learning technique that has been shown to be as effective as human graders in detecting diabetic retinopathy from fundus photographs. We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without human assessment. Methods In this economic analysis modelling study, using 39 006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and TreeAge Pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the results to key model assumptions. Findings From the health system perspective, the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, at US$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to the Singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model are estimated to be $489 000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual screening cost. By 2050, Singapore is projected to have 1 million people with diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million. Interpretation This study provides a strong economic rationale for using deep learning systems as an assistive tool to screen for diabetic retinopathy.

- **Reasoning:** Presents a quantum denoising autoencoder for retinal fundus images, offering a novel method rather than a review; only retinal imaging and dataset use align partially with criteria.","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a critical source of blindness that can be prevented globally, and accurate analysis of retinal fundus images enables early detection. Fundus images are often affected by multiple noise sources, which impair image quality and hinder the observation of delicate retinal structures, including microaneurysms and small blood vessels. Deep learning driven denoising models are computationally intensive and prone to overfitting on small medical datasets. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the present paper suggests a Quantum Denoising Autoencoder (QDAE), a hybrid quantum-classical architecture, which uses convolutional feature coding with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in latent space. The suggested QDAE applies quantum superposition and entanglement to improve the latent representations, thereby improving denoising and retinal detail preservation. Experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy 224 × 224 (2019) dataset show that QDAE performs considerably better than classical denoising architectures, including CAE, ResNet, and DnCNN with PSNR of 38.8 dB, SSIM of 0.96, and AMI of 0.88. The approach preserves delicate retinal patterns and intensity consistency, while incurring a slight computational overhead associated with shallow quantum circuits. The results presented above demonstrate that QDAE is a potential quantum-aided architecture for denoising retinal images and a feasible preprocessing procedure in early diabetic retinopathy.","","",""

A cross-sectional study. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2020 were analyzed, involving 8249 participants categorized into healthy controls (n = 6830), diabetes without retinopathy (n = 918), and DR (n = 501). Immunometabolic indices reflecting insulin resistance, inflammation, and lipid metabolism were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed associations with DR, and Bayesian kernel machine regression analyzed nonlinear interactions. Eight ML models, including ensemble methods, were developed to predict DR risk, with feature importance determined by SHapley Additive exPlanations. The primary outcome was DR status, classified according to the ETDRS criteria from fundus photography. Key immunometabolic indices, notably Frailty Index (FRAILTY) and fasting serum insulin (FSI), were significantly associated with increased DR risk, whereas the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS) showed a protective effect. Bayesian kernel machine regression highlighted complex interactions among indices. Machine learning models achieved high predictive accuracy, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM (area under the curve > 0.9). SHapley Additive exPlanations analyses identified FRAILTY, FSI, and METS as the most influential predictors. Immunometabolic dysregulation significantly contributes to DR progression beyond traditional risk factors such as hyperglycemia alone. Incorporating immunometabolic indices into predictive models substantially enhances DR risk stratification, facilitating personalized screening and intervention strategies. Machine learning approaches effectively identify high-risk individuals, underscoring their utility in clinical practice for early DR detection and targeted preventive care.

Early detection and accurate classification of DR are essential for effective treatment and the prevention of vision loss. Traditional diagnostic methods such as manual inspection of retinal images are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to variability in expert opinion. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning have provided promising solutions for automating this process. The proposed framework introduces an automated system for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system comprises three major stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. GANs are utilized for generating high-quality synthetic retinal images to enhance the dataset and improve model robustness. CNNs are employed to extract deep features and classify the severity of DR. This method significantly improves detection accuracy and generalization. Future developments will focus on increasing dataset diversity, optimizing the GAN architecture, and integrating the system for real-time screening applications in clinical settings. ","","",""

The commonly used early and intermediate fusions are simple but do not fully exploit the complementary information between modalities. We developed a hierarchical fusion approach that focuses on combining features across multiple dimensions of the network, as well as exploring the correlation between modalities. These approaches were applied to glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy classification, using the public GAMMA dataset (fundus photographs and OCT) and a private dataset of PlexElite 9000 (Carl Zeis Meditec Inc.)

Limited to a single method; lacks broader review, wearable, imaging, bias, deployment, or democratization discussion.","Accurate forecasting of blood glucose from CGM is essential for preventing dysglycemic events, thus enabling proactive diabetes management. However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.","","",""

Hence, regular glucose monitoring is essential for diabetic patients to prevent serious complications. With the advancement of AI technology, the feasibility of ML in diabetes management, specifically in blood glucose monitoring, has become a prominent area of investigation for many researchers. Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews different ML models, such as CNN, RNN, DT, SVM, and ARIMA, in the context of glucose monitoring. The review suggests that ML models can forecast future glucose levels within a certain prediction horizon while yielding reasonable accuracy. Such technology can ultimately improve glycemic control and prevent the serious complications of diabetes by taking appropriate treatments or actions in advance. However, challenges and limitations exist in the practical implementation of these models, including reliability, user-friendliness, and generalization. Future research should focus on developing universal and accurate models that can be tailored to specific patient groups while accounting for heterogeneity in glucose metabolism.","","",""

Methods We used 26,699 fundus images of 17,834 diabetic patients from three Taiwanese hospitals collected in 2007 to 2018 for DR severity classification. Thirty-seven ophthalmologists verified the images using lesion annotation and severity classification as the ground truth. Two deep learning fusion architectures were proposed: late fusion, which combines lesion and severity classification models in parallel using a postprocessing procedure, and two-stage early fusion, which combines lesion detection and classification models sequentially and mimics the decision-making process of ophthalmologists. Messidor-2 was used with 1748 images to evaluate and benchmark the performance of the architecture. The primary evaluation metrics were classification accuracy, weighted κ statistic, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results For hospital data, a hybrid architecture achieved a good detection rate, with accuracy and weighted κ of 84.29% and 84.01%, respectively, for five-class DR grading. It also classified the images of early stage DR more accurately than conventional algorithms. The Messidor-2 model achieved an AUC of 97.09% in referral DR detection compared to AUC of 85% to 99% for state-of-the-art algorithms that learned from a larger database. Conclusions Our hybrid architectures strengthened and extracted characteristics from DR images, while improving the performance of DR grading, thereby increasing the robustness and confidence of the architectures for general use.

Using blood glucose data from type 2 diabetes patients, we propose a deep learning model-based framework to forecast blood glucose levels. We used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected from inpatients with type 2 diabetes for a week. We adopted the Transformer model, commonly used in sequence data, to forecast the blood glucose level over time and detect hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in advance. We expected the attention mechanism in Transformer to reveal a hint of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and performed a comparative study to determine whether Transformer was effective in the classification and regression of glucose. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia rarely occur and this results in an imbalance in the classification. We built a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network. Our contributions are as follows. First, we developed a deep learning framework utilizing the encoder part of Transformer to perform the regression and classification under a unified framework. Second, we adopted a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network suitable for time-series data to solve the data imbalance problem and to improve performance. Third, we collected data for type 2 diabetic inpatients for mid-time. Finally, we incorporated transfer learning to improve the performance of regression and classification. ","","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are emerging as tools to support safe and individualized diabetes management during fasting. To explore the current and potential roles of AI in diabetes care during Ramadan, with a focus on clinical applications, patient outcomes, provider training, and barriers to adoption. AI is integrated into diabetes care through automated insulin delivery systems and machine learning–based risk prediction models. These tools support real-time glucose monitoring, hypoglycemia prevention, and personalized care, especially for high-risk groups. Type 1 diabetes patients benefit from closed-loop systems, whereas type 2 diabetes patients primarily use AI for predictive analytics. Regional resources, digital literacy, cultural perceptions, and provider training influence adoption. Barriers include cost, regulatory gaps, and algorithmic limitations in diverse populations. AI technologies hold promises for enhancing safety and glycemic outcomes for individuals with diabetes during Ramadan. Their optimal use depends on context-specific strategies, including culturally sensitive education, equitable access, and comprehensive training for providers. Further validation and customization of AI tools for fasting populations are necessary to support the widespread and effective implementation of these tools. ","","",""

Mentions transfer learning, touching on generalization, yet lacks discussion of bias, deployment, or democratization.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a significant cause of vision impairment, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and timely intervention to avert visual deterioration. Diagnosing DR is inherently complex, as it necessitates the meticulous examination of intricate retinal images by experienced specialists. This makes the early diagnosis of DR essential for effective treatment and prevention of eventual blindness. Traditional diagnostic methods, relying on human interpretation of medical images, face challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the present research, we introduce a novel method that offers superior precision in DR diagnosis, compared to traditional methods, by employing advanced deep learning techniques. Central to this approach is the concept of transfer learning. This entails the utilization of pre-existing, well-established models, specifically InceptionResNetv2 and Inceptionv3, to extract features and fine-tune selected layers to cater to the unique requirements of this specific diagnostic task. Concurrently, we also present a newly devised model, DiaCNN, which is tailored for the classification of eye diseases. To prove the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we leveraged the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which comprises eight different eye disease categories. The results are promising. The InceptionResNetv2 model, incorporating transfer learning, registered an impressive 97.5% accuracy in both the training and testing phases. Its counterpart, the Inceptionv3 model, achieved an even more commendable 99.7% accuracy during training, and 97.5% during testing. Remarkably, the DiaCNN model showcased unparalleled precision, achieving 100% accuracy in training and 98.3% in testing. These figures represent a significant leap in classification accuracy when juxtaposed with existing state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Such advancements hold immense promise for the future, emphasizing the potential of our proposed technique to revolutionize the accuracy of DR and other eye disease diagnoses. By facilitating earlier detection and more timely interventions, this approach stands poised to significantly reduce the incidence of blindness associated with DR, thus heralding a new era of improved patient outcomes. Therefore, this work, through its novel approach and stellar results, not only pushes the boundaries of DR diagnostic accuracy but also promises a transformative impact in early detection and intervention, aiming to substantially diminish DR-induced blindness and champion enhanced patient care.

There has been keen interest to apply deep learning in the medical domain, particularly specialties that heavily utilize imaging, such as ophthalmology. One issue that may hinder application of deep learning to the medical domain is the vast amount of data necessary to train deep neural networks (DNNs). Because of regulatory and privacy issues associated with medicine, and the generally proprietary nature of data in medical domains, obtaining large datasets to train DNNs is a challenge, particularly in the ophthalmology domain.
  Transfer learning is a technique developed to address the issue of applying DNNs for domains with limited data. Prior reports on transfer learning have examined custom networks to fully train or used a particular DNN for transfer learning. However, to the best of my knowledge, no work has systematically examined a suite of DNNs for transfer learning for classification of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and two key features of age-related macular degeneration. This work attempts to investigate transfer learning for classification of these ophthalmic conditions. Part I gives a condensed overview of neural networks and the DNNs under evaluation. Part II gives the reader the necessary background concerning diabetic retinopathy and prior work on classification using retinal fundus photographs. The methodology and results of transfer learning for diabetic retinopathy classification are presented, showing that transfer learning towards this domain is feasible, with promising accuracy. Part III gives an overview of diabetic macular edema, choroidal neovascularization and drusen (features associated with age-related macular degeneration), and presents results for transfer learning evaluation using optical coherence tomography to classify these entities.","","",""

Design Cross-sectional analysis of a retinal image data set from a previous prospective OCT angiography (OCTA) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03422965). Participants Patients with T1DM included in the progenitor study. Methods Radiomic features were extracted from color fundus photographs (CFPs), OCT, and OCTA images, and ML models were trained using these features either individually or combined with clinical data (demographics and systemic data, OCT + OCTA commercial software metrics, ocular data, blood data). Different data combinations were tested to determine the CV risk stages, defined according to international classifications. Main Outcome Measures Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve mean and standard deviation for each ML model and each data combination. Results A data set of 597 eyes (359 individuals) was analyzed. Models trained only with the radiomic features achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of (0.79 ± 0.03) to identify moderate risk cases from high and very high-risk cases, and (0.73 ± 0.07) for distinguishing between high and very high-risk cases. The addition of clinical variables improved all AUC values, obtaining (0.99 ± 0.01) for identifying moderate cases, and (0.95 ± 0.02) for differentiating between high and very high-risk cases. For very high CV risk, radiomics combined with OCT + OCTA metrics and ocular data achieved an AUC of (0.89 ± 0.02) without systemic data input. The performance of the models was similar in unilateral and bilateral eye image data sets. Conclusions Radiomic features obtained from retinal images are helpful to discriminate and classify CV risk labels, differentiating risk categories. The addition of demographics and systemic data combined with ocular data differentiate high from very high CV risk cases, and interestingly OCT + OCTA metrics with ocular data identify very high CV risk cases without systemic data input. These results reflect the potential of this oculomics approach for CV risk assessment.

Objective To evaluate the performance of Medios AI (Remidio), a proprietary, offline, smartphone-based, automated system of analysis of retinal images, to detect referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) in images taken by a minimally trained health care worker with Remidio Non-Mydriatic Fundus on Phone, a smartphone-based, nonmydriatic retinal camera. Referable diabetic retinopathy is defined as any retinopathy more severe than mild diabetic retinopathy, with or without diabetic macular edema. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective, cross-sectional, population-based study took place from August 2018 to September 2018. Patients with diabetes mellitus who visited various dispensaries administered by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai in Mumbai, India, on a particular day were included. Interventions Three fields of the fundus (the posterior pole, nasal, and temporal fields) were photographed. The images were analyzed by an ophthalmologist and the AI system. Main Outcomes and Measures To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the offline automated analysis system in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy on images taken on the smartphone-based, nonmydriatic retinal imaging system by a health worker. Results Of 255 patients seen in the dispensaries, 231 patients (90.6%) consented to diabetic retinopathy screening. The major reasons for not participating were unwillingness to wait for screening and the blurring of vision that would occur after dilation. Images from 18 patients were deemed ungradable by the ophthalmologist and hence were excluded. In the remaining participants (110 female patients [51.6%] and 103 male patients [48.4%]; mean [SD] age, 53.1 [10.3] years), the sensitivity and specificity of the offline AI system in diagnosing referable diabetic retinopathy were 100.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-100.0%) and 88.4% (95% CI, 83.2%-92.5%), respectively, and in diagnosing any diabetic retinopathy were 85.2% (95% CI, 66.3%-95.8%) and 92.0% (95% CI, 97.1%-95.4%), respectively, compared with ophthalmologist grading using the same images. Conclusions and Relevance These pilot study results show promise in the use of an offline AI system in community screening for referable diabetic retinopathy with a smartphone-based fundus camera. The use of AI would enable screening for referable diabetic retinopathy in remote areas where services of an ophthalmologist are unavailable. This study was done on patients with diabetes who were visiting a dispensary that provides curative services to the population at the primary level. A study with a larger sample size may be needed to extend the results to general population screening, however.","","",""

It may be pre-existing due to diabetes mellitus or develop during hospitalization as stress hyperglycemia. This review aims to raise awareness among medical staff regarding the implications of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients, its pathophysiology, monitoring techniques, and current treatment protocols. Therefore, evidence from the international literature is analyzed, with specialized journals serving as reference points, focusing on the impact of glycemic variability, individualized patient management, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence-driven biosensors for glucose monitoring. Hyperglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level exceeding 7.0 mmol/l (125 mg/dl) before admission or surpassing 10.0 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) two hours postprandial. Monitoring can be conducted using arterial or capillary blood, continuous glucose monitoring systems, or artificial intelligence-enhanced biosensors. Regardless of their diabetic status, patients present unique clinical features. Those with pre-existing diabetes may experience hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, electrolyte imbalances, and dehydration, necessitating meticulous monitoring and intervention. Special attention must be given to glycemic variability, maintaining levels between 3.8 and 10.0 mmol/l (70-180 mg/dl), and timely interventions to prevent complications. Current treatment protocols prioritize intravenous insulin infusion based on multiple clinical studies on hyperglycemic intensive care unit (ICU) patients. To minimize complications, maintaining glucose levels between 6.1 and 10.0 mmol/l (110-180 mg/dl) is recommended, balancing the risk of hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia negatively impacts mortality due to systemic damage and the delayed detection of glucose dysregulation.

To enhance model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a powerful technique, are employed to offer transparent insights into prediction rationale. Through SHAP values, the impact of individual features on model predictions is uncovered, demystifying the decision-making process. Traditional models like decision trees inherently provide interpretability, whereas complex models like neural networks benefit from SHAP values to reveal their prediction drivers. The analysis not only identifies influential features but also aids in assessing model fairness and robustness. The results highlight the delicate balance between model complexity and transparency.

DG experiment trained models using algorithms that estimated invariant properties using 2008–2016 and evaluated them on 2017– 2019. UDA experiment leveraged unlabelled samples from 2017–2019 for unsupervised distribution matching. DG and UDA models were compared to ERM[08-16] models trained using 2008-2016. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Main performance measures were area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC), area-under-the-precision-recall curve and absolute calibration error. Threshold-based metrics including false-positives and false-negatives were used to assess the clinical impact of temporal dataset shift and its mitigation strategies. Results In the baseline experiments, dataset shift was most evident for sepsis prediction (maximum AUROC drop, 0.090; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080-0.101). Considering a scenario of 100 consecutively admitted patients showed that ERM[08-10] applied to 2017-2019 was associated with one additional false-negative among 11 patients with sepsis, when compared to the model applied to 2008-2010. When compared with ERM[08-16], DG and UDA experiments failed to produce more robust models (range of AUROC difference, −0.003-0.050). Conclusions and Relevance DG and UDA failed to produce more robust models compared to ERM in the setting of temporal dataset shift. Alternate approaches are required to preserve model performance over time in clinical medicine. KEY POINTS Question Can algorithms that estimate invariant properties across environments for domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation improve the robustness of machine learning-derived clinical prediction models to temporal dataset shift? Findings In this cohort study using 4 clinical outcomes, domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms did not meaningfully outperform the standard model training algorithm – empirical risk minimization – in learning robust models that generalize over time in the presence of temporal dataset shift. Meaning These findings highlight the difficulty of improving robustness to dataset shift with purely data-driven techniques that do not leverage prior knowledge of the nature of the shift and the requirement of alternate approaches to preserve model performance over time in clinical medicine.","","",""

Due to the progressive nature of the disease, earlier detection and timely treatment can lead to substantial reductions in the incidence of irreversible vision-loss. Artificial intelligence (AI) screening systems have offered clinically acceptable and quicker results in detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant investigations was performed to document the performance of AI screening systems that were applied to fundus and OCT images of patients from diverse geographic locations including North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. A systematic literature search on Medline, Global Health, and PubMed was performed and studies published between October 2015 and January 2020 were included. The search strategy was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, and AI-based investigations were mandatory for studies inclusion. The abstracts, titles, and full-texts of potentially eligible studies were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review; 18 met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of the evaluated AI screening systems in detecting diabetic retinopathy was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92-0.94) and the specificity was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.89). The included studies detailed training and external validation datasets, criteria for diabetic retinopathy case ascertainment, imaging modalities, DR-grading scales, and compared AI results to those of human graders (e.g., ophthalmologists, retinal specialists, trained nurses, and other healthcare providers) as a reference standard. The findings of this study showed that the majority AI screening systems demonstrated clinically acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus and OCT photographs. Further improvement depends on the continual development of novel algorithms with large and gradable sets of images for training and validation. If cost-effectiveness ratios can be optimized, AI can become a financially sustainable and clinically effective intervention that can be incorporated into the healthcare systems of low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) and geographically remote locations. Combining screening technologies with treatment interventions such as anti-VEGF therapy, acellular capillary laser treatment, and vitreoretinal surgery can lead to substantial reductions in the incidence of irreversible vision-loss due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","","",""

Materials and Methods We explore how various machine learning (ML) models and types of electronic health records (EHRs) can predict fast versus slow onset of neuropathy, nephropathy, ocular disease, or cardiovascular disease using only patient data collected prior to diabetes diagnosis. Results We find that optimized random forest models performed best to accurately predict the diagnosis of a diabetic complication, with the most effective model distinguishing between fast versus slow nephropathy (AUROC = 0.75). Using all data sets combined allowed for the highest model predictive performance, and social history or laboratory alone were most predictive. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model interpretation allowed for exploration of predictors of fast and slow complication diagnosis, including underlying biases present in the EHR. Patients in the fast group had more medical visits, incurring a potential informed decision bias. Discussion Our study is unique in the realm of ML studies as it leverages SHAP as a starting point to explore patient markers not routinely used in diabetes monitoring. A mix of both bias and biological processes is likely present in influencing a model’s ability to distinguish between groups. Conclusion Overall, model interpretation is a critical step in evaluating validity of a user-intended endpoint for a model when using EHR data, and predictors affected by bias and those driven by biologic processes should be equally recognized.","","",""

Currently, diabetes care is facing several challenges: the decreasing number of diabetologists, the increasing number of patients, the reduced time allowed for medical visits, the growing complexity of the disease both from the standpoints of clinical and patient care, the difficulty of achieving the relevant clinical targets, the growing burden of disease management for both the health care professional and the patient, and the health care accessibility and sustainability.

In this study, we look at this problem from the perspective of the forecasting of future glucose values for diabetic people. In this study, we propose the coherent mean squared glycemic error (gcMSE) loss function. It penalizes the model during its training not only of the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on dangerous regions. In order to use the loss function in practice, we propose an algorithm that progressively improves the clinical acceptability of the model, so that we can achieve the best tradeoff possible between accuracy and given clinical criteria. We evaluate the approaches using two diabetes datasets, one having type-1 patients and the other type-2 patients. The results show that using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the models. In particular, the improvements are significant in the hypoglycemia region. We also show that this increased clinical acceptability comes at the cost of a decrease in the average accuracy of the model. Finally, we show that this tradeoff between accuracy and clinical acceptability can be successfully addressed with the proposed algorithm. For given clinical criteria, the algorithm can find the optimal solution that maximizes the accuracy while at the same meeting the criteria.","","",""

The capability to detect diabetes early can improve the scope of disease management. For disease prognosis, artificial intelligence techniques are used widely. In this paper, probability and prediction for diabetes are discussed along with its model explanability and interpretability. A UCI repository's new diabetes dataset, which is collected from Bangladesh patients, is used. Various tools were used to interpret the model outcome, like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), tree-based model feature importance, partial dependency plots. A plethora of tree-based and other popular classification algorithms were used to build the diabetes prediction model. The findings indicated that using kernel-PCA before fitting random forest (RF) gives slightly better results than vanilla-RF. Our findings indicate a strong positive correlation with the 3Ps of diabetes, i.e., polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia, along with genital thrush, visual blurring, and delayed healing. Being a female in this dataset (derived from Bangladesh patients) have a high chance of diabetes. This represents the model's accuracy and reliability that eventually will be crucial in the trust of medical practitioners on the model outcome. The counter-intuitive outcome of individual data attributes was examined with model agnostic interpretability of machine learning techniques, which can be explained with domain knowledge of the data. The outcome also suggests that the model built on one domain, like population demographics, cannot be directly applied to other demographics. Any patterns observed in the data relevant to the model outcome should be well studied and explained, along with model accuracy metrics.","","",""

Methods A DLS with a convolutional neural network was developed to recognize fundus images of referable diabetic retinopathy. A total data set of 41,866 color fundus images were obtained from 17 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). Five experienced retinal specialists and 15 ophthalmologists were recruited to verify images. For training, 80% of the data set was used, and the other 20% served as the validation data set. To effectively understand the learning process, the DLS automatically superimposed a heatmap on the original image. The regions utilized by the DLS were highlighted for diagnosis. Results Using the local validation data set, the DLS achieved an area under the curve of 0.9824. Based on the manual screening criteria, an operating point was set at about 0.9 sensitivity to evaluate the DLS. Specificity was recorded at 0.9609 and sensitivity was 0.9003.

After analyzing the misclassification, it was found that 88.6% of the false-positives were mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) whereas, 81.6% of the false-negatives were intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. Conclusions The DLS efficiently detected fundus images from complex sources in the real world. Incorporating DLS technology in tele-screening will advance the current screening programs to offer a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for detecting diabetic retinopathy.","","",""

Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective management and preventing complications. Deep learning (DL) offers a powerful approach to analyzing medical data for improved DM detection and diagnosis. DL models can analyze retinal fundus images, electronic health records (EHRs), and wearable device data to identify early signs of DM and its complications. This enables earlier intervention, personalized risk stratification, and better clinical decision support. However, challenges like data availability, model interpretability, and clinical integration need to be addressed. Future directions in explainable AI (XAI) and federated learning hold promise for overcoming these challenges.

Minimally invasive methods are needed to prevent and control diabetes but most devices for measuring glucose levels are invasive and not amenable for continuous monitoring. Here, we present an alternative method to overcome these shortcomings based on non-invasive optical photoplethysmography (PPG) for detecting diabetes. We classify non-Diabetic and Diabetic patients using the PPG signal and metadata for training Logistic Regression (LR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. We used PPG signals from a publicly available dataset. To prevent overfitting, we divided the data into five folds for cross-validation. By ensuring that patients in the training set are not in the testing set, the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen subjects' data, providing a more accurate assessment of its generalization. Our model achieved an F1-Score and AUC of $58.8\pm20.0\%$ and $79.2\pm15.0\%$ for LR and $51.7\pm16.5\%$ and $73.6\pm17.0\%$ for XGBoost, respectively. Feature analysis suggested that PPG morphological features contains diabetes-related information alongside metadata. Our findings are within the same range reported in the literature, indicating that machine learning methods are promising for developing remote, non-invasive, and continuous measurement devices for detecting and preventing diabetes.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Uses AI to develop a DR detection algorithm; focuses on a single imaging modality and protocol development, not a review or multimodal analysis.","Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important causes of blindness worldwide, especially in developed countries. In diabetic patients, periodic examination of the back of the eye using a nonmydriatic camera has been widely demonstrated to be an effective system to control and prevent the onset of DR. Convolutional neural networks have been used to detect DR, achieving very high sensitivities and specificities. Objective: The objective of this is paper was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for the detection of signs of DR in diabetic patients and to scientifically validate the algorithm to be used as a screening tool in primary care. Methods: Under this project, 2 studies will be conducted in a concomitant way: (1) Development of an algorithm with AI to detect signs of DR in patients with diabetes and (2) A prospective study comparing the diagnostic capacity of the AI algorithm with respect to the actual system of family physicians evaluating the images. The standard reference to compare with will be a blinded double reading conducted by retina specialists. For the development of the AI algorithm, different iterations and workouts will be performed on the same set of data. Before starting each new workout, the strategy of dividing the set date into 2 groups will be used randomly. A group with 80% of the images will be used during the training (training dataset), and the remaining 20% images will be used to validate the results (validation dataset) of each cycle (epoch). During the prospective study, true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative values will be calculated again. From here, we will obtain the resulting confusion matrix and other indicators to measure the performance of the algorithm. Results: Cession of the images began at the end of 2018. The development of the AI algorithm is calculated to last about 3 to 4 months. Inclusion of patients in the cohort will start in early 2019 and is expected to last 3 to 4 months. Preliminary results are expected to be published by the end of 2019. Conclusions: The study will allow the development of an algorithm based on AI that can demonstrate an equal or superior performance, and that constitutes a complement or an alternative, to the current screening of DR in diabetic patients.

DR is a primary cause of blindness in working-age people and it is estimated that 3 to 4 million people with diabetes are blinded by DR every year worldwide. Early diagnosis have been considered an effective way to mitigate such problem. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to analyze the DR images generated by the fundus camera for automatically DR diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on identifying small lesions on DR fundus images. The results from our analysis, which include the lesion category and their exact locations in the image, can be used to facilitate the determination of DR severity (indicated by DR stages). Different from traditional object detection for natural images, lesion detection for fundus images have unique challenges. Specifically, the size of a lesion instance is usually very small, compared with the original resolution of the fundus images, making them diffcult to be detected. We analyze the lesion-vs-image scale carefully and propose a large-size feature pyramid network (LFPN) to preserve more image details for mini lesion instance detection. Our method includes an effective region proposal strategy to increase the sensitivity. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to the original feature pyramid network (FPN) method and Faster RCNN.","","",""

Major advances in diagnostics, technology and treatment have already revolutionized how we manage DR in the early part of the 21st century. For example, the accessibility of imaging with optical coherence tomography, and the development of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment are just some of the landmark developments that have shaped the DR landscape over the last few decades. Yet, there are still more exciting advances being made. Looking forward to 2030, many of these ongoing developments are likely to further transform the field. First, epidemiologic projections show that the global burden of DR is not only increasing, but also shifting from high-income countries towards middle- and low-income areas. Second, better understanding of disease pathophysiology is placing greater emphasis on retinal neural dysfunction and non-vascular aspects of diabetic retinal disease. Third, a wealth of information is becoming available from newer imaging modalities such as widefield imaging systems and optical coherence tomography angiography. Fourth, artificial intelligence for screening, diagnosis and prognostication of DR will become increasingly accessible and important. Fifth, new pharmacologic agents targeting other non-VEGF-driven pathways, and novel therapeutic strategies such as gene therapy are being developed for DR. Finally, the classification system for diabetic retinal disease will need to be continually updated to keep pace with new developments. In this article, we discuss these major trends in DR that we expect to see in 2030 and beyond.","","",""

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of automated screening systems for retinal image analysis. However, building robust models presents challenges due to inconsistencies in image acquisition, varying resolutions, and imbalanced class distributions. To address these issues, this research introduces a novel abnormality-aware attentive feature selection approach for classifying retinal images into three categories: healthy (H), glaucoma (G), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). This method focuses on extracting the most discriminative features to enhance classification performance. Additionally, we propose a cross-segmentation framework that extracts and integrates comprehensive multiview information-specifically, optic disc and vascular structures-from the input retinal images. By leveraging these supplementary features, our approach effectively addresses low inter-class variability and enriches the information available for accurate classification. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse publicly available datasets-including FIVES, Drishti-GS1, SUSTech, HRF, and PAPILA-demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 83% (95% CI: 80%-86%), with sensitivities of 0.81 for the healthy class, 0.81 for glaucoma, and 0.87 for diabetic retinopathy.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying similar principles of proportional representation to enhance interpretability in machine learning, specifically in Explainable AI (XAI). This study investigates the integration of D'Hondt-based voting principles in the DhondtXAI method, which leverages resource allocation concepts to interpret feature importance within AI models. Through a comparison of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and DhondtXAI, we evaluate their effectiveness in feature attribution within CatBoost and XGBoost models for breast cancer and diabetes prediction, respectively. The DhondtXAI approach allows for alliance formation and thresholding to enhance interpretability, representing feature importance as seats in a parliamentary view. Statistical correlation analyses between SHAP values and DhondtXAI allocations support the consistency of interpretations, demonstrating DhondtXAI's potential as a complementary tool for understanding feature importance in AI models. The results highlight that integrating electoral principles, such as proportional representation and alliances, into AI explainability can improve user understanding, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare.","","",""

It is a common complication of diabetes that can impact the eyes and lead to vision loss. One method for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy is the examination of the fundus of the eye. An ophthalmologist examines the back part of the eye, including the retina, optic nerve, and the blood vessels that supply the retina. In the case of diabetic retinopathy, the blood vessels in the retina deteriorate and can lead to bleeding, swelling, and other changes that affect vision. We proposed a method for detecting diabetic diabetic severity levels. First, a set of data-prerpocessing is applied to available data: adaptive equalisation, color normalisation, Gaussian filter, removal of the optic disc and blood vessels. Second, we perform image segmentation for relevant markers and extract features from the fundus images. Third, we apply an ensemble of classifiers and we assess the trust in the system.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Uses differential privacy to generate synthetic data for fairness audits, offering a novel privacy‑preserving fairness evaluation method, but does not address diabetes multimodal review or related modalities.","Fairness auditing of AI systems can identify and quantify biases. However, traditional auditing using real-world data raises security and privacy concerns. It exposes auditors to security risks as they become custodians of sensitive information and targets for cyberattacks. Privacy risks arise even without direct breaches, as data analyses can inadvertently expose confidential information. To address these, we propose a framework that leverages differentially private synthetic data to audit the fairness of AI systems. By applying privacy-preserving mechanisms, it generates synthetic data that mirrors the statistical properties of the original dataset while ensuring privacy. This method balances the goal of rigorous fairness auditing and the need for strong privacy protections. Through experiments on real datasets like Adult, COMPAS, and Diabetes, we compare fairness metrics of synthetic and real data. By analyzing the alignment and discrepancies between these metrics, we assess the capacity of synthetic data to preserve the fairness properties of real data. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to enable meaningful fairness evaluations while safeguarding sensitive information, proving its applicability across critical and sensitive domains.","","",""

Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore, early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial for diabetes-burdened regions.","","",""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance.

We have attempted to replicate the main method in 'Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs' published in JAMA 2016; 316(22). We re-implemented the method since the source code is not available, and we used publicly available data sets. The original study used non-public fundus images from EyePACS and three hospitals in India for training. We used a different EyePACS data set from Kaggle. The original study used the benchmark data set Messidor-2 to evaluate the algorithm's performance. We used the same data set. In the original study, ophthalmologists re-graded all images for diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and image gradability. There was one diabetic retinopathy grade per image for our data sets, and we assessed image gradability ourselves. Hyper-parameter settings were not described in the original study. But some of these were later published. We were not able to replicate the original study. Our algorithm's area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the Kaggle EyePACS test set and 0.80 on Messidor-2 did not come close to the reported AUC of 0.99 in the original study. This may be caused by the use of a single grade per image, different data, or different not described hyper-parameter settings. This study shows the challenges of replicating deep learning, and the need for more replication studies to validate deep learning methods, especially for medical image analysis.

  Methods A deep learning framework was trained to grade the images automatically. A large representative set of 7000 color fundus images were used for the experiment which were obtained from the EyePACS that were made available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis experts were employed to categorize these images into Accept and Reject classes based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR.

For most persons living with T1D, the determination of insulin delivery is based on a single measured parameter—glucose. To date, wearable sensors exist that enable the seamless, noninvasive, and low-cost monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. Objective The objective of this literature survey is to explore whether some of the physiological parameters that can be monitored with noninvasive, wearable sensors may be used to enhance T1D management. Methods A list of physiological parameters, which can be monitored by using wearable sensors available in 2020, was compiled by a thorough review of the devices available in the market. A literature survey was performed using search terms related to T1D combined with the identified physiological parameters. The selected publications were restricted to human studies, which had at least their abstracts available. The PubMed and Scopus databases were interrogated. In total, 77 articles were retained and analyzed based on the following two axes: the reported relations between these parameters and T1D, which were found by comparing persons with T1D and healthy control participants, and the potential areas for T1D enhancement via the further analysis of the found relationships in studies working within T1D cohorts. Results On the basis of our search methodology, 626 articles were returned, and after applying our exclusion criteria, 77 (12.3%) articles were retained. Physiological parameters with potential for monitoring by using noninvasive wearable devices in persons with T1D included those related to cardiac autonomic function, cardiorespiratory control balance and fitness, sudomotor function, and skin temperature. Cardiac autonomic function measures, particularly the indices of heart rate and heart rate variability, have been shown to be valuable in diagnosing and monitoring cardiac autonomic neuropathy and, potentially, predicting and detecting hypoglycemia. All identified physiological parameters were shown to be associated with some aspects of diabetes complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, as well as macrovascular disease, with capacity for early risk prediction. However, although they can be monitored by available wearable sensors, most studies have yet to adopt them, as opposed to using more conventional devices. Conclusions Wearable sensors have the potential to augment T1D sensing with additional, informative biomarkers, which can be monitored noninvasively, seamlessly, and continuously. However, significant challenges associated with measurement accuracy, removal of noise and motion artifacts, and smart decision-making exist. Consequently, research should focus on harvesting the information hidden in the complex data generated by wearable sensors and on developing models and smart decision strategies to optimize the incorporation of these novel inputs into T1D interventions.","","",""

Early detection and intervention can prevent blindness; however, many patients do not receive their recommended annual diabetic eye examinations, primarily owing to limited access. Objective To evaluate the safety and accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) system (the EyeArt Automated DR Detection System, version 2.1.0) in detecting both more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy (mtmDR) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (vtDR). Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective multicenter cross-sectional diagnostic study was preregistered (NCT03112005) and conducted from April 17, 2017, to May 30, 2018. A total of 942 individuals aged 18 years or older who had diabetes gave consent to participate at 15 primary care and eye care facilities. Data analysis was performed from February 14 to July 10, 2019. Interventions Retinal imaging for the autonomous AI system and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) reference standard determination. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome measures included the sensitivity and specificity of the AI system in identifying participants’ eyes with mtmDR and/or vtDR by 2-field undilated fundus photography vs a rigorous clinical reference standard comprising reading center grading of 4 wide-field dilated images using the ETDRS severity scale. Secondary outcome measures included the evaluation of imageability, dilated-if-needed analysis, enrichment correction analysis, worst-case imputation, and safety outcomes. Results Of 942 consenting individuals, 893 patients (1786 eyes) met the inclusion criteria and completed the study protocol. The population included 449 men (50.3%). Mean (SD) participant age was 53.9 (15.2) years (median, 56; range, 18-88 years), 655 were White (73.3%), and 206 had type 1 diabetes (23.1%). Sensitivity and specificity of the AI system were high in detecting mtmDR (sensitivity: 95.5%; 95% CI, 92.4%-98.5% and specificity: 85.0%; 95% CI, 82.6%-87.4%) and vtDR (sensitivity: 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.1%-100% and specificity: 89.0%; 95% CI, 87.0%-91.1%) without dilation. Imageability was high without dilation, with the AI system able to grade 87.4% (95% CI, 85.2%-89.6%) of the eyes with reading center grades. When eyes with ungradable results were dilated per the protocol, the imageability improved to 97.4% (95% CI, 96.4%-98.5%), with the sensitivity and specificity being similar. After correcting for enrichment, the mtmDR specificity increased to 87.8% (95% CI, 86.3%-89.5%) and the sensitivity remained similar; for vtDR, both sensitivity (97.0%; 95% CI, 91.2%-100%) and specificity (90.1%; 95% CI, 89.4%-91.5%) improved. Conclusions and Relevance This prospective multicenter cross-sectional diagnostic study noted safety and accuracy with use of the EyeArt Automated DR Detection System in detecting both mtmDR and, for the first time, vtDR, without physician assistance. These findings suggest that improved access to accurate, reliable diabetic eye examinations may increase adherence to recommended annual screenings and allow for accelerated referral of patients identified as having vtDR.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Discusses AI democratization in medicine, but lacks any diabetes‑specific content, multimodal data, or technical challenges; only the democratization link is loosely applicable.","Artificial intelligence will transform medicine. One particularly attractive possibility is the democratization of medical expertise. If black-box medical algorithms can be trained to match the performance of high-level human experts — to identify malignancies as well as trained radiologists, to diagnose diabetic retinopathy as well as board-certified ophthalmologists, or to recommend tumor-specific courses of treatment as well as top-ranked oncologists — then those algorithms could be deployed in medical settings where human experts are not available, and patients could benefit. 

But there is a problem with this vision. Privacy law, malpractice, insurance reimbursement, and FDA approval standards all encourage developers to train medical AI in high-resource contexts, such as academic medical centers. And put simply, care is different in high-resource settings than it is in low-resource settings such as community health centers or rural providers in less-developed countries. Patient populations differ, as do the resources available to administer treatment and the resources available to pay for that treatment. This development pattern will lead to decreases in the quality of the algorithm’s recommendations, reflected in problematic care and increased costs. Perniciously, such quality problems in low-resource contexts are likely to go unrecognized for exactly the same reasons that promote algorithmic training in high-resource contexts.

Solutions are not trivial. Labeling products the same way that drugs are labeled is unlikely to work, and truly addressing the problem may require a combination of public investment in data to train medical AI and regulatory requirements for cross-context validation. Nevertheless, if black-box medicine is to achieve its goal of bringing excellent medicine to broad sets of patients, the problem of contextual bias should be recognized and addressed sooner rather than later.","","",""

Subtle distinction among different grades and existence of many significant small features make the task of recognition very challenging.

Automated detection of diabetic retinopathy is essential to tackle these problems. Early-stage detection of diabetic retinopathy is also very important for diagnosis, which can prevent blindness with proper treatment. In this paper, we developed a novel deep convolutional neural network, which performs the early-stage detection by identifying all microaneurysms (MAs), the first signs of DR, along with correctly assigning labels to retinal fundus images which are graded into five categories.

After training on and testing all the classification models, the proposed system provided the best result in the XGBoost classifier with the ADASYN approach with 81% accuracy, 0.81 F1 coefficient and AUC of 0.84. Furthermore, the domain adaptation method has been implemented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed system. The explainable AI approach with LIME and SHAP frameworks is implemented to understand how the model predicts the final results. Finally, a website framework and an Android smartphone application have been developed to input various features and predict diabetes instantaneously.

- **Reasoning:** Uses self‑supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation for DR detection on EyePACS and Messidor‑2; only retinal imaging focus, no multimodal review or broader diabetes AI topics.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the working-age population of developed countries, caused by a side effect of diabetes that reduces the blood supply to the retina. Deep neural networks have been widely used in automated systems for DR classification on eye fundus images. However, these models need a large number of annotated images. In the medical domain, annotations from experts are costly, tedious, and time-consuming; as a result, a limited number of annotated images are available. This paper presents a semi-supervised method that leverages unlabeled images and labeled ones to train a model that detects diabetic retinopathy. The proposed method uses unsupervised pretraining via self-supervised learning followed by supervised fine-tuning with a small set of labeled images and knowledge distillation to increase the performance in classification task. This method was evaluated on the EyePACS test and Messidor-2 dataset achieving 0.94 and 0.89 AUC respectively using only 2% of EyePACS train labeled images.","","",""

Existing methods rely heavily on manual annotation or training-intensive deep learning models that lack generalizability. Here we report RADAR. This is an annotation-free computational framework for the 3D segmentation and quantification of optical coherence tomography angiography data. The pipeline integrates adaptive physics-aware denoising with topology-preserving centerline extraction to reconstruct complex networks without manual labeling. We validated the framework in healthy individuals and patients with early-stage diabetic retinopathy. The method outperformed standard segmentation tools and resolved layer-specific morphological alterations obscured in conventional two-dimensional projections. Quantitative analysis revealed distinct patterns of compensatory remodeling and increased tortuosity in diabetic eyes. RADAR enables precise extraction of volumetric biomarkers including vessel length and branching complexity. It provides a scalable tool for early detection and longitudinal assessment of ocular and systemic vascular diseases.","","",""

This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for the automated classification of retinal images into four categories: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma. The dataset was compiled from publicly available retinal imaging databases, including IDRiD and HRF. Four convolutional neural network architectures-EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B7, a build-from-scratch model, and AlexNet-were evaluated using multiple performance metrics. Among these, AlexNet achieved the highest overall performance, attaining an accuracy of 93.65%, sensitivity of 94.39%, specificity of 98.05%, PPV of 93.65%, NPV of 97.95%, and an F1-score of 93.74%. EfficientNet-B7 followed with an accuracy of 92.82%, confirming the strength of transfer learning in retinal feature extraction. A five-fold cross-validation further validated AlexNet's robustness, yielding a mean R2 of 0.8891 with low variance, indicating consistent generalization across folds. Computational efficiency analysis showed that AlexNet achieved high diagnostic accuracy with a moderate processing time of approximately 14 minutes. Model interpretability using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that AlexNet highlighted clinically relevant retinal regions, such as the optic disc and macula, thereby enhancing transparency and clinical trust. In summary, the proposed framework demonstrates that interpretable deep learning models can deliver accurate, consistent, and explainable retinal disease classification, offering a foundation for real-time, AI-assisted ophthalmic screening systems.","","",""

This review evaluates the current landscape and future potential of AID systems without meal announcement, particularly focusing on real-world insights from open-source AID (OS-AID) technologies. Although commercial AID systems operating in hybrid closed-loop (HCL) mode have improved glycaemic outcomes, they remain dependent on manual meal announcement and user-driven actions, limiting their real-world utility. Current versions of OS-AID systems, developed by the diabetes community, can allow operation without meal announcements, presenting an opportunity to move closer to truly automated diabetes management. Recent clinical trials suggest that OS-AID systems can effectively manage glucose levels without meal announcements, achieving glucose levels comparable with those obtained by AID systems in HCL mode, with the potential of reduced management burden for users. However, practical challenges persist, including the need for expert configuration and handling of rapid changes in insulin sensitivity, such as during exercise or rapid glucose fluctuations following predicted low-glucose. This review synthesises insights from user and healthcare professional experiences, and emerging clinical evidence. It highlights the fact that successful implementation of AID without meal announcement requires advanced algorithmic responsiveness, user personalisation and ongoing clinician engagement. Looking forward, integrating adjunctive therapies, artificial intelligence and enhanced physiological modelling will likely enhance system performance to drive the next generation of diabetes care towards wider adoption and true 'set-and-forget' functionality.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Uses attribution methods to explain OCT-based DR detection; focuses on method comparison, not a multimodal diabetes review, and lacks broader AI/ML, wearable, CGM, or deployment discussions.","Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables early detection of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR) and retinal fluid accumulation, both major complications of diabetes. Despite high classification performance, deep learning models face limited clinical adoption due to poor interpretability. While attribution methods are effective for explaining predictions in the natural image domain, their applicability to medical imaging remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, our work explores how well these strong results transfer to the medical imaging domain. This study evaluates three cutting-edge attribution methods- DeepLIFT, AGI, and AttEXplore -for explaining predictions of a VGG16-based deep learning model in DR classification using widefield OCTA en face images and fluid detection in OCT B-scans. We assess attribution methods' ability to highlight clinically relevant regions using quantitative (insertion and deletion scores) and qualitative (heatmap visual analysis) measures. Although the VGG16 model achieves high classification accuracy (94% for DR and 98% for fluid), attribution methods yield markedly different qualitative results due to variations in underlying assumptions and hyperparameter sensitivity. Additionally, high insertion or low deletion scores do not necessarily correlate with clinically meaningful visual attributions. In particular, insertion- and deletion-based behaviour can be more informative in pathological cases, where localized lesions can drive predictions, but tends to be less informative in normal cases, where confirming the absence of pathology requires global contextual evidence. Comparing the three approaches, we find that AGI and AttEXplore achieve similarly strong quantitative performance, whereas AttEXplore more consistently highlights clinically meaningful structures in pathological cases than AGI and DeepLIFT, making it the preferred option in our DR and fluid detection settings. However, our results also show that in any potential clinical usage, all three methods must be interpreted alongside clinical expertise, and even the result of the best-performing attribution approach cannot serve as an automatic proxy for clinical relevance. This study provides critical insights into challenges of applying attribution methods to medical imaging, using ophthalmic data, laying a foundation for improving transparency and trust in AI-assisted diagnostics.","","",""

Gold Standard Science supports open science by emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and the use of best practices that enable others to verify and extend research. Pairing a research article's cited data snapshot with a versioned, environment-specific code release, deposited in a companion code repository, ensures that, upon submission to a medical journal, readers and reviewers can directly verify results. An executable and updatable companion code repository complements, rather than replaces, established research data repositories. When code underlying medical research results is made openly available, then other scientists can inspect, run, and validate analyses. These activities enhance reproducibility, which is a core aim of GSS. Shared code also facilitates collaborative innovation by allowing researchers to extend the utility of the code to new datasets and applications. For researchers, code sharing can increase visibility, credibility, and citation impact. Demonstrating transparency through shared executable and updatable code builds trust with journal readers, peer reviewers, funders, and peers.

Intraretinal (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF) detection and volumes, external limiting-membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) integrity, and hyperreflective retina foci (HRF) quantification were analyzed. Three-hundred three DME eyes were included. The mean central subfield thickness was 386.5 ± 130.2 µm. IRF was present in all eyes and confirmed by AI software. The agreement (kappa value) (95% confidence interval) for SRF presence and ELM and EZ interruption were 0.831 (0.738–0.924), 0.934 (0.886–0.982), and 0.936 (0.894–0.977), respectively. The accuracy of the automatic quantification of IRF, SRF, ELM, and EZ ranged between 94.7% and 95.7%, while accuracy of quality parameters ranged between 99.0% (OCT layer segmentation) and 100.0% (fovea centering). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient between clinical and automated HRF count was excellent (0.97).

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.","","",""

Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed for most patients later on in life whereas the less common Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed early on in life. People can live healthy and happy lives while living with diabetes, but early detection produces a better overall outcome on most patient's health. Thus, to test the accurate prediction of Type 2 diabetes, we use the patients' information from an electronic health records company called Practice Fusion, which has about 10,000 patient records from 2009 to 2012. This data contains individual key biometrics, including age, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, gender, height, and weight. We use this data on popular machine learning algorithms and for each algorithm, we evaluate the performance of every model based on their classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity/recall, negative predictive value, and F1 score. In our study, we find that all algorithms other than Naive Bayes suffered from very low precision. Hence, we take a step further and incorporate all the algorithms into a weighted average or soft voting ensemble model where each algorithm will count towards a majority vote towards the decision outcome of whether a patient has diabetes or not. The accuracy of the Ensemble model on Practice Fusion is 85\%, by far our ensemble approach is new in this space. We firmly believe that the weighted average ensemble model not only performed well in overall metrics but also helped to recover wrong predictions and aid in accurate prediction of Type 2 diabetes. Our accurate novel model can be used as an alert for the patients to seek medical evaluation in time.","","",""

Early detection of diabetic complications is crucial for initiating fast medical reactions and improving patient outcomes. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has great promise in predicting disease courses, its clinical usage has been limited by the absence of interpretability. This study aims to build Explainable AI (XAI)-PREDICT, an AI-based predictive tool for the early detection of diabetic complications in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health records from 12 hospitals in Saudi Arabia, tracking 87,542 patients with diabetes mellitus from January 2021 to January 2025. Five major diabetic complications were predicted using many machine learning models built and assessed over 24 months. Interpretability components were included in model development, considering situational variables particular to Saudi medical institutions. The final XAI-PREDICT system achieved high predictive accuracy with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87–0.91) for nephropathy, 0.86 (95% CI: 0.84–0.88) for retinopathy, 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.86) for neuropathy, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86–0.90) for cardiovascular occasions and 91 (95% CI: 0.89–0.93) for diabetic foot. Using AI to control diabetes in Saudi Arabia has advanced significantly with XAI-PREDICT. It provides both a useful interpretation and great predictive power. This study shows the importance of using XAI-PREDICT for early detection, management of complications and lowering the burden of complications. ","","",""

This research employs parallel and sequential ensemble ML approaches paired with feature selection techniques to boost classification accuracy. The Pima India Diabetes Data from the UCI ML Repository served as the dataset. Data preprocessing included cleaning the dataset by replacing missing values with column means and selecting highly correlated features using forward and backward selection methods. The dataset was split into two parts: training (70%), and testing (30%). Python was used for classification in Jupyter Notebook, and there were two design phases. The first phase utilized J48, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Decision Stump (DS) to create a random forest model. The second phase employed the same algorithms alongside sequential ensemble methods—XG Boost, AdaBoostM1, and Gradient Boosting—using an average voting algorithm for binary classification. Evaluation revealed that XG Boost, AdaBoostM1, and Gradient Boosting achieved classification accuracies of 100%, with performance metrics including F1 score, MCC, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC, and AUC-PR all equal to 1.00, indicating reliable predictions of diabetes presence.

However, accurate diagnosis depends on multimodal imaging and the expertise of retinal ophthalmologists.
Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model to detect treatment-requiring retinal vascular diseases using multimodal imaging.
Methods: This retrospective study enrolled participants with multimodal ophthalmic imaging data from 3 hospitals in Taiwan from 2013 to 2019. Eye-related images were used, including those obtained through retinal fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography with or without indocyanine green angiography (FA/ICGA). A deep learning model was constructed for detecting DME, nAMD, mCNV, BRVO, and CRVO and identifying treatment-requiring diseases. Model performance was evaluated and is presented as the area under the curve (AUC) for each receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: A total of 2992 eyes of 2185 patients were studied, with 239, 1209, 1008, 211, 189, and 136 eyes in the control, DME, nAMD, mCNV, BRVO, and CRVO groups, respectively. Among them, 1898 eyes required treatment. The eyes were divided into training, validation, and testing groups in a 5:1:1 ratio. In total, 5117 retinal fundus photos, 9316 OCT images, and 20,922 FA/ICGA images were used. The AUCs for detecting mCNV, DME, nAMD, BRVO, and CRVO were 0.996, 0.995, 0.990, 0.959, and 0.988, respectively. The AUC for detecting treatment-requiring diseases was 0.969. From the heat maps, we observed that the model could identify retinal vascular diseases.
Conclusions: Our study developed a deep learning model to detect retinal diseases using multimodal ophthalmic imaging. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good performance in detecting treatment-requiring retinal diseases.","","",""

Simplicity bias can lead to the model making biased predictions which have poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To address this, we propose a framework that encourages the model to use a more diverse set of features to make predictions. We first train a simple model, and then regularize the conditional mutual information with respect to it to obtain the final model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in various problem settings and real-world applications, showing that it effectively addresses simplicity bias and leads to more features being used, enhances OOD generalization, and improves subgroup robustness and fairness.

The discovery of insulin in 1921 transformed the landscape of diabetes treatment and was followed by the discovery of several new therapies which improved glycemia and increased patient life span. However, as patients with diabetes lived longer, they developed classic microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications. In the 1990s, the DCCT and the UKPDS trials demonstrated that tight glucose control reduced the microvascular complications of diabetes, but had marginal effects on cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. In 2008, the FDA directed that all new diabetes medications demonstrate cardiovascular safety. From this recommendation emerged novel therapeutic classes, the GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2-Inhibitors, which not only improve glycemia, but also provide robust cardio-renal protection. In parallel, developments in diabetes technology like continuous glucose monitoring systems, insulin pumps, telemedicine and precision medicine have advanced diabetes management. Remarkably, a century later, insulin remains a cornerstone of diabetes treatment. Also, diet and physical activity remain important components of any diabetes treatment. Today type 2 diabetes is preventable and long-term remission of diabetes is possible. Finally, progress continues in the field of islet transplantation, perhaps the ultimate frontier in diabetes management. ","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Presents a novel LSTM multitask model for personalized glucose prediction; focuses on a single method and OhioT1DM dataset, without reviewing multimodal data, wearables, imaging, or broader AI/ML challenges.","The adverse glycemic events triggered by the inaccurate insulin infusion in Type I diabetes (T1D) can lead to fatal complications. Predicting blood glucose concentration (BGC) based on clinical health records is critical for control algorithms in the artificial pancreas (AP) and aiding in medical decision support. This paper presents a novel deep learning (DL) model incorporating multitask learning (MTL) for personalized blood glucose prediction. The network architecture consists of shared and clustered hidden layers. Two layers of stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) form the shared hidden layers that learn generalized features from all subjects. The clustered hidden layers comprise two dense layers adapting to the gender-specific variability in the data. Finally, the subject-specific dense layers offer additional fine-tuning to personalized glucose dynamics resulting in an accurate BGC prediction at the output. OhioT1DM clinical dataset is used for the training and performance evaluation of the proposed model. A detailed analytical and clinical assessment have been performed using root mean square (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Clarke error grid analysis (EGA), respectively, which demonstrates the robustness and reliability of the proposed method. Consistently leading performance has been achieved for 30- (RMSE = 16.06 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 2.74, MAE = 10.64 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 1.35), 60- (RMSE = 30.89 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 4.31, MAE = 22.07 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 2.96), 90- (RMSE = 40.51 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 5.16, MAE = 30.16 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 4.10), and 120-minute (RMSE = 47.39 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 5.62, MAE = 36.36 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 4.54) prediction horizon (PH). In addition, the EGA analysis confirms the clinical feasibility by maintaining more than 94% BGC predictions in the clinically safe zone for up to 120-minute PH. Moreover, the improvement is established by benchmarking against the state-of-the-art statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) methods.","","",""

Survey results were analyzed quantitatively (p-value = 0.05).In total 216 students (37% response rate) participated. The median AI knowledge score was 11 (interquartile range 4), and the maximum possible score was 25. The score was higher among final year students (p = 0.006) and among those with additional training in AI (p = 0.040). Over 49% strongly agreed or agreed that AI will reduce the number of jobs for doctors. Many expect AI to impact their specialty choice, felt the Nepalese health-care system is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of AI, and opined every student of medicine should receive training on AI competencies.The lack of coverage of AI and machine learning in Nepalese medical schools has resulted in students being unaware of AI's impact on individual patients and the healthcare system. A high perceived willingness among respondents to learn about AI is a positive sign and a strong indicator of futuristic successful curricula changes. Systematic implementation of AI in the Nepalese healthcare system can be a potential tool in addressing health-care challenges related to resource and manpower constraints.

However, human + AI teams have been shown to perform worse than AI alone, with evidence indicating automation bias as the reason for poorer performance, particularly because humans tend to follow AI's recommendations even when they are incorrect. In many existing human + AI systems, decision-making support is typically provided in the form of text explanations (XAI) to help users understand the AI's reasoning. Since human decision-making often relies on System 1 thinking, users may ignore or insufficiently engage with the explanations, leading to poor decision-making. Previous research suggests that there is a need for new approaches that encourage users to engage with the explanations and one proposed method is the use of cognitive forcing functions (CFFs). In this work, we examine how various decision-support mechanisms impact user engagement, trust, and human-AI collaborative task performance in a diabetes management decision-making scenario. In a controlled experiment with 108 participants, we evaluated the effects of six decision-support mechanisms split into two categories of explanations (text, visual) and four CFFs. Our findings reveal that mechanisms like AI confidence levels, text explanations, and performance visualizations enhanced human-AI collaborative task performance, and improved trust when AI reasoning clues were provided. Mechanisms like human feedback and AI-driven questions encouraged deeper reflection but often reduced task performance by increasing cognitive effort, which in turn affected trust. Simple mechanisms like visual explanations had little effect on trust, highlighting the importance of striking a balance in CFF and XAI design.","","",""

Clinical trials' results provide the basis for guidance and support for official protocols that clinicians use to base their decisions. However, individuals do not consistently demonstrate the reported response from relevant clinical trials. The decision complexity increases with combination treatments where drugs administered together can interact with each other, which is often the case. Additionally, the individual's response to the treatment varies with the changes in their condition. In practice, the drug and the dose selection depend significantly on the medical protocol and the medical team's experience. As such, the results are inherently varied and often suboptimal. Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have emerged as excellent decision-making tools, but multiple challenges limit their application. AI is a rapidly evolving and dynamic field with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life. AI has become increasingly crucial in drug discovery and development. AI enhances decision-making across different disciplines, such as medicinal chemistry, molecular and cell biology, pharmacology, pathology, and clinical practice. In addition to these, AI contributes to patient population selection and stratification. The need for AI in healthcare is evident as it aids in enhancing data accuracy and ensuring the quality care necessary for effective patient treatment. AI is pivotal in improving success rates in clinical practice. The increasing significance of AI in drug discovery, development, and clinical trials is underscored by many scientific publications. Despite the numerous advantages of AI, such as enhancing and advancing Precision Medicine (PM) and remote patient monitoring, unlocking its full potential in healthcare requires addressing fundamental concerns. These concerns include data quality, the lack of well-annotated large datasets, data privacy and safety issues, biases in AI algorithms, legal and ethical challenges, and obstacles related to cost and implementation. Nevertheless, integrating AI in clinical medicine will improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, contribute to more efficient healthcare delivery, reduce costs, and facilitate better patient experiences, making healthcare more sustainable.

So I set out to find out. My research tells me AI and machine learning or machine intelligence are terms used in computer science for ‘intelligence’ demonstrated by machines like computers, as opposed to the ‘natural intelligence’ of humans and some other animals and birds (Fig. 1). The concept of intelligent machines was considered and described by science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov before they became real. Mary Shelley, daughter of feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley, started writing Frankenstein, the story of an artificial being, in 1815 when she was only 18. Douglas Adams invented an Electric Monk which believed things for you in order to save you the bother of believing everything the world expected you to believe. The word intelligent comes from the Latin intelligere, meaning to understand. Is a computer that beats a chess grandmaster actually intelligent or just well programmed? Alan Turing, the brilliant English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II breaking German ciphers, whose work led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain, suggested a better question was not whether a machine was intelligent, but whether machines could exhibit intelligent behaviour. Incidentally, despite being a war hero, Turing was prosecuted for ‘gross indecency’ for the then crime of being homosexual and was ‘chemically castrated’. In 1954, at age 41, Turing died after taking cyanide. In 2009, the British Parliament pardoned Turing and apologised to him for having persecuted him. In 1956, a young mathematician John McCarthy organised a workshop on thinking machines at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. He proposed a 2-month, 10-man study of ‘artificial intelligence’, the first ever use of the term. People came and went at the workshop. Rather wonderfully, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Enthusiasm for AI waxed and waned. The late 1970s when funding was withdrawn were called the ‘AI winter’, but that winter of discontent has matured into a burgeoning springtime of AI use, including in multiple areas of health care. AI is more than just computerising tasks; it builds on and develops computing capabilities. AI is about how machines ‘learn’ the associations between things by being repeatedly exposed to data. They are agnostic as to whether or not those associations make a priori sense or are logical. AI is increasingly being used in diagnosis, treatment and research. In dermatology, AI systems get feedback data from scanned skin biopsies and gradually improve their diagnostic accuracy based on the data, although systems are not yet sufficiently reliable to be used as the exclusive determinant of which skin lesions need biopsy. Computer technology is being used in pharmacies to assist with drug dosing and even with choice of drugs. One use in research is to aid in sample-size determination. On a positive note, if reliable, AI applications have enormous potential to improve information use in resource poor settings. A literature search for AI yields lots of articles on robots. Although there is no universally agreed definition of AI, most experts agree that a robot that simply automates a task is not AI, because AI involves significant learning. Current robotic surgery has a master–slave basis; true artificially intelligent robotic surgery is still a way off. Surgeons are rapidly training themselves in using robot-assisted (minimally invasive) surgery to operate on adults with proven or suspected malignancy, gynaecological problems including tubal sterilisation, and prostatic hypertrophy. There is less use of robots in children, although there are reports of paediatric robot-assisted surgery being used to perform pyeloplasty in the USA and to treat solid tumours in the UK, albeit with little or no evaluation as yet of the advantages and disadvantages. The names are great. The main US robotic surgical system is called the da Vinci Surgical System, a fitting tribute to the 16th century polymath, vegetarian, liberator of caged birds, so beloved of paediatricians (Fig. 2). A robot soothingly named Calmer is better at reducing pain in neonates than ‘facilitated tucking’. Robots are increasingly being used for the rehabilitation and education of children with disability, although research seems to Fig. 1 Artwork showing Jjaibot, an artificial intelligence robot capable of detecting human emotions such as anger, joy and happiness. doi:10.1111/jpc.14828","","",""

Drawing on formative patient grounding and a dimension-based physician evaluation, we examine AI responses along five quality dimensions: Accuracy, Safety, Clarity, Integrity, and Action Orientation. Our findings reveal that while current systems perform well in factual explanation and general lifestyle guidance, they frequently break down in safety signaling, contextual judgment, and responsibility boundaries, particularly when fluent responses invite overtrust.

This integration of various types and data models holds paramount importance as it enables the provision of detailed and precise information for diagnosing eye and vision diseases. By leveraging multi-modal ophthalmology AI techniques, clinicians can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses, and thus reduce the risks associated with misdiagnosis and oversight while also enabling more precise management of eye and vision health. However, the widespread adoption of multi-modal ophthalmology poses significant challenges.

Given these complex and dynamic factors, machine learning approaches can be leveraged for prediction of glucose trends in the hospital to mitigate and prevent suboptimal hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic outcomes. Our aim was to review the clinical evidence for the role of machine learning–based models in predicting hospitalized patients’ glucose trajectory. The published literature on machine learning algorithms has varied in terms of population studied, outcomes of interest, and validation methods. There have been tools developed that utilize data from both continuous glucose monitors and large electronic health records (EHRs). With increasing sample sizes, inclusion of a greater number of predictor variables, and use of more advanced machine learning algorithms, there has been a trend in recent years towards increasing predictive accuracy for glycemic outcomes in the hospital setting. While current models predicting glucose trajectory offer promising results, they have not been tested prospectively in the clinical setting. Accurate machine learning algorithms have been developed and validated for prediction of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the hospital. Further work is needed in implementation/integration of machine learning models into EHR systems, with prospective studies to evaluate effectiveness and safety of such clinical decision support on glycemic and other clinical outcomes.

However, in high-value, sensitive, or safety-critical applications such as self-management for personalized health or food recommendation with a specific purpose (e.g., allergy-aware recipe recommendations), their adoption is unlikely. Firstly, the AI system needs to follow guidelines or well-defined processes set by experts; the data alone will not be adequate. For example, to diagnose the severity of depression, mental healthcare providers use Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). So if an AI system were to be used for diagnosis, the medical guideline implied by the PHQ-9 needs to be used. Likewise, a nutritionist's knowledge and steps would need to be used for an AI system that guides a diabetic patient in developing a food plan. Second, the BlackBox nature typical of many current AI systems will not work; the user of an AI system will need to be able to give user-understandable explanations, explanations constructed using concepts that humans can understand and are familiar with. This is the key to eliciting confidence and trust in the AI system. For such applications, in addition to data and domain knowledge, the AI systems need to have access to and use the Process Knowledge, an ordered set of steps that the AI system needs to use or adhere to.","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on Medios AI retinal screening in oncology patients; does not address diabetes, wearables, CGM, multimodal fusion, or related AI/ML challenges.","Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into ophthalmic diagnostics, offering potential for efficient screening of common retinal diseases. The Medios AI system by Remidio (Singapore, Singapore), designed for use with a smartphone-based fundus camera, claims to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and glaucoma. However, its performance in complex clinical settings such as ocular oncology remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate both the diagnostic capabilities and limitations of the Medios AI system when applied to a diverse cohort of oncology patients. Materials and methods An observational study was conducted over three months in an ocular oncology clinic. Ninety-eight cancer patients (196 eyes) underwent fundus photography using the Remidio smartphone-based fundus imaging system. The images were analyzed using the Medios AI algorithm. AI-generated findings were compared with clinical evaluations by an experienced ophthalmologist to identify diagnostic concordance and discrepancies. Additional attention was paid to the system's imaging capabilities, including its ability to capture wide-field or montage images. Result The AI system accurately identified glaucomatous cupping in three patients, flagged two cases of DR, and detected signs of ARMD in two patients-all consistent with clinical examination. However, eight patients with leukemic retinopathy were incorrectly flagged as having DR, revealing a lack of specificity in distinguishing vascular retinal pathologies. The system also failed to detect optic atrophy, a critical neuro-ophthalmic finding in oncology patients. A technical limitation was also noted: the inability of the Remidio system to generate montage or wide-field images, restricting visualization of the peripheral retina. Conclusion While the Medios AI system demonstrates promise in identifying common retinal pathologies such as DR, ARMD, and glaucoma, its limitations are significant in the oncology context. The inability to distinguish similar hemorrhagic retinopathies, failure to detect optic nerve atrophy, and lack of wide-field imaging capabilities underscore the need for cautious implementation. Integration of AI tools must be accompanied by expert clinical oversight, especially in specialized settings where retinal presentations are complex and atypical.","","",""

A Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel performed best for predicting diabetes, returning a Brier score of 0.0654 and an AUROC of 0.9235 on the test set. An elastic net regression performed best for predicting undiagnosed diabetes with a Brier score of 0.0294 and an AUROC of 0.9439 on the test set. Similar features appear prominently in the models for both sets of models. Blood osmolality, family history, the prevalance of various compounds, and hypertension are key indicators for all diabetes risk.

Objective: This study highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition, this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health outcomes and disease burden attributable to Diabetes on healthcare systems","","",""

This study aimed to explore MYO1C as both a candidate biomarker and elucidate its role as a mechanistic mediator of podocyte injury in T2DN. Using urinary extracellular vesicle RNA biomarkers identified from a training and validation cohort of 33 type 2 diabetes and 40 T2DN patients, we developed a machine learning diagnostic model for T2DN. The model achieved an AUC of 0.877 in validation and performed well in an independent test cohort with an AUC of 0.824. MYO1C was identified as the most influential feature in the final model. Mechanistic investigations in vitro and in vivo revealed that high glucose and high-fat conditions induced podocyte injury, inflammation, and apoptosis, with increased MYO1C expression. MYO1C knockdown in vitro and in vivo reduced podocyte damage and inflammatory responses. MYO1C overexpression enhanced p38, p-CREB, and TNF-α levels, while p38 inhibition mitigated these effects. These findings support MYO1C not only as a potential urinary biomarker for T2DN but also as a key pathogenic driver that promotes podocyte injury via p38 MAPK signaling, thereby highlighting its therapeutic promise.","","",""

We measure pancreas size and shape using morphological measurements from early development through aging (ages 0-90). Our goals are to (1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for artificial intelligence (AI) based pancreas measurement, (2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and (3) detect potential deviations in type 2 diabetes. We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged with abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients did not have cancer, pancreas pathology, sepsis, or trauma. We resampled the scans to 3 mm isotropic resolution, segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed pancreas volume trajectories in 1858 control patients across contrast CT, non-contrast CT, and MRI to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends. Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used covariate-adjusted generative additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) regression to model pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2 diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with type 2 diabetes. We selected CT for the main analyses of this study, since the MRI appeared to yield different pancreas measurements than CT using our AI-based method on this dataset of clinically acquired scans. When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13 morphological features were significantly different between patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons corrections). Additionally, we characterized normative morphological aging trends of the pancreas across 13 morphological measurements. We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape of the pancreas are altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and 675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a clinical setting.","","",""

Despite its clinical importance, progress in diabetes research is often constrained by the limited availability of comprehensive datasets and robust predictive models. To address these challenges, researchers are increasingly turning to big data analytics and machine learning (ML) methodologies. This study presents the development of an ML-based system aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes and classifying its various types. A novel dataset, termed Diabetes Types Dataset, was constructed by integrating four heterogeneous dataset sources: paediatrics data from the Mansoura University Children Hospital repository, the Pima Indian Diabetes (PIMA) dataset, the Pone dataset, and a Gestational Diabetes dataset. The classification of diabetes types was approached as a multiclass problem using a suite of supervised ML algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Adaptive Boosting, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Model performance was evaluated using several metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Mean Squared Error, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. Among the models tested, the ANN classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving a peak performance of 99.98%. Further validation was conducted using an external dataset referred to as diabetes_prediction, which confirmed the model's robustness with consistent accuracy. Additionally, the proposed system was applied to a publicly available dataset, diabetes_Dataset, containing 34 features used to predict 12 distinct types of diabetes efficiently. The results suggest that this ML-driven approach can significantly enhance the ability of healthcare professionals to detect and classify diabetes types, thereby supporting early intervention and improved disease management.","","",""

A biodegradable porous zinc (Zn) scaffold incorporating sustained-release Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1), referred to as Zn-NGR1, was developed using powder metallurgy and impregnation techniques. Comprehensive characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the scaffold's morphology, composition, and controlled NGR1 release. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic and ovariectomized (OVX) rat model with femoral fractures, Zn-NGR1 implantation markedly accelerated fracture healing, enhanced angiogenesis as demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (IHC/IF) analysis for cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and improved mechanical strength in three-point bending tests. Bone volume fraction (BV/TV) increased by 20 % compared with controls. Transcriptomic profiling (RNA sequencing, RNA-seq) combined with network pharmacology and machine learning analysis identified the stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) signaling axis as the principal pathway activated by NGR1. In vitro, Zn-NGR1 significantly enhanced bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration, promoted osteogenic differentiation, and stimulated angiogenesis through SDF-1/CXCR4 upregulation, confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis. In vivo validation demonstrated that Zn-NGR1 facilitates diabetic fracture healing by activating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, thereby promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

In medical education, the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) has transformational potential in realising these objectives through creating inclusive, innovative, and adaptive learning spaces. This scoping review considers the use of AI and STEAM-based curriculum design and assessment to further SDG-4 within medical education for the purposes of enhancing inclusivity, scalability, and ethical practice. Adopting the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, researchers systematically charted peer-reviewed literature obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. 50 studies were identified, with prominent themes being: AI-oriented personalised learning, STEAM-based interdisciplinary education, and issues such as ethical dilemmas, digital divides, and curriculum congestion. The review uncovers a significant absence of standard frameworks to implement AI and suggests the INSPIRE Model (Inclusive, Nimble, Scalable, Personalised, Interprofessional, Reflective, and Ethical) as a new framework to fill these gaps. The INSPIRE Model uses AI-powered technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems and real-time analytics, in conjunction with STEAM principles to produce adaptive, modular curricula that address the needs of various types of learners, including those in low-resource environments. It advocates for ethical use of AI, Interprofessional collaboration, and AI literacy in order to equip medical students for an AI-enhanced healthcare future. Evidence shows that integration of AI and STEAM can promote access to quality education, narrow gaps, and drive critical thinking, in line with SDG-4 goals. Yet, access impediments such as scarce infrastructure and faculty development call for specific interventions like international partnerships and scalable digital tools. The INSPIRE Model provides a blueprint for stakeholders to integrate inclusive, sustainable systems of medical education. Subsequent studies should aim to pilot-test the model and assess its long-term effect on educational equity as well as on health outcomes, while being guided by SDG-4's vision of lifelong learning for all.

- **Reasoning:** The paper focuses on integrating AI into medical and dental curricula, not on diabetes data, wearables, CGM, imaging, or related AI/ML challenges.","The dawn of artificial intelligence (AI) signifies a pivotal shift in medical and dental education. Integrating AI into the curriculum modernizes learning and equips future healthcare professionals with crucial tools for the 21st century. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the limitations of conventional educational models, necessitating rapid adaptation to remote and online learning environments. This disruption expedited the transition to digital platforms, laying the foundation for further integration of technology, including AI, into medical education. What began as an emergency response has now become a permanent feature of the educational landscape, evolving from static textbooks to dynamic digital platforms that offer greater accessibility, inclusivity, and personalization of learning experiences.1 In the AI era, it is insufficient to merely digitize the curriculum; a comprehensive transformation is essential. The digital curriculum opens new avenues for interactive learning environments, simulation-based practices, and adaptive learning algorithms that respond to the individual needs of students. AI-driven tools such as virtual patient simulations, diagnostic decision-making platforms, and predictive analytics have the potential to revolutionize how medical students learn, practice, and apply their knowledge in clinical settings.2 These innovations allow for an enhanced learning experience where students can interact with realistic patient cases and make informed decisions, fostering a deeper understanding of clinical practice.
 
One of the most promising applications of AI in medical education is its role as an educational partner. AI-powered platforms can function as personalized tutors, providing real-time feedback, adjusting learning modules based on student performance, and even predicting areas where additional support may be required.3 Adaptive learning systems can analyze the learner’s pace and comprehension, offering tailored resources to bridge knowledge gaps. This personalized approach to education ensures that no student is left behind, addressing one of the longstanding challenges of traditional, one-size-fits-all curricula. Additionally, AI can enhance clinical reasoning through simulation and data-driven case scenarios. By analyzing patterns in patient data, AI algorithms can help medical students gain deeper insights into complex clinical decision-making processes. This data-driven approach can significantly improve learners’ ability to diagnose and plan treatments, thereby improving clinical outcomes. While AI and digital tools offer substantial benefits, the role of educators remains essential in this new educational paradigm. Rather than replacing teachers, AI will augment their roles, allowing them to focus on mentorship, critical thinking, and the ethical dimensions of healthcare.4 Educators will need to reimagine their roles, becoming facilitators of learning who guide students in interpreting and applying AI-generated data in clinical settings. As AI takes on administrative tasks such as grading, educators can dedicate more time to meaningful interactions with students.5 However, this shift toward AI-driven curricula also requires significant investment in faculty development. Educators must be trained in the use of AI tools and possess a thorough understanding of their applications to ensure that AI is used responsibly and effectively in shaping future healthcare professionals.
 
As AI becomes more integrated into medical education, addressing the ethical challenges associated with this technology becomes crucial. While AI-driven tools hold great promise, they must be designed and deployed with an acute awareness of biases, data privacy concerns, and the risk of over-reliance on algorithms in clinical decision-making.6 The digital curriculum must provide students with technical skills and a strong ethical foundation for AI use in healthcare. Students must be trained to critically evaluate AI outputs, understand their limitations, and ensure that human judgment remains central to patient care. Transforming medical curricula in the AI era is not without challenges. Digital divides, access to technology, and the initial cost of AI-driven platforms may pose barriers to widespread adoption. Institutions must ensure equitable access to resources for all students, regardless of their geographic or socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, regulatory bodies such as the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) must revise standards to accommodate these technological advancements. In conclusion, the transformation of medical and dental curricula into a digital, AI-enhanced model represents not only a modernization of education but also a fundamental shift in preparing future healthcare professionals. By embracing AI as an educational partner, medical institutions can create personalized, data-driven learning environments that equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in an increasingly complex healthcare landscape. The integration of AI into the curriculum offers an opportunity to empower the next generation of doctors, enabling them to navigate future challenges with confidence and competence. Now is the time for this transformation, and it is a journey that we must embark on collectively to ensure the future of education, healthcare, and patient care.","","",""

However, the shared molecular mechanisms linking T2DM and atherosclerosis have not been fully elucidated. We analyzed AS- and T2DM-related gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify overlapping differentially expressed genes and co-expression signatures. Functional enrichment (Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were then used to describe the pathways and interaction modules associated with these shared signatures, We next applied the cytoHubba algorithm together with several machine learning methods to prioritize hub genes and evaluate their diagnostic potential and combined CIBERSORT-based immune cell infiltration analysis with single-cell RNA sequencing data to examine cell types and the expression patterns of the shared genes in specific cell populations. We identified 72 shared feature genes. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes revealed significant enrichment of inflammatory- and metabolism-related pathways. Three genes-IL1B, MMP9, and P2RY13-emerged as shared hub genes and yielded robust ANN-based predictive performance across datasets. Immune deconvolution and single-cell analyses consistently indicated inflammatory amplification and an imbalance of macrophage polarization in both conditions. Biology mapped to the hubs suggests IL1B drives inflammatory signaling, MMP9 reflects extracellular-matrix remodeling, and P2RY13 implicates cholesterol transport. Collectively, these findings indicate that T2DM and AS converge on immune and inflammatory processes with macrophage dysregulation as a central axis; IL1B, MMP9, and P2RY13 represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets and may influence disease progression by regulating macrophage states, supporting translational application to diagnosis and treatment of T2DM-related atherosclerosis. These findings are preliminary. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm their validity, given the limitations of the present study.","","",""

In recent decades, periodontal care has transitioned from a reactive model toward a preventive, risk-oriented approach supported by structured prediction systems. Various clinical risk assessment tools, including the hexagonal periodontal risk assessment (PRA), modified PRA (MPRA), UniFe/PerioRisk, SmartRisk, DentoRisk, and the Periodontal Risk Calculator (PRC/PreViser), have been designed to quantify and visualise an individual's susceptibility to disease progression.

A comprehensive search identified health economic evaluations of AI applications published between September 2019 and March 2025, following PRISMA and SWiM guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42025641230). Eligible studies were full economic evaluations comparing AI-based interventions with non-AI alternatives, and data were extracted on study characteristics, analytical methods, decision-analytic models, perspectives, outcomes, and AI-specific costs. Methodological quality was evaluated using the CHEERS checklist. A total of 52 studies from 15 countries were included, most published after 2020, focusing on diabetic retinopathy screening, cancer detection, and cardiovascular disease applications. Cost-utility analysis was the predominant method (79%), followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (15%). Nearly all studies (98%) concluded that AI-based strategies were cost-effective, cost-beneficial, or cost-saving. However, reporting of AI-specific costs was inconsistent, while over 90% of studies detailed expenses such as software licensing, per-test charges, or maintenance fees, some omitted cost information entirely, limiting comparability. Overall, AI-based healthcare interventions are generally reported as cost-effective, but methodological heterogeneity, incomplete cost reporting, and potential publication bias constrain the reliability and comparability of current evidence. Standardized economic evaluation frameworks that incorporate comprehensive cost structures and account for the evolving nature of AI are urgently needed.","","",""

To bridge this educational gap, it is imperative to impart practical skills for the utilisation and interpretation of AI in healthcare settings, integrate technology into clinical operations, develop AI technologies, and enhance human competencies [1]. The swift rise of AI in contemporary society can be ascribed to the progress of intricate algorithms, cost-effective graphic processors, and huge annotated databases. AI has been a crucial component of healthcare education in recent years and has been implemented by numerous medical institutions globally. AI is widely prevalent in medical education in Western countries, in contrast to developing countries. The disparity could be mitigated through more infrastructural assistance from medical institutions in underdeveloped nations. It is crucial to raise awareness among medical educators and students regarding AI tools to facilitate the development and integration of AI-based technologies in medical education [2]. AI can impact the student learning process through three methods: direct instruction (transferring knowledge to the student in a teacher-like role), instructional support (assisting students as they learn), and learner empowerment (facilitating collaboration among multiple students to solve complex problems based on teacher feedback). Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) tools into education can augment students' knowledge, foster skill acquisition, and deepen comprehension of intricate medical topics [2,3]. Virtual reality (VR) can enhance the immersion of learning sessions with virtual patients. Virtual Reality (VR) is a software-driven technology that generates a virtual environment with three-dimensional characteristics. Virtual Reality (VR) uses a head-mounted display or glasses to build a computer-simulated environment that provides a convincing and lifelike experience for the user. Conversely, augmented reality (AR) enhances the real-world environment by superimposing virtual elements onto a user's perspective of the actual world through a smartphone or similar device. By integrating these technologies, learners are able to investigate and actively participate in intricate clinical situations, resulting in a more pleasurable and efficient learning experience [4,5]. AI-powered games utilise data mining methodologies to examine the data gathered during gameplay and enhance the player's knowledge and abilities. In addition, they provide a personalised and engaging encounter that adapts the speed and level of challenge according to the player's achievements. Incorporating game components such as points, badges, and leaderboards enhances the enjoyment and engagement of the learning process. The implementation of gamification in the learning process boosts student engagement, fosters collaborative efforts, and optimises learning results. Additionally, they offer chances for clinical decision-making without any potential risks and provide instant feedback to the students, thereby becoming an essential component of undergraduate medical education [6]. By incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into learning management systems (LMS), learners are equipped with the necessary resources to achieve mastery at their own individualised pace. These computer algorithms assess the learner's level of understanding and deliver personalised educational material to help them achieve mastery of the content. The AI-powered platforms guide learners by effectively organising and arranging learning experiences, and then implementing targeted remedial actions. These customised and adaptable teaching techniques enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. Virtual patients are computer-based simulations that replicate real-life clinical events and are used for training and education in health professions. Virtual patients are built to simulate authentic symptoms, react to students' treatments, and create dynamic therapeutic encounters. The student assumes the position of a healthcare provider and engages in activities such as gathering information, proposing potential diagnoses, implementing medical treatment, and monitoring the patient's progress. These simulations can accurately reproduce a range of medical settings and expose trainees to the problems they might encounter in real-world situations. Medical students can enhance their communication and clinical reasoning skills by engaging with virtual patients in a simulated environment that closely resembles real-life situations [6,7]. Furthermore, AI-driven solutions can be advantageous for educational purposes in diagnostic fields such as radiology, pathology, and microbiology. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a highly promising method utilised in the field of radiology for educational and research purposes. CBIR facilitates the search for photos that have similar content with a reference image, utilising information extracted from the images [8]. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) integrated with machine learning techniques is currently being employed to accurately diagnose microbial illnesses. This application of AI has significant potential in training and educating specialists in the field of microbiology. Conversely, the current progress in AI-driven deep learning technologies that specifically target cellular imaging has the potential to revolutionise education in diagnostic pathology [9]. Ultimately, incorporating AI training into the medical education curriculum is a transformative step that will shape the future of healthcare practitioners. This sequence provides enhanced diagnostic precision, personalised learning prospects, and heightened ethical awareness. These potential benefits surpass the obstacles, initiating a new era in medical education where human beings and technology collaborate to deliver optimal patient care. The purposeful and calculated integration of AI into medical education will have a pivotal impact on shaping the future of healthcare as we navigate this unexplored territory. ","","",""

This comprehensive review synthesizes current research on AI applications within medical education, highlighting significant gaps between the growing clinical role of AI and its representation in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The review identifies disparities in AI awareness and utilization, with postgraduate trainees demonstrating greater familiarity than undergraduates, and notes that most existing educational efforts are concentrated in specialty training and continuing education, particularly in fields such as radiology, pathology, surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. While medical trainees generally express positive attitudes toward acquiring AI competencies, barriers such as the absence of standardized frameworks and AI taxonomy, limited faculty expertise, curricular constraints, and ethical considerations impede broader adoption. Drawing on examples of pioneering programs and a systematic analysis of curricular approaches, we propose a novel, tiered framework for comprehensive AI integration across the medical education continuum. This framework emphasizes universal AI literacy, critical evaluation skills, ethical awareness, and experiential learning at the undergraduate level, with extensions for specialty-specific training and advanced technical or leadership tracks. Recommendations include phased implementation strategies, faculty development initiatives, including “teach the teacher”, and competency-based assessment methods. The review concludes that adequate preparation of future physicians requires a shift from isolated AI initiatives to coordinated, longitudinal integration efforts supported by collaboration among educational institutions, professional societies, and technology experts. Future research should focus on evaluating educational outcomes, developing robust assessment tools for AI competencies, and examining the long-term clinical impact of AI training. ","","",""

This comprehensive review synthesizes current research on AI applications within medical education, highlighting significant gaps between the growing clinical role of AI and its representation in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The review identifies disparities in AI awareness and utilization, with postgraduate trainees demonstrating greater familiarity than undergraduates, and notes that most existing educational efforts are concentrated in specialty training and continuing education, particularly in fields such as radiology, pathology, surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. While medical trainees generally express positive attitudes toward acquiring AI competencies, barriers such as the absence of standardized frameworks and AI taxonomy, limited faculty expertise, curricular constraints, and ethical considerations impede broader adoption. Drawing on examples of pioneering programs and a systematic analysis of curricular approaches, we propose a novel, tiered framework for comprehensive AI integration across the medical education continuum. This framework emphasizes universal AI literacy, critical evaluation skills, ethical awareness, and experiential learning at the undergraduate level, with extensions for specialty-specific training and advanced technical or leadership tracks. Recommendations include phased implementation strategies, faculty development initiatives, including “teach the teacher”, and competency-based assessment methods. The review concludes that adequate preparation of future physicians requires a shift from isolated AI initiatives to coordinated, longitudinal integration efforts supported by collaboration among educational institutions, professional societies, and technology experts. Future research should focus on evaluating educational outcomes, developing robust assessment tools for AI competencies, and examining the long-term clinical impact of AI training. ","","",""

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on AI-augmented healthcare education, not on diabetes data, sensors, imaging, or clinical deployment; lacks any diabetes-specific AI/ML review or datasets.","Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) fundamentally transforms healthcare education as a knowledge enterprise, creating a distributed cognitive system composed of the human brain, which remains relatively unchanged, and AI-based knowledge and cognitive functions, which have accelerated exponentially in scale and power. Education must focus on developing skills to collaborate with AI and on achieving outcomes like problems solved and discoveries made. Curriculum and education policies also need to adapt to this transformation. ","","",""
